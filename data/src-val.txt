I saw Tom get off the bus.
I'd rather clean my room than spend time doing my homework.
Tom's daughter pretended not to know him when he came to pick her up from school in his battered old car.
Tom told me he wanted a lawyer.
It took ten years to build the amusement park.
Tom advised me to go there.
I don't think this is Tom's umbrella.
What else is needed?
It is already past five o'clock.
I'm not busy tonight.
He will live forever in our hearts.
We're so sorry.
I knew Tom wasn't going to change.
Do you believe in angels?
We went to Boston together.
My sister took care of the dog while I was away.
I'm waiting my turn.
Tom said he was going to kill Mary's dog.
I likely won't leave tomorrow.
I'm worried that Tom will get lost.
I get what I want.
I want a list of all Tom's relatives.
I don't want dinner.
I don't think Tom has any money left.
You can wait here.
Tom was strong.
Try hard.
I rewrote my report.
Tom will end up in jail.
I'll pass.
It's a beautiful rug.
I was badly beaten.
"Thank you very much, Tom."
These windows aren't clean.
I don't have time to explain.
Tom went with Mary to the museum.
There was an uncomfortable silence.
I work two jobs.
"Do you often buy things, and then regret it later?"
It came out of nowhere.
She gave him all of her silver.
I thought that I told you to keep the door closed.
Tom only kissed me once.
He tried to attract her attention.
How long do you think it would take to read this book?
Try to recall what happened.
Please hurry.
You have a very impressive resume.
Tom will be ready in a few minutes.
We had to walk all the way to the station.
I was grateful.
"Right now, I simply want to be alone."
Who came up with that idea in the first place?
Please do so.
Where are your dogs?
Why was everyone yelling at you?
I've never eaten raw fish.
I'm not in good shape.
You have my support.
I don't even own any tools.
Tom got caught speeding but was let off with a warning.
We knew that Tom would be late.
The last train has already gone.
I was dancing.
My hair is still wet.
Don't let Tom do it.
Switzerland is a neutral country.
"Drive more carefully, or you will have an accident."
Please tell me which to take.
Ah! What a beautiful flower!
Give me one minute.
"They are not enemies, but friends."
She finished ironing the clothes a few minutes ago.
Tom has three million dollars in the bank.
I hope that you will accept my request.
She baked me a cake.
There's something on your neck.
Don't forget to buy milk.
"The older one grows, the weaker one's memory becomes."
Tell me where to go next.
This is not your best work.
Tom and Mary haven't come yet.
That was probably what influenced their decision.
You said I could see Tom.
Do you really think this is going to work?
Do you know where you're going?
I'm sure you'll find a way.
I need to make it work.
We aren't sleeping.
I think I did that wrong.
Don't hang up the laundry yet.
He silently went out of the room.
Do you know Tom's father?
"Tom says he wants to come, too."
Tom scratched his nose.
It's your own fault that that happened.
There are many such birds in the park.
Tom says it's OK.
The walls of my room are too thin.
It doesn't ring any bells.
I need to get this done.
Don't stand next to the window.
They've lied to me.
How many hospitals are there in Boston?
"From now on, I will not use that word."
When are you coming to Boston?
My driver's license will expire next week.
I have a bottle of whiskey.
Can you tell me what Tom said?
I'm not at all busy.
That's what I need to do.
How well do you know Tom?
Tom asked Mary to find out where John was.
Tom is wearing John's T-shirt.
I didn't wait in line.
Who told you the story?
The paper is under the table.
She seldom goes to places like that.
I knew Tom couldn't speak French.
What kind of sports do you do?
Do you recognize that guy?
May I kiss you?
That's easy for you to say.
You've got 24 hours.
You can come in.
Tie your shoe.
Tom doesn't sing very well.
"Tom tried to help me, but I told him I didn't need his help."
I must speak to Tom about Mary.
"Could you bring us the bill, please?"
Tom has to go to the hospital.
I haven't seen Tom since he left.
I suspect that Tom has already left Boston.
This is very important to us.
Tom still hasn't done what we asked him to do.
Would you like for me to make you something to eat?
I've always wanted to climb Mt. Fuji.
I want to see everything.
What kind of place is it?
This book belongs to the library.
That's what you're good at.
I was quite upset.
Why is no one here?
I've been out of town all week.
"If that's true, then she's better than me."
I was here when you came in.
It's just a theory.
You intimidate Tom.
I don't have any cats.
I don't know where we'll live next year.
I have a splinter in the palm of my hand.
The population of this city has decreased.
I told Tom you used to live in Boston.
He liked that.
"May I have your name and telephone number, please?"
I'm your boss.
I want you to meet Tom.
Where did you learn to read?
Where is Tom from?
Please send me a picture of yourself.
Did anything surprise you?
That's all I got.
I am tired from walking.
We should've stayed with you.
Tom cut down the tree that was in front of his house.
I did it once.
"Tom promised to come, but he didn't."
I want to see what happens.
Tom was very nervous at first.
I gave Mary a book.
Tom moved to Australia after his divorce.
Tom finally agreed to help us.
I think Tom was bluffing.
You've got to hide.
I was wrong as usual.
Tom wrote that song three years ago.
Tom is alone.
Why aren't you asleep?
The whole world was involved in the war.
I'm terrified.
Why are you looking at me like that?
He had nothing to do with it.
There were no seats left.
How many times have you been to Australia?
The light is out.
Tom and I'll meet you there.
We're all waiting for you.
The gas tank is almost empty.
I heard a strange noise coming from Tom's room last night.
That car is quite new.
You can come with us.
This could become a serious problem.
Show me that list.
The house is on fire!
Let me show you how I do that.
Tom will be so proud of you.
How long have you worked for Tom?
I think this is great.
It was an unforgettable experience.
May I sit here?
My friend gave me a silk scarf.
I've used up three notebooks.
Aren't you retired?
I don't think that Tom has health insurance.
We need to replace our hot water heater.
Please promise that you won't tell anyone.
You didn't seem to enjoy the concert very much.
Why did you sell your car?
I came here to see you.
Tom met Mary at the door.
Are you sure you don't want me to help?
Did you bring an umbrella with you?
Tom asked if I wanted him to cook something for me.
This is my bicycle.
They'll hear us.
I didn't think this would happen.
"Is it serious, Doctor?"
I'll ask Tom to send you a copy.
What else are you good at doing?
No one had an answer.
Tom quickly got to work.
Tom wasn't the one that did that.
Her beauty is indescribable.
Tom asked me what the problem was.
I wish I hadn't promised Tom I'd go to Boston with him.
Tom is always laughing.
We can't do that without you.
I see you're all awake.
You're so diligent.
Tom chatted with Mary.
Do we have a test tomorrow?
I didn't know that you had so much money.
Tom is here to talk.
Have you ever thought about committing suicide?
I wouldn't talk to Tom anymore if I were you.
"May I have the check, please?"
Your help isn't needed anymore.
I was swamped with homework.
I really have to go to bed.
I framed Tom.
I don't remember how Tom reacted.
"Some people were sunbathing, others were swimming."
How could it have been done?
Do you like the way Tom sings?
"Tom met Mary at a party, and it was love at first sight."
I explained the rule to Tom.
My new shoes are comfortable.
Tom put his hands on my shoulders.
I ordered those books from Germany.
Tom pressed his nose against the glass.
This fish is done.
They're cold.
The mouse ate the cheese.
Why didn't you tell us you knew French?
Who knows what all this will come to.
I'm a little late.
Why don't you and Tom stay with us?
Close the box.
I'll do that for you if you want me to.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
You can always try doing it by yourself.
Didn't I ask you not to dance with Tom?
I'm not used to it.
Tom plays the flute.
"Coffee, please, with cream and sugar."
He regained consciousness and was able to talk.
Tom asked us what we wanted to do.
My father was already at home when I came back.
We left early.
It's too much.
I suspect Tom knows this already.
I need to wash my car.
You should've stayed in Boston.
Tom was confused by Mary's request.
Tom gave Mary a light kiss on the cheek.
Don't pay any attention to what people say.
I know where they're taking Tom.
Tom is never sober.
Can I stay here with you?
We took shelter under a tree.
"If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask."
Tom said Mary was busy.
I should be with Tom.
The seed is beginning to germinate.
Tom would like to know what's going to happen.
There's no explanation for what happened to Tom.
Tom doesn't know a lot about animals.
Tom didn't say anything about you.
What are we here for?
You know what to do.
"I'll have a cup of coffee, please."
I have a job interview at two o'clock tomorrow afternoon.
I wonder what Tom is thinking.
Is Tom still with Mary?
Did you have fun?
Let's ask Tom.
Did the plane crash?
We'll pay for it.
"Oh, by the way, do you know where she lives now?"
He put on an air of innocence.
Tom can come back tomorrow.
Did you see Tom's face?
It looks like you know Tom already.
It's already past ten o'clock.
"Tom, come here quickly!"
"He shouted, ""Get out!"""
She waited for him to call.
Tom wrote his name in the sand with a stick.
What're your plans for the future?
Let's hear your excuse.
I'll be with you.
This winter is warm.
It looks like Tom was able to get what he wanted.
They are eating their apples.
Tom wants to meet Mary's family.
What makes you smile?
I can't go back there alone.
Have you ever visited Boston?
I asked you to be quiet.
Many people disagreed with the judge's decision.
It's very strange.
Are you sure you don't want to swim with us?
Are there any more details?
You should acknowledge your failure.
I'm glad you're OK again.
The Chinese are a hard-working people.
Cooking is fun.
The paintings were in very good condition.
How much does it cost to get downtown by bus?
Is your room clean?
I'll personally visit you.
Germany produced many scientists.
Be objective.
I'm just thinking.
Tom apologized to Mary for eating her sandwich.
Tom planned to stay in the army.
Look at the moon.
Bring a lunch.
Turn off the light.
We're not wealthy.
Tom can understand Mary's French.
We'll convince them.
How old were you when your father was killed?
Maybe I'll bring Tom.
Tom says he's homesick.
We need to protect Tom.
Tom is going to sign it.
I can't remember that.
You were right about one thing.
Ask Tom where Mary lives.
I'm not so good at tennis.
The hall was filled with such a large audience that there wasn't even standing room.
Give Tom a kiss.
When was the last time you went fishing?
We'll always be friends.
My mother is making dinner.
Tom bought a bathrobe.
I wonder if Tom can do what we've asked.
It's sort of personal.
I had been studying music in Boston before I returned to Japan.
How long will you stay?
We will go on a picnic tomorrow.
Where's the bread?
I gave the boy a book.
Hamburgers aren't made from ham.
Tom shut the kitchen door.
She works for French intelligence.
It is a white lie.
Tell me what you want me to do.
Tom has no desire to do that.
Tom didn't know why Mary wanted to do that.
Tom was my first husband.
Words cannot describe the beauty.
He was attacked by a shark.
Can you tell me what that means?
It looks incredible.
When do you stop work?
Have you ever played tennis with Tom?
What do you know about our company?
Tom promised Mary he'd come home early.
Tom knows this.
I'll have to call back.
Please say it in English.
Did anyone tell you?
Tell Tom he has to wash the dishes.
I'm used to doing this kind of thing.
I'm coming back next week.
She felt like crying.
Tom is disappointed with the results.
I'm not the one who told Tom to leave.
Can you predict the future?
The bullet entered above the knee.
It was already very late.
Don't smoke here.
Tom insists I come alone.
My legs are hurting.
Be fair.
Tom asked Mary to come again.
We have to look after our parents.
Tom is losing consciousness.
Tom poured more coffee for himself.
He reached home shortly before five o'clock.
The supermarket didn't have what I wanted.
Please don't leave.
I can't go with you.
Your phone rang several times while you were in the shower.
I don't think that Tom knows where Mary is.
Let's talk about your family.
I don't think Tom has a driver's license.
I'm not going to sing that song anymore.
Tom and Mary are still very busy.
Tom saved her from the fire.
I like to travel by myself.
Excuse me.
Do you think that's possible?
It was mine.
Your parents will never allow you to go.
I know you hate funerals.
I got lost in the cave.
Tom wasn't there today.
I can not answer your question.
Do you think they'll find us here?
"I don't want to stay here anymore, Tom."
Tom didn't need it.
Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone.
I think it's time for me to close the window.
I want to lodge a formal complaint.
Tom's honesty is beyond all question.
I've waited for it.
All three died.
The helicopter landed on the roof.
Put on the hat.
One day Tom just up and left.
Where is the check-in counter?
I bought everything that you asked for.
He tries to improve his English.
I think it won't be a problem.
Nobody likes Tom.
My secretary has a good command of the English language.
I completely forgot about Tom.
I told Tom not to worry.
Tom drinks beer.
I didn't know you could play the trombone.
I have to see you.
"If something goes wrong, call me."
They're dangerous.
They wouldn't stop.
Did I surprise you?
"You have somebody you can talk to, don't you?"
I thought we'd surprise you.
Thank you for the beautiful flowers.
I didn't want to help Tom.
Don't touch my guitar.
I think I'm sick.
Do you want to look at it?
I wasn't wearing a lifejacket.
You won't be let down if you read the entire book.
I'm Tom's bodyguard.
It is no use giving her advice.
He keeps his word.
You can't hypnotize me.
Justice will prevail.
Look how happy Tom is.
Have you found out anything?
Do you have a house?
Keep in touch!
Not everyone is like you.
Did you hear what I just said?
I don't have a radio.
Tell Tom why you can't go.
Try to keep up with him.
What kind of medicine did you take?
Let me do that.
I think that Tom will be able to help us do that.
What happened yesterday?
Get down from your horse.
I didn't want to embarrass you in front of your friends.
I'm an athlete.
I threw up.
Tom was lying to you.
I wanted you to have it.
Do you really not like stawberries?
How long have you been looking for it?
Open the gate.
Does Coca-Cola contain caffeine?
Tom opened the door of the van and jumped out.
Am I doing the right thing?
I don't think that it'll rain.
Are these children yours?
Tom will return tomorrow.
Tom tried to persuade me to go with him.
Stop the car immediately.
Tom was diagnosed with colon cancer in October of 2013.
Please write to me once in a while.
I think you should go see a doctor.
Tom had to pawn his guitar in order to pay his bills.
I can't bear it.
I know that you're Canadian.
Tom lay awake almost all night thinking about Mary.
Tom was hoping the committee would adopt his proposal.
Who are you describing?
I thought I was just lucky.
Maybe the two parties will be able to come to an understanding.
No one really knows what happened.
Tom was very busy yesterday.
A truck hit the dog.
Evidently he does not want to speak to me.
We have to escape.
We must think about peaceful uses of atomic energy.
We are going to travel in a group this summer.
I want to make Tom proud of me.
I want to tell you something important.
"You need patience, Tom."
The rest is easy.
Tom told Mary she wouldn't need to do that.
Don't call him names.
You've arrived too early.
Do you always do what Tom tells you?
Tom said you wanted to talk to me.
Tom and Mary aren't finished.
I became a Catholic.
I told them to stop.
I have something to ask of you.
It looks cheap.
He is much better than you.
Tokyo's air pollution problem is even worse than that of New York.
I study very little.
Tom doesn't know French at all.
Tom doesn't know how much time it'll take him to do that.
Tom will be here within the hour.
The English are said to be conservative.
Call me.
Tom has co-authored three textbooks.
It's absurd.
I wrote a letter last night.
She has the ability to speak and write French.
Health is more important than money.
Tom was very convincing.
I'm at the beach.
After death there is nothing.
I won't breathe a word.
"Easy come, easy go."
I thought I'd go with you.
It has just started to snow in Vicenza.
Do you come to school by bicycle?
Why are we fighting?
I was almost home when the car ran out of gas.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to teach you a lesson.
I went on reading.
You should tell Tom he's wrong.
Two months have passed since he left for France.
Tom parked the car.
She told me once and for all that she did not want to see me again.
Tom quietly closed the bedroom door.
I think Tom knows why Mary isn't here.
I knew I shouldn't say anything.
You don't need it.
He is a gentleman in every way.
This store sells old books.
The movie's about to start.
Wolves scare me.
I will wait here till he comes.
"It's heavy, but I can manage it."
Tom was killed by a land mine.
I have to memorize this poem.
"Tom might be here somewhere, but I haven't seen him."
Tom didn't poison anybody.
Tom did a quick calculation in his head.
The motorcycle I borrowed from him broke down.
"Generally speaking, women live longer than men."
Tom refused to eat.
"If you want to go, go."
My sister's hair reaches to her shoulders.
He'll be here until noon.
Bunnies are so cute.
Tom is way taller than Mary.
We didn't have computers when I was growing up.
"If you do that, everyone's going to hate you."
I use it.
There's too much at stake.
He was wounded in the battle.
The door had been axed by the firefighters.
Send Tom to me.
I told you I'm not ready.
I want to see Tom first.
My grandmother had an operation in Germany.
How could I have forgotten that?
Do you really want me to buy this for you?
Stay away.
Tom got up late.
Tom is magnificent.
Did Tom already know that?
Tom has no idea where to start.
You were acting like a baby.
She is very fond of dogs.
"Which is older, this book or that one?"
Tom isn't very sleepy.
Tom refused to take part in the game.
I want to know what you're doing here.
Are you a singer?
I haven't seen you in a long time.
I love my mother.
That's why I told you about this.
I don't think that Tom can play the trumpet.
They concluded he was lying.
The sun sank below the horizon.
You always blame me for your unhappiness.
Just tell Tom I'm looking for him.
Don't let Tom drink any milk.
I'll never go there.
He is well known in our country.
Do you want to get something to eat?
Has anyone ever told you that you're beautiful?
Tom didn't offer me anything to drink.
Are you still interested?
I thought Tom might want it.
It's your duty to finish the job.
Tom says that Mary won.
It didn't work out.
Pandas spend at least 12 hours each day eating bamboo.
Modern technology has made our lives more comfortable.
"Tom is in the kitchen, cutting up some vegetables."
Someone stole my rucksack.
Tom lost their trust.
Tom saved your life.
We can't be seen together.
I'm going to get something to eat.
Save it for later.
That has happened to me several times.
The police want to talk to you.
Tom is hyperactive.
You're way too late.
I don't think that that would cost very much.
Why did Tom lie about his age?
It's time to go to bed.
I can't afford to have children.
"Last year, I was in Australia."
Why do you want work for our company?
Do you still have Tom's umbrella?
I admire your grit.
Is Tom going to go with us tomorrow?
Do you know what Tom needs?
He fixed the problem in a jiffy.
I don't want to show it to Tom yet.
We have a visitor.
I didn't want to help Tom.
She likes taking pictures.
We have no need for assistance.
Tom doesn't waste time.
She has beautiful eyes.
"I had to wait for Tom's reply for a long time, but it was worth it."
He rejected our offer.
Tom wears clothes made by his mother.
It rained continuously all day.
I was glad to help.
The price rose.
Let your uncle think about it.
I'm working in Australia.
"In 1955, the cancer returned and she died in 1956 at the age of 42."
I leave it up to you.
"You don't understand what's going on, do you?"
Tom ordered pizza for everyone.
Keep an eye on the boys. They're mischievous.
I'm planning to stay at a hotel.
I wish nothing but the best for you.
I have to wash my clothes.
Tom doesn't have any plans for tomorrow.
I'm probably wrong.
We're going to be rescued.
There is a map on the table.
She tried to screen her son from reality.
Tom threw his son out of the house.
We've done the best we can.
Too much stress can lead to physical disease.
I don't approve of it.
"He is tall, but his brother is much taller."
Human trafficking is a crime.
You were rude.
I don't think that I'll be alone.
Tom certainly fooled Mary.
I know Tom and his wife.
He walks his dog every morning.
Does this look good on me?
Everybody had problems with Tom.
It's very bad.
You shouldn't eat just before going to bed.
I'll be turning thirty soon.
I could do nothing.
"He's my uncle, because my father is his brother."
I won't always be around to help you.
Give me your book.
I'm leaving it to you.
Tom persuaded Mary to sing a duet with him.
Is everybody hungry?
Where do you think Tom went?
Tom heard a noise and went outside to see what it was.
Tom likes all kinds of sports.
I'm still with Tom.
Tom's hobby is golf.
Tom arrived very late.
I thank you with all my heart.
Half of you are idiots.
What game are you playing?
I've been kicked out of school.
Are you going to bed early tonight?
She was run over by a car.
Draw a straight line through it.
What is it you'd like to know?
No one expected this.
Should I ask Tom?
We're still together.
It must be Tom.
I bet you didn't know that.
Tom asked Mary a question.
I wonder who'll come.
We received some sad news today.
Nobody voted for Tom.
Please don't call me anymore.
Do you believe these rumors?
You need to eat vegetables every day.
What a relief!
I hope that I pass the exam.
Close the window before going to bed.
Do you play football?
I'm not going to be afraid again.
Don't let the cat out of the bag.
Were you outdoors today?
It was the wrong thing to do.
I knew Tom wouldn't dance.
I don't understand what's happening.
Tom quarters are near the camp.
Tom disliked Mary.
Can I get a tattoo?
Maybe you were right.
I didn't want to work there.
I'd like to dance.
I just want to be Tom's friend.
Look! There's a bird in that tree.
Why is it my turn?
That was a total waste of my time.
I told a joke.
Can you die from fear?
We used to have three cars.
I heard you were rich.
"She has about 2,000 books."
Tom will sign it.
Tom is a pilot.
They got it wrong.
Leave everything.
"Knowing is one thing, teaching quite another."
Tom didn't say how much it cost.
It's awful.
I drank a lot of coffee.
She lost her son in the war.
You aren't thinking.
"Tom didn't have any hard evidence, but he thought Mary was the one who stole his mother's diamond ring."
I know it was Tom.
Tom slipped on a banana peel.
Why are your fingerprints are on this glass?
Diligence is essential to success in life.
Leave your umbrella in the hall.
"Believe it or not, she has three children."
It was cloudy all day long today.
Maybe Tom likes you.
Do I seem old to you?
Do you think that Tom has enough money to buy that?
I'll fix that.
My bed is more comfortable than yours.
Tom has some serious doubts.
Be friendly.
I want to make you happy.
They sent for the doctor.
Do you have a recent photo of yourself?
I had my eyes checked.
Which one do you think Tom is going to buy?
I'm going shopping.
I'm defenseless.
Tom isn't wearing a new hat.
We don't know how to use it.
I thought this might interest you.
Will I see Tom later?
He was looking out the window.
Mary made her sister a new dress.
He gave a positive answer to my question.
Speak when you are spoken to.
I feel kind of sorry for Tom.
What are you going to tell me now?
"Get used to it, Tom."
"This is a joke, right?"
I don't think that it's going to be hard to do that.
Whose house is this?
What do you know?
I don't like cops.
Tom got over his cold.
Tom surrendered.
What happened that night?
Your friend Tom told me to give this to you.
Are you sure you're not hungry?
Tom is a very good dancer.
I wasn't allowed to enter.
The ice is too hard to crack.
I decided to go there.
I heard noises in the garage.
Who do you know in Boston?
I hate to be alone at home on the weekends.
I can't remember where I parked my car.
The compromise was accepted.
My mother made me study.
I thought you wanted to go to Boston with us.
You cheated.
Tom wore this.
Why do you like doing this?
Tom isn't as bad as you think.
Please give that to me.
Didn't you know that Tom had a house on Park Street?
"You're the one who wanted to talk to Tom, not me."
I wonder why Tom lies so much.
No one said anything to us.
Tom didn't know who I was.
Aren't you ever going to sleep?
I have contacts in the White House.
Weigh yourself every day.
Tom needs a bottle opener.
Tom saw a ship in the distance.
I met her by accident at the bus stop.
Tom threw his son out of the house.
Tom rides a bicycle.
I do want to know what you found out.
Don't push it.
The police couldn't find any footprints outside Tom's bedroom window.
Let's not talk about it anymore.
Tom is a lot taller than I am.
Bus drivers aren't the only ones who are on strike.
Tom is a childhood friend.
Tom tried to do that once.
Tom is talking.
It's going to be quite hot today.
Tom does only what he's told to do.
Tom told Mary that he didn't think it was a good idea for her to go jogging in the park by herself.
Is there anything you want me to tell Tom?
We're trapped!
Tom should keep his mouth shut.
I'd like to leave this town and never come back.
Tom doesn't know his exact date of birth.
There's nothing else in the drawer.
Do you know what causes that?
He is proud of his punctuality.
His car is small and takes up little room.
What made you decide to come here now?
"Sorry, but you can't go in there."
Are you saying you can't fix it?
Tom picked up the water bottle and took a drink.
Why are you always so pessimistic?
Tom isn't a bookkeeper.
I've done nothing.
Should I call the police?
How many people survived?
I know what can happen here.
Do you mind if I eat here with you?
This is totally insane.
Tom has already told Mary to do that.
You may stay here.
Tom sounded irritated.
I've already done everything Tom asked me to do.
Tom doesn't know if he will come or not.
We think so.
A Japanese businessman bought the artwork for 200 million yen.
Dozens of letters are awaiting you.
It's disappointing.
Either Tom is wrong or I am.
I think you'll like the dessert.
The kitchen is downstairs.
He keeps a diary in English.
Tom answered Mary's question.
Let's not do that.
I didn't know that soccer was such a dangerous sport.
I know Tom is afraid.
They've just returned.
You won't get rid of me so easily.
Do you have any idea who might've killed Tom?
Tom said that I looked tired.
I would probably have done the same thing.
Tom is tall and handsome.
That's a question I hear all the time.
Tom said he would call you later.
Don't tell me what I can't do.
Tell him to call me tomorrow at noon.
Should we wait for Tom?
I didn't know about you.
Tom will go there.
Tom won't like you.
You remind me of myself when I was your age.
I have a flat tire.
I promise I'll pay you back the money I owe you before the end of the month.
He could swim fast enough to pass the test.
Tom doesn't seem unhappy.
What did your mom say?
Tom could have survived if the ambulance had arrived a little sooner.
Please don't mumble.
That's easy.
Tom shouldn't have told Mary.
What does Tom have to do with this?
Tom works at night.
Your socks don't match.
Why didn't Tom tell Mary to stay?
"You're only pretending to study, aren't you?"
Didn't you know that Tom was going to be here today?
I saw the cat.
Tom does everything Mary tells him to.
Tom's out of the country.
Tom repeated what he had just said.
All living things on Earth contain carbon.
Tom doesn't like fishing.
Tom is a man with many talents.
Tom won't be able to do that that soon.
The wind is blowing from the east.
How many children do you already have?
I think we spoke on the phone.
You need a drink.
"You know Tom, don't you?"
I hope Tom sticks around.
Give Tom what he needs.
Tom said you speak French better than Mary.
Don't put yourself out on my account.
I hope that you'll accept my request.
Tom will regret it sooner or later.
He was very busy all day.
You're tough.
The place was almost empty.
We don't have school tomorrow.
You don't have a chance.
A native speaker wouldn't likely say it that way.
Tom blushed when he saw Mary naked.
You looked scared.
Tom is safe.
You're a good singer.
About how much money do you need?
Tom's snoring.
The show starts at 2:30.
Does it offend you?
I'm old enough to do that by myself.
Tom got off at the next station.
What's that bird called?
"Don't you think that if I could help you, I would?"
You gave me too much.
How did you like Australia?
The police had reasons to suspect Tom.
Do you have a freezer?
This milk tastes terrible.
Tom didn't turn in his homework on time.
I don't think that I like you.
I was on close terms with him.
You'll be asleep by the time your father gets home.
I am calling my father.
I lost the charger to my phone.
I don't have time to do it.
Tom has straight hair.
Thanks for letting me speak.
We are spending the night at my uncle's house.
Tom is a Boston native.
Tom is a ghostwriter.
Tom didn't feel well.
Where's your home?
That was a complete waste of time.
Tom didn't want to believe me.
Tom remained silent the whole time.
She surprised me.
I'll keep doing it.
You left your headlights on.
Tom really likes his job.
Please wake me up at 6:30.
Look at Tom's face.
Can you explain why Tom wasn't at the meeting?
I got married 8 years ago.
Tom has no manners at all.
I stayed in Boston for three days.
I'm not afraid of Tom.
Registration isn't required.
Tom has trouble remembering people's names.
Hold your breath.
Tom and I both want to go home.
Tom knew Mary wasn't a criminal.
I'm much stronger.
The couple has three school-aged children.
What should I explain?
Tom listened to the fire crackling.
I'm sorry I didn't trust you.
He likes me and I like him too.
I think I got my point across.
"Tom is 13, but he still believes in Santa."
She knew better than to ask such a stupid question.
Tom probably knew more than he told us.
Do you miss your wife?
He called me up from Tokyo.
"I can't tell you his name, but I can tell you where he lives."
Do you study French every day?
What are you cooking?
I'll meet you tomorrow.
You may begin.
Tom changed Mary's life.
We have supper at six every evening.
I speak French a little.
Can you smell it?
I'll call again later.
I know you had no choice.
The refrigerator door was open.
I need you to tell me the truth.
The boss isn't going to fire you.
They live next door.
Does Tom know why you did that?
Were you looking for Tom?
I didn't think you were so old.
Would you be willing to send me a sample free of charge?
We played soccer yesterday.
Tom now knows why.
The suspect refused to cooperate.
There are no stars tonight.
Anything that can go wrong will.
Please hold the line.
You should have told me in advance.
I don't write poetry anymore.
He shooed the flies away.
They climbed to the top of a cliff.
I've been asked to sing a song.
"You never change, do you?"
Don't worry. I'll help you.
Tom let the bird out of its cage.
Who's going to tell Tom?
She has a very enviable position.
What does she have?
The competition has become fierce.
Tom is afraid to leave.
All Tom does is watch TV.
Are you going to wait?
Tom doesn't know the first thing about bowling.
He is the father of two children.
We didn't expect you to be here.
Do you want me to leave the light on?
Tom has gone completely mad.
Give me the sword.
When are we going to tell Tom?
My parents discouraged me from traveling.
What do you suggest?
I'm not hungry yet.
"I was happy, wasn't I?"
I was born on a farm.
The police officer asked me what my name was.
Tom held up three fingers.
The food didn't taste very good.
Did you do your homework?
What's your favorite hotel in Boston?
All the money was spent on clothes.
Did you question Tom?
There's no need to lie.
Tom always sleeps on the floor.
You're very dirty.
Open your books to page 30.
Tell them what I told you.
The boy ran away when he saw me.
Grab as much as you need.
Was it fun?
Tom and Mary are kissing.
Did you think I'd change my mind?
I didn't know that you were a French teacher.
"If you tell me the truth, I'll forgive you."
There's nothing worth watching on TV today.
"Tom warned Mary that John was nothing but trouble. However, she ignored his warning."
You will soon be convinced I am right.
I spoke slowly so that they could understand me.
I just can't find the time.
I'd love to meet you.
"Tom wanted to win, but he couldn't."
How much do teachers make?
Tom does nothing but eat and sleep.
"Very well, we'll make allowance in your case."
We were looking for Tom.
See below.
There's one more.
Tom is the only boy in the room.
I'm moving across the country.
I don't want to go there alone.
That's exactly what we're planning to do.
"In Japan, it's now 3:00 a.m."
I had no idea Tom would do that.
I wish I hadn't played golf with Tom.
"I'm being paranoid, aren't I?"
You might have heard of it.
Tom is definitely not stupid. He's just lazy.
We took a taxi so we wouldn't be late.
Tom sacrificed his life for us.
My advice to you is to leave immediately.
I won't forget that day.
We still want to help.
Tom wanted to get out of the car and walk.
It's hard to surprise you.
Tom carried Mary to safety.
We're lucky Tom isn't here.
I'd think about it.
I wish I could use magic.
Tom had no right to say that.
Don't you see what it means?
Wait until tomorrow morning.
Tom isn't crying now.
He described exactly what happened.
I wanted Tom to drive me to the airport.
Don't call Tom now.
Tom usually drives slightly over the speed limit.
Thanks for doing the dishes.
Tom is a hopeless romantic.
Is it true you got married?
Is your left leg still hurting?
I don't think I know anybody here.
Japan does a lot of trade with Britain.
Tom is prone to mood swings.
He doesn't have any knowledge about American democracy.
I think that Tom will cry.
He did his best.
Where's your grandson?
Tom heard a cry for help.
Where's your shirt?
Should I tell Tom the truth?
I'd like to talk to Tom again.
I'm sleepy.
Tom burned Mary's picture.
We leave tomorrow afternoon.
We've got to get you to the hospital.
I love to swim.
I went to the post office yesterday.
Be brave.
Tom began to laugh hysterically.
You're delirious.
Tomorrow is payday.
Ants and giraffes are distant relatives.
Why can't Tom eat now?
Tom knows that I can't speak French.
I got married 8 years ago.
I'm being serious.
Tom was waiting for Mary outside the restaurant.
Would you be fired if you did that?
It would be sad if that happened again.
I'm taking a week off.
I knew you'd like doing that.
The soldiers are wearing iron helmets.
I visited Boston with Tom.
Don't deceive yourself.
That which is easily acquired is easily lost.
What makes you think Tom was the one who did it?
We need your help finding Tom.
Come in.
I'd have waited for you.
"Tom tried to kiss me, but I didn't let him."
Tom worked for me for three years.
Tom can speak French and English.
"What do you do, exactly?"
We elected Tom chairperson.
You're beginning to worry me.
"I don't hate you, Tom."
His next two books were novels.
What job experience do you have?
What about you?
What are you going to do here?
I've been waiting for years.
I'll tell Tom we'll pick him up.
Did you talk with your husband?
Her hair style makes her look younger than her age.
I'd get in trouble if I did that.
Be careful with it.
I don't think that Tom knows if Mary will come or not.
How did you come up with such a good idea?
Tom angrily shoved Mary away.
You must return the book to him.
Tom hates it when Mary asks him to explain the same thing more than once.
She stopped smoking.
Will you come or not?
The grapes are so sour that I can't eat them.
I'm afraid you have the wrong number.
I told Tom what the problem was.
Do you know how they knew?
How did you know we were at Tom's house?
When do you study?
I knew you were OK.
Tom could have paid for Mary's ticket if he'd known she didn't have enough money.
Sweet dreams!
I've forgotten Tom's wife's name.
I made him carry the briefcase.
Life is expensive.
Does Tom have a fever?
Tom's parents were teachers.
"I've come this far, so I'll keep going."
I get up early in the morning.
Do you have grandchildren?
I don't think married people should have secrets from each other.
Let's be silent.
"She was sick, so she couldn't come."
I like mahjong.
I've already told Tom what happened.
I obeyed the rules.
Our house burned down.
Didn't I tell you to close the door?
Have you ever written a letter to Tom?
Tom is putting on weight.
Tom will study French.
"One mind is good, but two are better."
Unbelievable!
Tom invited me to the party.
Tom stood up and headed for the bathroom.
He was very poor.
What else do we need to buy?
Keep it to yourself.
Would that make a difference?
I'm sorry I said that.
I didn't think that this would happen again.
I hope that I don't get kicked out of school.
I'm sometimes a bit absent-minded.
Tom said that he didn't know you.
Don't make fun of him.
You can use English at most hotels around the world.
Everybody didn't go to bed.
Call me if you find it.
You and I both know what happened.
Do you know how busy I've been?
Don't worry. I'll come up with something.
There were no slaves in the West.
Have you ever eaten anything that made you hallucinate?
Tom told me he knew who did that.
Tom goes to Boston every summer.
Are you reading an interesting book?
Tom doesn't know what I know.
I thought Tom was funny.
Have you ever smoked?
Do you know Tom well?
He is a famous composer.
I don't know how Tom found out.
I don't trust anyone.
That's an old trick.
Neither of us did that.
She smiled at him.
Tom thinks Mary will want to do that.
You can have the rest.
I wonder whether Tom was planning to do that.
"It cost me 3,000 yen to buy the record."
I'm watching a documentary.
Tom was the first one to get here today.
Do you want me to tell Tom that we won't do it?
It wouldn't take so much time for me to do that.
I might need to stay in Australia until October 20th.
All is fair in love and war.
You shouldn't have voted for me.
I have a friend who loves me.
"The differences were minor, so I ignored them."
Am I supposed to answer that question now?
The river overflowed because of the heavy rain.
I'm going to go get some milk.
I am not leaving you.
You're a good person.
This is the third longest river in the world.
Was that French you were just speaking?
Who was here this morning?
Is Tom afraid?
This is acceptable.
Can you believe this is really happening?
My great-grandmother was a dressmaker.
I'll follow you anywhere.
I thought I told you not to come.
Tom plays the guitar almost as well as Mary does.
Can you give this to Tom?
"If there are problems, call me."
Tom put off his trip to Australia.
I need your car.
Do you want to stop?
What's it called?
You must leave.
Think about the ones you love.
They discussed the problem.
I suspect Tom didn't enjoy doing that.
Does your arm hurt?
There's no excuse for his delay.
I don't have to call anybody.
Would you like to walk to the station with me?
I had to get that off my chest.
I'm scared of Tom's dog.
She makes a good living.
I didn't make much money last year.
Did you have anything to do with this?
"Fortunately, Tom recovered."
Tom stood up slowly.
The compromise was accepted.
"You know you don't have to do this, Tom."
Tom took a sip of his milk.
We supported each other.
I don't think Tom tried hard enough.
Tom hasn't forgiven anybody.
We're going to be OK.
I don't know why Tom was fired.
Keep in touch!
Tom pulled the darts out of the board.
"Give that back to me, please."
Tom handed Mary his phone.
I'm not very good at chess.
Aren't you growing tired of this?
Tom invited you to dinner.
Everyone knows it's true.
You look fabulous.
"You remember Tom, don't you?"
Where's the nearest subway station?
I can hardly hear you.
I can help you now.
I have no choice but to do that.
How well do you know your neighbors?
Tom bought a house in our neighborhood.
This isn't my bag.
People are rich here.
I planted an apple tree in my yard.
I'm retiring in October.
I want a microscope.
We don't have another choice.
Why are you late to class?
Tom baked three pies.
Tom said he saw Mary get into John's car.
I can't log in to my account.
You're not the only woman here.
Tom rarely makes mistakes.
You didn't keep your word.
It's not a computer problem.
Tom knows the truth.
That's none of your business.
Tom tried to persuade me to sing.
We did that at school.
I want answers to all of my questions.
Why do they do that?
I wish I hadn't bought this car.
I joined the army.
Please explain to me how you did that.
The top of the mountain is always covered with snow.
I can't play chess.
I knew you were going to do that.
Tom showed Mary a few coins.
Tom said he liked rain.
Get out of there.
Tom is more scared of you than you are of him.
I already know what you want.
Are you waiting for someone?
I've checked everywhere.
I thought you said Tom wasn't here.
Why did you lend Tom so much money?
It is a very difficult job for us.
Thanks for calling.
Present your argument.
I think it's dangerous to swim in that river.
Tom translated the book from French into English.
The soldiers were sent back to their base.
There is a lot of work to do.
I just want to go back.
I watched you.
He wanted to please the crowd.
Bring me the key.
What actually happened?
Tom doesn't have to tell me about what happened if he doesn't want to.
I can't remember where Tom was born.
Did you sleep well?
What's next on the schedule?
Tom says he won't study French.
They say that he's very rich.
Where's Tom hiding?
Don't be so condescending.
It's an excellent solution.
I'll find you another table.
I don't know all the details yet.
I don't want you to see me naked.
Get your things together.
Is Tom really leaving?
I won't need a gun.
We must finish this job tonight.
We've run out of beer.
I don't know how long it'll last.
I forgot to tell you how to do that.
Where's my umbrella?
The rest doesn't matter.
Tom needs to be punished for doing that.
I wonder how much it costs.
Tom said that he loved animals.
They must be punished.
I cannot stop her.
Have you ever written a letter to Santa?
They're drunk.
They're waiting for you.
Your coat is very beautiful.
I'm used to this kind of thing happening.
You're hiding something from me.
I don't know how to begin.
"You're up to something, aren't you?"
Everyone believed you.
They were glad to see me.
I've been to Australia once.
She asked me what had become of him.
He's very timid.
Won't you have some coffee?
"Do you want any help, Tom?"
It's only a small house but it meets my needs perfectly.
"I want to get married, but not to Mary."
I have a ten-year old son.
I didn't know who I was speaking to.
She is always at the bottom of the class.
"Here, put these gloves on."
I'm adventurous.
I don't want to be disturbed.
I can play the piano after a fashion.
I must resist.
Why did you buy this car?
Tom killed the mouse with a stick.
I like this much better.
How old is your daughter?
You were crossed off the list.
I didn't expect this from you.
We want you to take it.
I don't earn that much.
Tom and Mary aren't home yet.
I wish I had a camera.
Tom didn't notice that his fly was open.
There was no time to think.
I'm not going either.
My children are in school.
"Seen from the sky, the river looked like a huge snake."
I don't think that anybody was here yesterday.
Do you happen to have matches?
Does Tom talk about us?
Roll the dice.
This heat is suffocating.
Let's just talk about you.
There's a cat on the table.
Show it to Tom.
Thank you very much for your invitation.
I don't like the way Tom looks at me.
Tom weighs around 300 pounds.
I have no money to pay for the bus.
We have lots of time.
I know that Tom was born in Boston.
Tom never forgave me.
"Tom tried the knob, but the door was locked."
She tried to look much younger than she really was.
Tom didn't bring what I asked for.
Tom was very kind to everyone.
I'm glad I went.
I won't let Tom escape.
I looked around for Tom.
We misjudged you.
Tom looked like he was going to start crying again.
We accept your challenge.
"So, what did you want to talk about?"
Tom wanted to go to Boston with us.
Try to keep up your spirits.
Please smile.
Nothing is achieved without effort.
I never regretted doing that.
Get changed.
I take full responsibility for the action.
I was hoping I'd see you again.
Tom works in a bookshop.
Aren't you going to ask Tom?
This one is clean.
Did you know Tom was in Boston?
The clown fell down on purpose.
I'm not going.
This rose is very beautiful.
I'll give you everything you need.
I think that you should do that today.
You've got a really big mouth.
Tom answered.
Tom had a lot of time to think about the problem.
You've kept your promise.
That's just common sense.
Tom knew what he had to do.
"It's one thing to make plans, but quite another to carry them out."
The hotel is located deep in the mountains.
I did a lot today.
I don't want to learn French or English.
It's been my dream since I was a little girl.
I prefer tea to coffee.
I felt a lot better.
Were you following me?
You won't get rid of me so easily.
You are to blame for the accident.
I have a bad headache today.
Tom chose a table near the window.
Tom never bought anything.
The actor played the part with feeling.
Your vote matters.
I don't often drink tequila.
They were naive.
Tom heard the doorbell ring.
It was very romantic.
You should call Tom as soon as possible.
I don't know if we can count on that.
I'm not flexible enough to sit in the lotus position.
How can I update this software?
"No matter what happens, I am prepared."
Money is tight right now.
Did you think I'd really drink that?
Tom could do this.
We've been doing that for three years.
Tom is drunk again.
I saw something very bright fly across the night sky.
She asked him how to turn on the machine.
You need to make a decision.
Tom wouldn't complain.
I was very nervous as the plane took off.
I intend to help you.
The teacher asked us a few questions.
I've spent so many years as chairman that I feel it's time I stepped down.
It seems that she was ill.
You will gain nothing from doing that.
Did I show you this?
Was my letter sent?
I've done that at least a hundred times.
We want to go.
Tom has a skeleton key.
Tom was killed with a crowbar.
I want to thank everyone who helped me do this.
A soccer team consists of eleven players.
It's over now.
It's okay.
Tom is extinguishing the fire.
That wasn't enough.
I wasn't busy last week.
It almost scared me not to see you online for a whole day.
You're not going to die here.
I have a book about fishing.
Imagine yourself having already accomplished that.
I don't really feel like laughing.
Why did you leave?
Stay here with Tom.
I hope Tom is awake.
I want some fruit.
I know that you won't be in Boston next week.
Never again will I make that mistake.
Tom told me about everything that he'd seen.
It looks like they are at it again.
What's this medicine?
I don't think Tom is homesick.
Tom got married three weeks ago.
I don't have a telephone.
Don't come.
I wish I could change that.
"You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink."
Did someone die?
Were you listening?
Tom died three weeks ago in Boston.
"Natto smells awful, but tastes delicious."
I wouldn't like being a judge.
It is regrettable that you did not start earlier.
Do what you want.
I was able to swim across the river.
I'll relay your message to Tom.
There is a bank in front of the station.
I'd like you to translate this into French.
It was really horrible.
Why don't you stay for lunch?
They're definitely more than just friends.
Tom said he saw Mary in the park.
Do you want Tom to wait?
"I wasn't at school, because I was sick."
My boss is from Australia.
I think that won't happen.
Is there any space for my luggage?
I told Tom we'd help Mary.
Do you know who conquered Mt. Everest first?
He doesn't know who built those houses.
A truck ran over our dog.
Do you want me to open the windows?
Everyone said that I was wrong.
Tom is Mary's father.
Is there something you wanted to tell me?
You just made a very big mistake.
I'm afraid you don't have any choice.
You said you'd get something to eat.
You need to talk to Tom.
I'll have to do it myself.
I need a piece of wood about three inches thick.
We'll have to finish this later.
Could I get another piece of pie?
Fire is very dangerous.
I can't tell you yet.
"Written by hand, the letter was not very easy to read."
I wish that you hadn't told me that.
I used to go skiing in the winter.
She has no brothers.
The faucet in the bathroom's out of order.
I painted the gate blue.
Do you have a printer?
Tom isn't going to catch us.
Why does no one believe me?
The old woman got off the bus.
I don't think that anything's going to change.
I didn't need Tom's help.
I don't remember putting it there.
I opened the cages.
I'm the one who called you guys.
Tom said he would go to Boston.
I told Tom to wait in the car.
It's a compliment.
I wasn't sick then.
Tom emerged from his slumber.
When's the wedding?
What made Tom leave?
Tom has more money than he needs.
I didn't want you to read that.
She stirred the soup with a spoon.
She plays tennis after school.
All we want is for you to be happy.
We were all so proud of you.
Don't be so hard on Tom. He meant well.
Tom is blind in one eye.
"I had a headache, so I went to bed early."
A man began to follow Tom.
Would you calm down?
Tom pulled Mary into the kitchen.
Tom competes in ski races.
The crocodile is a protected species.
Do you often listen to audiobooks?
Many people don't know that antibiotics are ineffective against viral diseases.
Did you sleep all day?
"This way please, Tom."
I wish Tom had done it.
I'm almost thirty.
Let's go and find Tom.
They are very kind.
Did anybody follow you?
"If Tom had been here, he'd have helped us."
Tom doesn't get along with his neighbors.
Hold this.
May I eat that orange?
Have you ever played poker?
It wasn't me who told Tom that.
It's under the table.
You're here.
Watch out! He's coming right at you!
I don't see any damage.
This wasn't my idea.
Tom sings in the church choir.
I know you work hard.
"Tom is a decent, law-abiding citizen."
I'll need a few minutes.
The tea set isn't complete.
I knew you wouldn't be fired.
We're Facebook friends.
How much more money does Tom need?
Take your raincoat in case it rains.
Tom can't make me sing.
How do you take your coffee?
You can't stay here.
You're braver than me.
I think I've got it.
Tom's French is excellent.
Have you seen Tom this morning?
Tell me what the matter is.
How long does it last?
Are you sure that's what you want?
Which one of you two is in charge?
We weren't given food or water.
Tom didn't want Mary to suffer.
Who wrote this article?
One of my brothers lives in Australia.
Tom has stayed at my house several times.
These two brothers resemble each other.
I'm worried about them.
I learned a lot about Greek culture.
Are all swans white?
I'm glad that you succeeded.
She can't swim.
You know enough.
Do you find French difficult?
I've seen a few.
This tea is very hot.
I hear you.
Tom admired Mary for her bravery.
Your ideas are different from mine.
Do you think Tom will let you win?
I need to lie down.
There are a lot of parks in London.
It cost three thousand dollars exactly.
This bread was baked this morning.
The cat is eating.
You're the only one who's seen Tom.
I have enough problems of my own without having to worry about yours.
I don't want to talk to you ever again.
I got something from Tom.
You're such a liar.
Will you have a cup of coffee?
He still hasn't answered my letter.
"Some of them are teachers, and some are engineers."
We were told not to cross this line.
Does anybody really care?
We have bills that need to be paid.
Maybe Tom wasn't wrong.
I'm not going to ask you to do that.
Can we provide assistance?
You've got no choice.
Where did you eat?
What's the meaning of that?
Can I sleep on your couch?
She is mad at you.
I doubt you can do that.
Tell me what I have to do.
I'm free every day but Monday.
I'd like to know the reason.
This is my project.
We aren't ready.
Please leave me alone.
Don't ever talk to me like that again.
They moved here three years ago.
Tom is on the phone with Mary now.
I'll look after your dog while you're away.
You have no heart.
I can't figure out how to transfer MP3 files from my iPod back to my computer.
Tom left me.
The policemen arrested the burglar.
Tom was better.
I left you a note.
Three times three is nine.
I've burnt the toast.
There's someone with Tom.
Don't be too rough on Tom.
We aren't on the right road.
I'm blind.
Did you read the letter I sent you?
Tom held his hand out.
I'm the owner of this restaurant.
I've got a question.
There's nothing else we need to do.
May I call on you at your house tomorrow morning?
"I'm Japanese, but I don't live in Japan."
Please keep my place in line.
Tom is a bit older than Mary.
We looked at each other.
Tom is wearing John's T-shirt.
I think they've done a good job.
How many people can you see?
Tom is working at a bank.
People don't trust the government.
Follow him.
You've got to apologize.
That's only my personal opinion.
I think this is the best way to do it.
You understand me very well.
Tom wanted a million dollars.
I learned to milk a cow.
Why don't we talk about something else?
What'll we do if that happens?
I'm sure Tom doesn't want to be here.
Pack them in the box.
Please tell me where you will live.
I don't have any small change.
How do you propose to do that?
Tom has never heard Mary sing.
Have you fed the horse?
I don't want to harm you.
Tom may get fired.
We're all friends here.
Don't be so impatient.
I haven't slept well since Tom left.
He left everything to chance.
Tom and Mary hugged.
Tom did his homework.
I go to bed early.
Walk more slowly.
Let's go see a movie.
We saved the best for last.
Don't speak with your mouth full.
Tom is the first guy Mary has really been interested in since she broke up with John.
People are depending on you.
I'm sorry I was late.
I think Tom was bluffing.
He asked me about my new job.
You could help me.
Tom has the flu.
Did you say everything you wanted to say?
Tom had to go there.
I've seen it a million times.
Tom could've met you at the airport.
Let's go by train.
I appreciate all you've done for me.
Has that been scientifically proven?
My father is always poking his nose into my private life.
We've been waiting on you.
The whole world speaks English.
Tom honked at Mary.
You have a bright future.
Tom counted to ten.
I heard a loud bang.
Are you saying I smell bad?
You need to talk to Tom in person.
What should I do with Tom?
Tom is eloquent.
We forgive you.
You tried.
Tom drinks six cups of coffee a day.
I know where you were.
Isn't Tom hungry?
I've been writing letters all day long.
I am forbidden to use this telephone.
I just want to talk to you.
How did you know that I was going to say yes?
I've decided to say yes.
Do you know their address?
We tried to save Tom.
Will you give this to Tom?
How much is that computer?
Tom said he wasn't angry anymore.
Were you unhappy?
What do you think of that new restaurant?
Mary wore knee-high boots.
Take this one.
Tom didn't tell me where he lived.
Mary dreamed that one day she would meet a prince and they would get married.
Tom did that the way I told him to.
She's busy now and can't speak to you.
What's wrong with that?
It's really not that cold.
They're fighting.
We lost.
Have you taken a bath yet?
I would like to discuss a few details.
No one wanted anything to do with Tom.
Will you help me with my French homework?
I play both the trumpet and the piano.
Tom agreed immediately.
We must talk.
I seldom come here anymore.
You really should eat before you leave.
Can't anyone take Tom's place?
I have to set a good example.
He took a walk before breakfast.
"Hey, I have an idea."
I'm unprepared for this.
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?
Buckle your seatbelt.
Drop your guns!
I knew your father very well.
Try this instead.
You can't swim.
Please turn out the lights.
Is it time to eat?
That will do.
Why doesn't Tom just buy a new one?
I won't say it again.
Tom is free to leave if he wants to.
My father quickly scanned the newspaper.
I didn't know you had a cat.
I wanted Tom to stay.
People think I'm a little nuts.
The square of 5 is 25.
I need help with my luggage.
"Wouldn't you like to come with us, too?"
Do you have any idea what time Tom will come home?
It's in my pocket.
"I know we've had problems, but I think they've all been solved."
Tom stabbed Mary with a spear.
I relaxed.
What is your age?
What does Tom have in mind?
Tom began to blush.
There's been a death in his family.
Some people don't know that.
The answer to your question is very simple.
I don't think that Tom was mistaken.
Are you going to be eating that piece of pie?
Tom likes tea with cinnamon.
I don't think that I can fix this.
How much is this party going to cost?
I won't do that.
Mother has not cooked dinner yet.
I'm not afraid.
My mother cleans the room.
I can see that you're upset.
You're scaring the kids.
Tom complained about the cold.
Did you forget to buy eggs?
I'll pay you well.
It is better to have old second-hand diamonds than none at all.
I know that you're busy.
Children need more sleep than adults.
Tom never stays anywhere very long.
It's going to take Tom a couple of hours to get here.
Life will never be the same again.
Let go of me!
Tom refused to pay his bills.
The heat is terrible today.
How often do you use your phone?
Do you think Tom is going to die?
Let's let Tom leave.
I'm talking to Tom.
I have already written a letter.
Let's be honest with each other.
Let Tom do it.
I remember the first time I heard this song.
Didn't you know Tom isn't really from Boston?
I think watching TV is a waste of time.
Boston wasn't cold when I was there.
It looks like Tom is getting tired.
I'd like to help Tom prove it.
Tom worked until 2:30.
She has the same bag as you have.
Don't get mad.
He stooped down to put on his shoes.
We're always hungry.
Tom used to be nice.
My girlfriend dumped me.
I usually go to bed before ten.
I speak French fairly fluently.
I reserved my hotel room three weeks in advance.
I went home to change clothes.
I've already made up my mind.
"You're a little older than Tom, aren't you?"
How dare you speak like that to me!
Tom said it was your fault.
I'm waiting to hear from Tom.
He is accustomed to bribing anyone who gets in his way.
No one lives here.
I would like you to answer my questions.
Tom opened his eyes and saw Mary.
Tom doesn't look pleased.
Tom said that Mary was eating.
You've got to tell me what's going on.
Are you sure Tom isn't busy?
I didn't know that Tom was upset.
We both need more time.
Tom walk his dogs at least three times a day.
He was killed instantly.
The whole class passed the exam.
"Despite the concerns, the weather was magnificent."
We are looking for a house with a garage.
"How would you like your coffee, black or with cream?"
Tom has lost his interest in studying French.
Tom got an A in French.
Are you afraid of silence?
I used to live not far from here.
"I'm ready now, Tom."
Tom won't let Mary go anywhere.
Tom could've killed you if he'd wanted to.
Tom wasn't planning to go.
I dedicate this song to Tom.
Your brother will not buy it.
Do you understand me?
Tom Jackson is a very influential man.
Tom doesn't do drugs.
Can you keep an eye on Tom?
Let's say you're right.
We're thinking of moving back to Boston.
Tom jumped up from his chair.
What made you come here so early?
I'm looking forward to that.
Do we all have to do that?
I'm not a weirdo.
What are you telling me for?
Tom didn't have to buy anything.
Why did you buy this car?
I'd prefer to speak to you in private.
She has a good heart.
Is Tom available?
This is not for you.
Tom wants to eat some ice cream.
We're working hard.
We're proud of our team.
Tom's impossible.
Take cover!
Police cordoned off the area and carried out a thorough search for the fugitive.
Look at this picture.
"Turn it off, Tom."
I look after Tom.
I'm planning on doing that tomorrow.
More than one million tons of coal are mined each day in Australia.
I was following you.
I don't know everybody.
Could you take a picture of me?
It's a stupid tradition.
I need to know who'll be coming.
Can we ask you a couple of questions?
When does your plane depart?
I'm afraid it's not a good idea.
Tom told me that Mary had a new boyfriend.
Tom won't bother you anymore.
Tom gave a vague answer.
You've got it all wrong.
My house is on your left as you go up the street towards the church.
Tom said that Mary was tired.
What are you going to do today?
Tom has written several books.
Mary got her ears pierced.
I've saved a lot of money.
Tom was shocked.
I called Tom's parents.
Come and look.
Your grandmother is a charming lady.
Tom said he knew you.
Tom is a timid boy.
Tom looked up at Mary.
We don't have any other choice.
The train station is nearby.
"If Tom is going to be there, I won't go."
People are not always what they seem.
You'll find something.
I didn't have much money.
Tom enjoyed Mary's company.
It's going to break.
Tom still hasn't paid me.
I am sorry that I could not go with her.
Did you know Tom was writing a novel?
I went up to the 5th floor in an elevator.
I want to introduce you to Tom.
I wonder if what I wrote was correct.
All I can do at the moment is wait.
Tom and Mary love their children.
We really don't have time.
Tom should've apologized to Mary.
That helped a lot.
Tom didn't seem to know who we were.
I don't know if Tom is coming or not.
I wasn't prepared for it.
Only 5 million people live in Norway.
I wonder why Tom isn't busy.
We'd like to speak with Tom.
I haven't done that in a long time.
I told Tom that I was cold.
They usually say that women live longer than men.
We'll explain later.
I live on a farm.
I'm sure Tom will love your present.
I thought Tom had already left.
I haven't been to the supermarket in a long time.
"Back in those days, I loved to play checkers."
Is this made in Switzerland?
We saw it happen.
I didn't know that you used to work here.
"Excuse me, do you work here?"
Are you free tomorrow?
Nothing's going to happen.
Do you believe Tom?
Tom told me he wants to go with us.
Tom almost died today.
He bit off more than he could chew.
We didn't sing.
Didn't you bring anything?
Did you know that that would happen?
I need my privacy.
Tom asked Mary questions.
What is in the desk?
"Tom gave the key to me, but I lost it."
Tom knew he was under investigation.
Tom forgot to do something.
I bought myself a bottle of wine.
Lions and tigers are called big cats.
I think you're reliable.
He is leaving in three days.
Here's a pillow you can use.
That's the most beautiful gift I've ever received.
We'll do the same for you.
We're trying to find out why.
Tom didn't want to be seen with Mary.
You can rest.
Tom is loved by everybody.
All you do is complain.
I've finished translating the report.
I have been here for two years.
Cut it with a knife.
Maybe you did do that wrong.
Tom is a religious man.
The result of the game is doubtful.
The food was so good that I ate too much.
I have plans with Tom tonight.
Put the gun down.
We should be safe now.
"Oh, don't bother."
Tom is unlikely to go with us next weekend.
Return to the ship immediately.
"I miss you, Tom."
I don't think Tom knows where Mary learned how to drive.
Ask him for advice.
I don't know yet what I want to do.
How long has this box been here?
I'm always on your side.
Have you known her since 1990?
I really didn't mean to hurt you.
This book is mine.
Tom caught many fish.
Travel broadens one's horizons.
Tom was bitten by a stray dog.
It was lunchtime.
I don't remember doing it.
What don't you understand?
Why should I give money to you?
Tom won't be staying for dinner.
I didn't even notice you were there.
Let's not paint too pretty a picture.
Get serious!
Tom was very miserable.
"It's very hot, isn't it?"
I'm bored and I have nothing to do.
I don't think Tom knows that I love you.
I'm not in a very good mood.
You must stop.
Let's do the math.
People do stupid things sometimes.
Tom was wearing an old hat.
"I haven't met him in person, but I know of him."
You'll get better.
I get by.
You're always singing.
We became close friends.
Why didn't you tell me before?
I'll take you to the bus stop.
I've already told you this ten times.
It wasn't important to me.
How much do you owe me?
How many books have you read so far this summer?
Turn down the volume.
Tom has a 3-year-old brother.
Theory and practice should go hand in hand.
I don't have much desire for wealth.
Tom helped me wash my car.
Drink something.
Are you still playing the guitar?
"If your answer is correct, it follows that mine is wrong."
Tom advised Mary not to go there by herself.
I need to buy a muzzle for my dog.
She is playing with her friends.
I have a fever.
I don't think Tom can help you now.
I'm not saying it's Tom's fault.
I advised Tom not to eat the shrimp.
Do you have any Japanese beer?
I'm really old.
They elected him President of the USA.
I am thinking of going abroad.
Don't tell my mother.
I don't think that Tom is ever going to get married.
Can you distinguish silver from tin?
Enter the room.
How do I explain this?
Do any of you have a pencil?
I thought my head was going to explode.
Their work seems good to me.
Why did you give Tom that?
"She isn't my sister, she's my wife."
I don't understand what you are talking about.
Tom was fussy.
Why did you name your son Tom?
Is that Tom's daughter?
The Republican candidate won the election.
I've done everything that you've asked me to do.
Tom was also having fun.
Your sister is attractive.
I just can't do this anymore.
I work on Mondays.
Tom turned back.
Can I say this one last time?
I'm used to that.
Do you think Tom is awake?
I am convinced that things will change for the better.
I want them to like you.
Tom never locks his door.
"Bring me the phone, Tom."
That's an interesting idea.
I thought you said that Tom needed more time.
Do you and Tom stay in touch?
I don't think that it's a good idea.
Tom likes games.
It's no use waiting for him to come.
What do you expect?
Is all of that necessary?
Tom has a trash compactor.
Put on your gloves.
We were outnumbered.
They fell asleep in each other's arms.
There is a little milk in the bottle.
What does Tom think he's doing?
Tom rested.
I thought you were a nurse.
Is that what you're going to tell Tom?
Bonds were issued to finance a war.
"The bill, please."
I'm just a freshman.
Tom is one of Boston's best lawyers.
You left your keys in the door.
Tom doesn't smoke or drink.
Hunger compelled the boy to steal money from the cash register.
Leave tomorrow.
Black absorbs light.
The sailors saw land.
Tom is trying to earn enough money to buy a new trumpet.
I shouldn't have asked Tom to help.
I don't think everyone knows what to do.
We just want to be together.
The weather is very cold in Istanbul.
Have you been a bad boy?
Tom loves both his parents.
Can you explain what this means?
"Well, what did you find out?"
I'd feel the same way if I were in your shoes.
English has become my favorite subject.
I want to tell you something important.
Nobody was listening to the speech.
Tom isn't timid.
I think Tom will be able to help Mary do that.
I can't answer you now.
"Study hard, or you'll fail the exam."
Do you want us to wait?
I didn't like it in Australia.
I think you'll need a loan.
This is broken.
It looks like a storm is coming.
Why does Tom do that that way?
Tom got fired from his job.
When did you ask Tom?
We've hired Tom.
The post office is closed.
Tom has decided to move to Boston.
Don't you like cats?
The police officer advised us to leave.
Sometimes miracles still happen.
Tom brushed his hair.
I needed a bath.
Where would you like to go first?
I didn't like any of these books.
I arrived safe and sound this morning.
You'll be happy.
Tom tried not to be late.
He will also go.
Tom doesn't know what Mary wants him to do.
You never trusted me.
Where do you think I should go?
I think you know why.
Tom would be proud of you.
Tom is still under surveillance.
She likes running.
Let him go.
Tom won't leave me alone.
The newspaper publishes the most important facts.
We'll go now if you're ready.
I should've told Tom no.
Tom didn't go after all.
A pine stands in front of his house.
I leaned out of the window.
I wanted to make sure you were here.
It has nothing to do with luck.
Tom puts gas in his car twice a week.
Didn't you know that Tom had relatives in Australia?
I've got a job in Australia.
That's how the pros do it.
What's the square root of 100?
This chair is made of wood.
I had difficulty finding Tom's house.
Did you get lost?
I'll pick you up at 2:30.
I wrote it down on a napkin.
Tell me about your hobbies.
I'm too tired to talk.
"Well, that's a difficult question."
Do you feel sick?
Don't tell Tom I'm here.
Why doesn't Tom agree with you?
I should've asked Tom for permission.
We have only three days.
Why does Tom hate Mary so much?
I'm sure Tom will forgive you.
I want you to grow up.
She is my girlfriend.
Tom isn't very old.
My Internet connection isn't fast enough.
Do something else.
Tom can't get up.
I know what Tom is looking at.
"After the earthquake, the land value in this area went down a lot."
I'm going to be your French teacher next year.
The work must be done by Tom.
I don't think that Tom knows the truth yet.
I had never seen a giraffe till I visited the zoo.
We'll be back at 2:30.
This box contains apples.
Did you understand what Tom said in French?
Haven't I told you not to call me Tom?
I'll die if you don't tell me.
Tom watched silently.
Can you squeeze me in?
Tom doesn't know the first thing about programming.
Do you know who that is?
I'm a little thirsty myself.
Do you know where he went?
You should sleep.
He looked young.
"Who are you looking for, Tom?"
The police think it's a suicide.
A pound is a unit of weight.
He was ashamed of his tears.
Do you still not understand what's going on?
I'm reserved.
I don't think that Tom has the courage to do that.
Tom opened the door and the dog ran out.
Tom did send Mary flowers once.
Tom was afraid to go back home.
Nobody speaks French here.
He's still sick in bed.
Tom is reading.
"If you ever do anything to hurt Tom, I'll kill you."
I'll call if I learn anything.
Tom wasn't the best.
Thank God that nobody was hurt.
Tom checked his mailbox.
I am very reserved.
Tom called us.
Tom is going to fail.
Tom says that Mary smiled at him.
Tom and Mary have always been very good friends.
You'll like it.
He threw a stone into the pond.
I know that I may die soon.
She was pleased with the gift.
This shirt doesn't fit me anymore.
I usually sit in the back.
I'd like to know what you think.
Have you really already found a new job?
Let's leave as soon as possible.
I'm not going to tell you why I did that.
I found some old coins in my backyard.
Where's Tom working now?
The snow will all be gone within a few days.
I tried to remain calm.
We're going to do that next spring.
Tom said that he felt dizzy.
Tom didn't seem to mind waiting for Mary.
"Actually, you're right."
Tom and Mary participated in the cultural exchange program.
Tom punished his children for what they did.
Didn't you know Tom isn't really from Boston?
Tom is still here.
I arrived there before Tom did.
Tom showed me his collection of old coins.
I'm leaving you tomorrow.
We're ready now.
Please tell us what to do next.
Do you want to play a game?
Tom was frisked by the police officer.
One day you'll thank me.
I still want to hear Tom's opinion.
They're doctors.
You two look like you're in love.
His penmanship is horrible.
This is Tom's pen.
I told Tom why I had to do that.
I know that you'll forgive me.
God is everywhere.
Tom is just over thirty years old.
Does Tom know where the others are?
My car doesn't always start.
We'll have plenty of time later.
Tom knew exactly where to go.
I wrote Tom a letter in French.
Tom has problems at school.
He can talk to spirits.
I thought you wanted to get married.
Did you think I wouldn't tell Tom?
I'll do everything that I can to help.
How much money do you have on you right now?
That's an insult.
Ask Tom.
I'm so hungry.
Tom is a high school senior.
Let me pay for the dinner.
I'm glad you came over.
I asked Tom where he lived.
Are you still playing the guitar?
"In case of emergency, call 119."
Which subject do you like the most?
Is that all you want to know?
He read for more than two and a half hours.
Tom asked me where my father was.
Can you teach me how to swim?
It's about thirty minutes from here on foot.
Please come by 2:30.
I still can't speak French.
He is content with his present state.
"If you want me to go, I'll go."
It's snowing now in Boston.
Have you already forgotten me?
Don't change your mind.
I haven't found my keys yet.
I'll tell you what I want to do.
I'd like to learn French.
Tom will drive us to the beach.
He spoke to the teacher.
I have already read today's paper.
"You were alone at that time, weren't you?"
You're annoying.
He pushed me gently.
"When Tom was eighteen, he decided he wanted to become a soldier."
She will never have a second chance to visit Europe.
Didn't you know Tom was in Australia last week?
I asked Tom to tell you I wasn't coming.
Tom sat down at one of the tables.
I didn't want to make a scene in front of everyone.
They'll do it.
I don't like hot food.
I'll play with you.
I need this to round out my collection.
Are you still sleepy?
Do you know what that is?
This is our fault.
No one is there.
The Eiffel Tower is very tall.
Tom and Mary got back together.
Tom won't help you.
He introduced his sister to me.
Please give me an ashtray.
We have to put off making a final decision until next week.
That's my favorite.
Tom didn't know what time he was supposed to be there.
I was the last one to fall asleep.
I don't think Tom knows why you didn't do that.
What are you thinking about?
Tom has found another way to make money.
Tom didn't move.
"By the way, I saw him yesterday."
How much is this vacation going to cost us?
Did you tell Tom he could go see Mary tonight?
He saw a pretty girl.
Did you really swim for three hours yesterday?
I'd like to talk to you when you have some free time.
I've already read all of those books.
I know it's not fair.
It's unlikely Tom will win.
Do you have any oranges?
Tom takes his dog for a walk every morning.
It took several months to shoot that film.
I need a new laptop.
Do you do that every day?
Let's go to the hospital.
You look content.
You were asleep at your post.

"It's your decision, Tom."
Would you like me to stop?
Tom put on a black wig.
He looks like a horse.
I don't know who to ask for advice.
Who else knows about it?
What makes you smile?
The old man is very kind.
Pay close attention to every detail.
"He looks old, but he hasn't reached 30 yet."
This song makes me cry every time I listen to it.
No words can relieve her deep sorrow.
What's Tom planning?
Can we still be friends?

What are we going to do if that happens?
Kids like ice cream.
You can't believe everything you read in the paper.
I was thinking about getting married.
Are you sure that Tom is here?
He teaches us history.
It's not so little.
I want you to tell me how to do this.
We've had a lot of rain this month.
Tom knows that he's dying.
I am sure I saw her two years ago.
"There was something I needed to get at the supermarket, but I forgot to pick it up."

I tried to write him.
Can you stop calling me that?
I can no longer trust Tom.
Don't trust him.
I am never at home on Sundays.
This mail will be delivered tomorrow.
She choked him with her bare hands.
"Tom said that, not me."
"It was not what he said, but the way he said it that made me suspicious."
I thought that you said you didn't want to do that.
Tom may go wherever he wants.
I recommend you to go by train.
I demand an explanation.
How about that!

I really ought to go.
Did you know Mary and Alice were Tom's sisters?
I just did my job.
Tom won't be able to survive on his own.
Tom and I know each other quite well.
Why don't you give it up?
Do you use a deodorant?
I know you're not planning on staying here for a long time.
I don't like Australia.
Tom was secretly in love with Mary.
Can you help us?
It was dark green.
You have to pay taxes.
Ninety-five percent of orphans are older than 5 years old.
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I'm not suggesting we lie to Tom.
I want to do this.
I've already told Tom what I want to do.
Can you show me around?
You know how much I hate Tom.
Didn't you know that Tom used to work in Australia?
I'll discuss it with Tom.
Tom thinks Mary is here.
I hate homework.
We followed Tom.
Tom did a bad job.
I really need to go.
"May I call you tonight? ""Sure."""
You've been told.
I didn't have much time.
What are you afraid of now?
The party was fun.
Tom certainly knew about the problem.
Troops inside the walls were well protected.
You're back early.
"Tom wanted to ask Mary to go out with him, but he didn't have the courage to."
Couldn't Tom help?
I wouldn't want you to get the wrong impression about me.
I'm OK.
I'll draw a map for you.
Why is he here?
Stop being such a snob.
I hear that you kissed my girlfriend.
I don't have time to argue.
Neither Tom nor Mary has spoken to me.
Aren't you dressed yet?
Come anytime you like.
Tom and Mary are John's parents.
Don't forget your student ID.
I knew you'd say that.
How much money do you have with you right now?
Tom knew where Mary wanted to spend her summer vacation.
"At first, I mistook him for your brother."
It is very hot here in the summer.
Tom told Mary not to go there by herself.
I owe him 100 yen.
Your parents must be so proud of you.
I didn't do this alone.
Keep a bucket of water nearby.
I'll do everything I can to help you.
What do you think about Tom?
Are you dating anybody?
Which information are you talking about?
Japan trades with lots of countries in the world.
I'll never forgive you if you do that.
"If I had wings, I would fly to you."
I'm trying to change that.
Tom is facing a few serious problems.
Iron is much more useful than gold.
It's ours.
Deal with this.
Tom thought Mary knew John.
"I ordered the children to stay quiet, but they kept on making noise."
I'll get Tom.
Don't tell me you've never been to Australia.
I'm writing a book.
Tom is happy with it.
I was quite dissatisfied.
Tom gazed at Mary with love in his eyes.
My neighbors are Canadians.
We do what we want to do.
The diamond appears genuine.
I've lost my key.
I told Tom about you.
"I'm busy, so I can't go."
You'll get fired if you don't do that.
Someday your dream will come true.
I know that Tom has gone.
"Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but I forgot."
Send it to me.
I want to see Boston.
I hope that you don't catch a cold.
Was Tom in the shower?
You've got my phone.
I was confused.
Tom was special.
Tomorrow is the last day of school!
I have three options for you.
He immigrated to Brazil in search of a better life.
He was guilty of murder.
The next question is for you.
Tom is already a man.
What time did you see Tom?
Tom is the most boring person I know.
Tom knows who died.
Do you know if Tom and Mary have made up yet?
I enjoy being with my kids.
I'm sure Tom will be back tomorrow.
Tom and Mary are whispering to each other.
I've been a little busy.
I wanted to watch that movie with you.
Don't forget to wake me up tomorrow morning.
Tom threw his knife at Mary.
Tom asked me to come over.
I like that one.
I wish we could ask Tom.
Just look at him.
I've traveled many times.
Tell Tom to do the same.
Tom accused me of lying.
I've been ordered to kill you.
I read your letter yesterday.
Can't you swim at all?
I know that this doesn't really matter.
We ate a lot of ice cream.
I shouldn't have done that without your permission.
We've got trouble.
The lake is about 25 meters deep.
I had nothing to do with the accident.
I usually walk to school.
That's what I want to hear.
Pay what you can.
I'm not good at meeting people.
Tom knows that won't work.
I couldn't think of a good place to hide my money.
What would you have told Tom?
Are you alive in there?
She recovered from her long illness.
Tom thinks there's hope.
You cannot read this novel without crying.
Do you know what kind of tree this is?
This is for your own good.
I don't yet know what needs to be done.
I wasn't talking.
You can't be a blood donor.
Somebody's watching you.
I never would've said that.
I was in Boston last summer.
"Will you go, too?"
Wouldn't you like to drink some tea?
He lost all of his money at the casino.
He likes to read books.
Tom isn't old enough to drive.
You're acting like a child.
What advice did Tom give you?
This task took three hours.
I surrender.
What did Tom want to show us?
That mattress needs to be aired out.
You should help your father.
Did you know peanuts aren't really nuts?
Why are you all here?
We learn by teaching.
I knew Tom would win.
My watch gains one minute a day.
Tom drove back to Mary's house.
I know Tom may have to do that.
Why are you looking at me?
I've learned a lot about you.
Is Tom eating?
He breathed his last.
I already have a family.
Tom is despondent.
What did you tell Tom for?
I want a discount.
She won't like this.
I'm no longer married.
"You think Tom's handsome, don't you?"
Can you skate?
"Tom isn't very smart, is he?"
I knew you wouldn't listen to me.
What time is breakfast?
I didn't know Tom was Mary's uncle.
This is very serious.
The dog crawled through an opening in the fence.
This only happens in Australia.
I'm just waiting for Tom.
"You can't keep doing this, Tom."
It's something worth fighting for.
Tom inherited all of his father's property.
We had doubts.
What do bees eat?
"It's very difficult to transport them overland, but simple to do so by sea."
I'm hoping it won't happen.
Tom went to Boston to buy a painting.
There was a strong wind on that day.
Ask Tom where he lives.
Tom is grim.
"When I'm with you, I'm happy."
We have three dogs.
Hug me.
We invite you to come visit us in the summer.
Tom told Mary not to add sugar.
The crowd gathered around the speaker.
Tom says he's never been to Boston.
He's been waiting here for quite a while.
I like him.
Did you tell Tom?
I'll do that if you tell me how to.
Don't change the channel.
We didn't hear you come in.
Do you believe Tom is innocent?
Tom said that he isn't going to Mary's concert.
Our team is better than yours.
Tom and I haven't seen each other for a long time.
The policeman wrested a gun from the murderer.
"I don't know if you've noticed, but Tom seems to have fallen in love with your daughter."
I missed the two o'clock plane.
Tom left in a cab.
I'm going to get there before dark.
I knew about that a week ago.
I can't wait to go hunting with Tom.
Tom admitted that.
Let's see what's wrong with it.
Tom was first one to reach the summit.
What are Tom's true intentions?
It's not complicated.
Tell Tom to stop.
They said they were leaving.
I am going to sleep.
Tom got out of prison on October 20th.
Lincoln opposed slavery.
You have to find Tom.
"As long as you are with him, you can't be happy."
Tom knows how to cook.
We have a good heating system.
Bring me a glass of water.
Do you two know something?
You said you'd get something to eat.
Tom still didn't know what to do.
This desk is made of wood.
Are you going with Tom?
This can be fixed.
I was surprised to see you yesterday.
I really wanted to believe that.
Can anybody tell me why Tom isn't here?
"Tom, do you want us to go with you?"
I'm by myself.
I wear boxers.
The three boys looked at one another.
Tom is in the lobby of the hotel.
Why did you stop doing that?
I like driving.
You were never good at math.
We'll do that when we have time.
I know where your house is.
I'll come straight to the point. You're fired.
Tom is looking for another job.
Tom packed his things and left.
Tom told Mary he wasn't going to do that.
I will be very careful.
Tom pulled a delicious-looking pizza out of the oven.
Tom should've told Mary that he was married.
She pretended not to hear me.
Please fill up the bottle with water.
He sang while working.
Don't touch anything without asking first.
I'm reading the novel you gave me last week.
Doing that's very important.
I can't stand this pain longer.
President Monroe was a slave-owner.
This toy car runs on batteries.
Now lie still.
No one listens to me when I talk.
Finish drinking your milk.
Tom will never forget Mary.
I need to see Tom.
I'd like to hear your opinion.
Tom wanted to start a new life.
Don't take anything for granted.
Tom has been punished.
He couldn't bear to be apart from her.
Hold the vase in both hands.
Do you know how busy I've been?
Prices are high here.
The reason is obvious.
Is this hat yours?
I need to leave before Tom arrives.
I'd rather not do that anymore.
I didn't know that Tom had three cats.
Many things will be different.
I suppose that's what usually happens.
How much is this hat?
I thought you looked sad.
How many years ago did that happen?
Didn't you know Tom saw you in the park this morning?
Tom said that there are no meetings scheduled for today.
Why don't you buy a new car?
The petals floated on the surface of the water.
I'm unprejudiced.
He made a fortune in oil.
Nobody answered the phone.
I knew that Tom wanted to do that.
I think food is expensive in Japan.
Is that everything you wanted?
I told Tom that I was hungry.
I don't know where Tom lived.
Come by tomorrow.
Tom will tell Mary.
Where did you put the car key?
Is it black?
Tom arrived by car.
Are you sure you don't know Tom?
I am in favor of the proposition.
Can you explain something to me?
We're grateful to you for all your help.
Tom is going to get there before Mary.
Do you always get up this early?
Does Tom have it?
A leopard can't change its spots.
They angered me.
He has taken over his father's business.
Tom wanted to wait.
Try to go slower.
My wisdom tooth hurts.
Tom is fearless.
I want you to stay here with her.
The atomic bomb destroyed the entire city of Hiroshima.
Keep searching.
It is advisable to go by train.
The antelope ran away.
Are you going to school today?
Try not to splatter the ink.
You'd better get back to class.
Do you really think this is going to work?
Take off your coat.
The bartender threw Tom out of the bar.
Tom talked about school.
Tom has already forgotten about you.
What do you have in your bag?
How many people have died?
Don't get greedy.
I told you I don't know if Tom will tell the truth.
What was in the envelope?
I knew you would tell Tom about what we did.
I know it's impossible.
This road will lead you to the park.
I was late because of the traffic.
I thought that book was difficult to read.
You're probably sleepy.
Tom must've left.
It is necessary for you to go there.
Tom lives alone with his dog.
I tried to cheer Tom up.
Maybe they are happy.
She's going to kill me.
Don't forget to bring a pen.
Let me talk to Tom.
It wasn't so hard to do that.
Tom says he thinks Mary is beautiful.
It is an endangered species.
Do you know anything about training dogs?
Tom and I went to a movie together.
I'm the only one who survived the accident.
I fell asleep around midnight.
The Japanese pay more attention to the group or the organization than to the individual.
The body converts extra calories into fat.
I'm getting ready.
You've got to win.
I would've left early if I could've.
Tom wanted to go to college.
I assume you're referring to Tom.
"If I were you, I would accept his offer."
That was pretty selfish of Tom not to let you use the car.
You both seem afraid.
I like red wine.
"The moment I held the baby in my arms, it began to cry."
I'm not much of a swimmer.
Tom isn't who he says he is.
They had guns.
Get in the back seat.
Have you put on weight?
What do you know about it?
You must quit drinking.
I do want to go with you.
Tom spent the entire afternoon with Mary.
It was so hot that I slept with the window open.
Did you know that your door was open?
Come closer.
Tom told me a lot about Boston.
Do you want to wear my jacket?
I worked hard in order to support my family.
Have you ever heard Tom speak French?
He kept standing against a tree.
What does this have to do with us?
I said leave Tom alone.
This is difficult.
This is a good system.
It will take a little time to get used to wearing a wig.
I admitted that I didn't know how to do that.
The bus stops right in front of my house.
"I have two dogs, three cats, and six chickens."
The movie wasn't half bad.
Tom ran to get a doctor.
There's nobody else in the room.
Aren't you late?
Tom said he wanted to buy some soap.
Telling me was the right thing to do.
Who gave you permission to come here?
We know each other quite well.
Tom knows some of Mary's friends.
Do it the best you can.
I did my homework.
Tom stumbled and fell flat on his face.
Please move this stone from here to there.
I didn't know that Tom understood French.
You didn't invite me.
We were both wrong.
We've got a million things to do.
I've already paid for the first lesson.
Tom is Mary's younger brother.
Almost nobody thinks we're sisters.
I hope you're not planning to do that today.
Tom got out in front of the library and waited while Mary went to park the car.
We can't protect you.
What are you trying to do?
You never know what's going to happen next.
Nobody could give the correct answer.
Has your father come yet?
Tom had a gun.
It's a very serious illness.
I knew there was somebody in the next room.
I'd like to make an appointment to see the doctor.
You're so naive.
Tom didn't notice the surveillance camera.
Tom filed for divorce.
Do you have anything to tell me?
He runs in the park every day.
He has only a superficial knowledge of the subject.
Tom has a lot of sheep.
What else could Tom do?
Tom has no reason not to trust Mary.
I never thought I'd say that.
Do you know what to do with this?
Do you accept this card?
He asked me who had painted the picture.
They didn't like you.
Tom didn't thank Mary for her help.
I'm an honest man.
Tom told me he never did that.
"Which one did Tom give you? ""That one."""
Tom told me that he was wrong.
I often hear people say that.
I feel a little tired.
Tom is waiting in the hallway.
I think Tom was lying to me.
Don't you have a boyfriend?
What are your intentions?
He will become a good doctor.
Tom refilled his coffee cup.
Tom is approximately the same age as you.
It was pitch-black.
Tom doesn't have to come tomorrow.
Tom knew where Mary lived.
I told Tom you weren't going to be there tomorrow.
Do you like carrots?
I don't do anything on Mondays.
What have you come to talk about?
Is this snake safe to touch?
How does this work exactly?
This wasn't my idea.
Please tell me the truth.
Isn't that fantastic?
I wanted to die.
Tom and Mary are illiterate.
"If Tom had a lot of money, he'd buy that for you."
I was in Boston in 2013.
I'm not speaking to Tom.
Is there anything to drink in the refrigerator?
Tom made me eat it.
What do the doctors say?
I'll call an ambulance.
Tom shut the door.
Tom is still busy.
It's not going to be long.
It took me three hours to write the letter.
All forms of life have an instinctive urge to survive.
We really need you.
Tom told me he was agnostic.
I heard you and Tom fighting.
He was re-elected mayor.
"Mary is one of the prettiest girls in the whole school. Despite that, she's never had a boyfriend."
I want you to read this book.
I didn't say I would help you.
She trusted me.
I'm sorry I broke my promise.
We need to ask you some questions.
Just ask Tom to help you.
How deep is it?
I'll do more than that.
I know Tom didn't win.
Please wait in front of Room 213.
How much time are you going to stay in France?
I doubt a native speaker would say it that way.
Do you know how dangerous that is?
I love being alone.
Tom would be a better teacher if he were more patient.
It doesn't have any significance.
Please cancel our order.
Tom has already told me that he isn't going to do that.
We aren't too far from Boston.
I hope Tom doesn't have to work this weekend.
I began laughing.
The food was terrible.
I don't have time for guests today.
He shamed his whole family by his conduct.
I want you to decide.
I knew it was time to stop.
Tom moved to Europe.
Express yourself as clearly as you can.

Don't go home.
How much did you pay for the dress?

I've waited too long already.
I have a big surprise for you.
Tom almost never makes mistakes.
Tom handed the note to Mary.
He will always be in my heart.
Call me tomorrow afternoon.
No one's looking at you.
Tom said he liked my idea.
Do either of you know Tom?
We've got to stick together.
Tom has a friend named Mary.
They ate healthier foods.
I need to find something to open this bottle with.
Tom had to wait three hours for a tow truck.
I'm going to Boston tomorrow.
Please turn off the television.
I don't like to go out after dark.

Tom was released from prison on October 20th.
I want to speak with Tom now.
Tom can't be left alone.
I gave the beggar what money I had.
Tom can swim almost as fast as Mary.
Are you alive in there?
I told you it was a risk.
You're a funny girl.
Tom wouldn't eat.
Tom glared at them.
Tom explained the situation to Mary.
I'm your neighbor.
I know where Tom hides his money.
That part is good.
Tom started questioning Mary about where she'd been.
I'm eating here.
Am I hurting you?
Tom doesn't live far from where he works.
There was music.
She loved me in the same way that I loved her.
You're younger than me.
Tom has also studied French.
My house doesn't have an air conditioner.
Tom heard something.
You've lost your mind.
Exhale through your mouth.
I don't want to hear your theories.
It's been recommended to me.
Who do you know here?
I don't think I'll have the time to help you today.
Is the island sinking?
Tom wants results.
Mary was elected queen of the prom.
It's perfect.
I might be wrong.
Didn't you know Tom isn't planning on doing that?
Tom is no longer living in Australia.
Tom said that he didn't do that very often.
Tom has a good ear for music.
I'm waiting for Tom to get back.
That was terrific.
I don't know how to draw a bird.
I'm not going to read it.
Come sing with me.
Do it the way I told you to.
It was unavoidable.
I'm not a murderer.
Tom is like his mother.
I'm used to Tom always yelling at me.
Tom waited outside in the pouring rain for over an hour.
Do you think Tom was angry?
We hope you find it useful.
I had to go back.
Tom and his family emigrated to Australia.
I met him in Tokyo by chance.
We have barely enough bread for breakfast.
Don't push your luck.
Tom is wearing a trench coat.
I don't see Tom every day.
What else are you working on?
Either you or I am right.
I was rude.
I respect everyone's opinion.
Why don't you eat vegetables?
How much longer do you plan to wait?
How long do horses live?
They're on their way.
She can't stop me.
"Such a sales system can work for a while, but not forever."
We all knew that it would happen sooner or later.
I hate my parents.
The firemen's face was grim when he came out of the burning house.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Tom has got to do that.
We have finished the work for today.
I'm sick of listening to her complaints.
I told Tom I'd won.
Tom and I shook hands with each other.
I want to believe you.
Come along with us.
I helped Tom wash the windows.
"A tea with lemon, please."
Will you sing for me?
Are you sure you don't want me to say anything?
I couldn't help yawning.
Where are you planning on going this evening?
Tom can't even sharpen a pencil.
Tom doesn't actually live in Australia anymore.
The baby is called Tom.
Tell me this is a joke.
I still don't know.
That's all I have for you.
Isn't that what you always wanted?
Is that why I'm here?

When was the last time it rained here?
This is going to work. I know it.
Their cattle are all fat.
Promise me that you'll come back.

I was frightened and confused.
The only seat was next to Tom.
Please don't do that by yourselves.
She smells bad.
You have to obey your parents.
He is justly proud of his son.
I knew that Tom was studying French.
"Even with all his wealth and fame, he's unhappy."
You're generous.
"Tom waited, but nobody came."
You'll find the people here very kind.
The statistics are in your favor.
I was content.
I'm going to leave the country.
Thanks for accepting my friend request on Facebook.
That tie looks good on you.
He was so cranky last night.
Tom started to cry.
What contemporary authors do you like?
May I kiss you?
I like to think of Tom as the brother I never had.
Tom said that he'd do that tomorrow.

I am in the classroom.

Do you know how it happened?
Tom said he'd try to convince Mary to do that.
I'm very angry with Tom.
I hear he has been ill since last month.
Tom and I are very tired.
Tom watched quietly.
Can't you hear it?
"Turn it off, please."
Do you teach French?
Tom is really serious about learning French.
I don't know that.
There is no need for you to go yet.
The lake is large and beautiful.
We were playing golf.
I told Tom to consult a lawyer.
"Hopefully, that won't happen again."
We dug a hole in the ground.
Where did you hear that?
I'd say yes if I were you.
What a pity I don't have a garden.
Tom spoke highly of you.
How much do you owe me?
Why does Tom need such a big house?
I marked your birthday on my calendar.
There is no need for us to hurry.
Are you going to have dinner at home?
Where did you buy that book?
This isn't yours.
My uncle's handwriting is hard to read.
I'm still too weak.
I've been acting like an idiot.
We are going to have a baby.
Ford won by one hundred-seventeen votes.
I don't have time to talk to you right now.
Tom hasn't slept for three days.
I received a letter from him to the effect that he could not accept my offer.
Their plan sounds interesting to me.
What you're doing is unforgivable.
Tom dug a hole in the sand.
You didn't mention that on the phone.
How did you and Tom become acquainted?
He bound old letters into a bundle.
Tom told me he wanted to visit Mary in Boston.
We both understand each other.
He yelled with pain.
My brother is now in Australia.
I speak better French than Tom.
I keep a journal.
Why are you always so angry?
Computers save us time.
I asked Tom if he knew my brother's name.
I'll get better.
I own this car.
Pay what you want.
I thought you were a scientist.
I was just curious.
I know that'll be difficult to do.
It was a private message.
I gloated.
I want Tom to drive me to the airport.
Tom will come later.
A lot of people attended Tom's funeral.
There's no new information yet.
I don't know what that thing is.
They're looking for it.
The car started to pick up speed.
Tom asked Mary to open the gate.
You can't make a living being a writer.
The old man spoke to me in French.
How's work?
Tom doesn't remember his grandfather.
Do what you want with it.
I'm sick of this.
"Of all the languages I've studied, French was the easiest."
That was very careless of me.
We're thieves.
"Mary likes her coffee steaming hot, while Tom likes his lukewarm."
Tom bought a drink from a vending machine.
Don't trust your memory.
Why didn't you warn Tom?
When will you be back?
"Sorry, but it looks like I'm booked up on that day."
Tom couldn't even answer the simple questions.
We are looking for engineers.
I can't believe that you kissed Tom.
Tom doesn't want to be here.
I know Tom better than anyone else does.
I don't have any recollection of what happened.
Are you leaving?
Tom doesn't know why Mary isn't here.
They pushed Tom forward.
What's all this noise about?
How deep is this well?
How do you know each other?
It was hard for him to stop working.
He's very timid.
Winter is approaching.
I don't think that prices will go down.
You know something.
Do Tom and John usually wear ties to work?
I'm looking for information about Boston.
Do you think I still love her?
We don't have any drinking water left.
The ground is still wet.
Do you understand the risks?
We're going with you.
Tom sent a text message to Mary.
Tom was 13 years old at that time.
Who was radium discovered by?
Stay away from us.
What'll you have?
Don't you want to eat?
Perhaps you're right.
What scared you?
It's not quite the same.
Tom is just a know-it-all.
My best friend lied to me.
I have seen that girl before.
I don't remember exactly what happened.
I nearly split my sides laughing at Tom's stories.
Don't you want to know who I was with?
That shouldn't be any problem.
What do you do in Boston?
How'd you find it?
I know Tom is a very fast swimmer.
Where did Tom buy that raincoat?
Why are you still in Australia?
I loved both the movie I saw today and the one I saw yesterday.
You should take a day off.
I was invited by an old friend.
How do I know you're not bluffing?
Two nurses attended to the patient.
I thought we would have breakfast together.
I argued with Tom a little bit.
After a storm comes the calm.
Did you get up early?
The plane was late because of bad weather.
Tom will drive you home.
"Sit down, Tom!"
You don't need to explain that.
Tom will check it out.
Do Tom and Mary know what to do?
"We're on the same team, right?"
My brother is old enough to go to school.
One of my classmates used to live in Boston.
Nobody likes rats.
How did you get into my room?
You shouldn't have said that.
I knew Tom wouldn't be afraid.
I'm too old for you.
"Wait, why am I telling you this?"
"Tom loved Mary, who didn't love him at all."
Stop talking to me about Tom.
I got tickets for the six o'clock show.
Tom has already seen us.
It was lucky for you that you found it.
We've found a dead dog in the garden.
There is a great conflict between religion and science.
They admired the scenic view from the hill.
Tom became frustrated when his suggestions fell on deaf ears.
I immediately accepted his offer.
I think all of us want to know what happened.
Harvard is a wonderful university.
We chose her a nice birthday present.
Haven't you been watching the news?
Why did Tom leave you?
Tell Tom I'll be there in thirty minutes.
Didn't you know Tom had relatives in Boston?
We couldn't see the top of the mountain.
Tom is already here.
Kiss Tom.
Are you leaving today?
Write Tom.
There's a party tonight.
He is having coffee now.
I can't kiss you now.
I need to talk with you.
I broke my arm.
Thank you for helping me write my resume.
"That's very, very sad."
We don't want that.
That's what Tom told me.
Tom was tired.
He is what is called a self-made man.
I knew you'd come back.
Have you already decided where you're going to go to college?
We had fun.
I want you to win.
I'll be direct.
Raise your left arm.
I told you to call me.
Do you want to lose weight?
Tom told me he'd rather go home.
Are you related to Tom?
Tom is angry.
I thought you needed the rest.
Just tell us the truth.
I guess I'm in big trouble.
Tom was in a bad mood.
When you start looking like your passport photo you should go on vacation.
Don't get me wrong.
Let's continue the game after lunch.
We'll be in Boston all week.
I don't remember asking you to do that.
Tom asked Mary what she was planning to wear.
I'm not yet convinced.
Tom's lunch includes a sandwich and an apple.
I'm glad I was with Tom.
I worked in Boston.
I'm working in the garden.
Tom's living room was tastefully furnished.
Tom is headed towards Boston.
People think that I'm serious.
I thought Tom was interested.
Let's use this one.
Is your father's name Tom?
I have a niece. She goes to the same school as Mary.
I don't regret it one bit.
The police officer asked Tom to empty his pockets.
Tom said he didn't believe it.
Tom fooled everybody.
What have you not told us?
Did he get married when he was in Germany?
One of those boys is Tom.
I had to pay in cash.
Why can't we do that?
"You know who I'm talking about, right?"
Tom won't have time to do that today.
It isn't my place to question Tom's decisions.
Don't go in the kitchen.
"If you've got something to say, say it."
She has put her house up for sale.
I always felt like she was hiding something.
Is it true that Tom doesn't like Mary?
"After that incident, he never drank again."
Are you seriously thinking about not going?
Are you all nuts?
I suggest you reconsider your decision.
Here's the bill.
What would you like to be when you grow up?
Tom was silly.
Tell me which one to choose.
Find out what Tom knows.
Time travel is impossible.
They laughed at my idea.
What did you steal?
I need you to fix this.
You're under arrest.
I'm glad you noticed.
Didn't you know that Tom wouldn't win?
"If you don't want to go, you don't need to."
How did your test go?
She gave him the car.
We stopped talking so that we could hear the music.
I shot myself in the leg.
I thought you said you had to work.
We haven't lost yet.
I was just pretending I was sleeping.
I want to leave as soon as I can.
Please help me pick out a sweater which matches my new dress.
Can you teach me to fly?
I need to wash my hands.
I knew we wouldn't find anything.
Tom couldn't have done that without Mary's help.
I was worried about you.
"Go ahead, Tom."
He believes whatever I say.
Did you find your passport?
"Tom likes Mary, but she doesn't like him."
Tom ran up the stairs.
Some people think Tom is schizophrenic.
Where do I begin?
He lost his temper and shouted at me.
Don't bother Tom now. He's studying.
You don't need to go there if you don't want to.
I don't know what Tom thinks.
How tall are your parents?
I'm sure you'll tell me what I want to know.
Tom wanted to tell Mary something important.
Tom helped Mary move the sofa to other side of the room.
How's Tom doing today?
He let Tom go.
I'd like to talk about Tom.
Large cars use lots of gas.
I saw Tom get into Mary's car.
A rose smells sweet.
What's your full name?
I understand that a mistake has been made.
What's your favorite drinking song?
Our secret was discovered by the government.
Tom is just doing his duty.
Tom should verify that.
Mary took the bracelet off her wrist.
Everybody ran out into the hall.
I couldn't say a word.
I'd rather stay home with you.
Tell me again when the concert begins.
I only need a minute.
Let's start the party.
Tom has decided not to go to the meeting.
"If you really need a job, why don't you consider working for Tom?"
Tom doesn't plan to go anywhere tomorrow.
Tom is now in danger.
I could do everything faster when I was younger.
Tom canceled his hotel reservation.
You have a wonderful voice.
I know Tom didn't do it.
You are twice as strong as me.
When am I supposed to do that?
Did you eat much?
Tom was frightened by the storm.
Tom hates all of us.
My dad is the best dad in the world.
They were all waiting for me to say something.
It was pretty easy.
Your life depends on it.
I kept walking.
Why didn't it work?
I rarely complain.
What else have you found?
Tom and Mary are intelligent people.
Why are you so clumsy?
Are your lips dry?
Why does Tom never swim?
Tom said that Mary would help.
It's lunch time.
I don't think that I know Tom.
I'm not like Tom.
Tom isn't yet ready to receive visitors.
Tom often makes the same mistakes.
Are you sure we've never met before?
You can go to sleep now.
I'm trying to find out how it happened.
One's lifestyle is largely determined by money.
I planted a peach tree in my yard.
Can you tell the Jackson twins apart?
I think you were wrong.
"If Tom were here, he could help you."
I want you to know that I believe you.
Are we asking too much of Tom?
Tom rolled out his yoga mat.
I haven't seen you in here before.
I just got a few interesting books on religion.
You can't force me to testify against Tom.
What would you like?
I told Tom I didn't want to hear about his problems.
You have to help me.
Tom didn't know what this is.
I have a feeling Tom is lying.
He ratted us out.
Spring is just around the corner.
"I used to have a girlfriend, but we broke up."
Ask Tom how Mary is.
What time do you have breakfast?
Do you want to see what else I've got?
Tom didn't dare say what he really thought.
"How do you say ""thank you"" in French?"
It was Tom who told me that.
Can you teach me how to drive?
Tom taught me how to read.
There's nothing more we can do.
My car wouldn't start.
I have a small gift for you.
I'm very satisfied with your results.
I owe him $100.
I couldn't find anybody.
Tom asked me to give you this.
Aren't you thirsty?
They were all smiling.
Tom has already told me he isn't going to do that.
I was hoping to see Tom.
I'm fed up with your stories!
Did I say something funny?
I'm not good at drawing.
How could you be so irresponsible?
Tom's painting.
No one misses you.
Tom had so much money that he did not know what to do with it. It was far more than he needed to live.
I'm very hot.
Someday I'll run like the wind.
How much is it in dollars?
What does Tom know about this?
Don't ever forget it.
I have a friend living in London.
It is probable that her first album will sell well.
I'm much heavier than you.
Nobody has ever climbed that mountain.
How long will it take to you?
I forget who said it.
I'm not myself.
I heard her sing a song.
You're wrong about that.
I see little of my father these days.
Tom thinks Mary will win.
The radio is out of order.
How many countries are in Europe?
"Which shirt do you like better, the red one or the blue one?"
I do that all the time.
The cat is not dead.
I guess you don't really care.
Don't tell anybody where I'm going.
I don't think that I'll ever do that.
You're dirty.
I leave this evening.
I would like to ask a favor of you.
Tom didn't seem to be pleased.
A revolt broke out.
What were you supposed to do?
What were you doing in Australia?
Tom used to be weird.
Please read this carefully.
"If you don't mind, I'll sit here."
I told Tom he should buy a new car.
Please think about what you're doing.
I've made up my mind.
Tom's father doesn't allow him to drink wine.
Is anything missing?
Can you tell us more about it?
No one's in sight.
Do I have to take this medicine?
"When you have a cold, you should drink plenty of liquids."
Tom called home.
I wasn't the one who wrote this.
I don't think that I can be happy here.
How long do you think it would take you to paint my house?
Tom sat down at the piano and started to play.
She did not let failure discourage her.
Get out of there as soon as possible.
Tom may not be able to come.
Don't scare the children.
Everybody wants one.
Mary says she's never had a boyfriend.
Injustice breeds injustice.
Her daughter is bad at cooking.
Are you coming in?
What's your favorite board game?
You have to speak only English.
I promised I'd tell you the truth.
Why do you only watch horror movies?
I support you 100%.
Tom helps Mary with her homework almost every day.
It's a dead end.
Do you want to know what I'm doing?
I study French here.
I don't want to disappoint Tom.
What was Tom afraid of?
I can't go alone.
Tom wants to know more about Boston.
We should hire a lawyer.
I don't work on weekends.
Tom is sure that he'll pass the next exam.
It so happened that I had no money with me.
I need to think about this.
I went to Boston.
Tom never visits Mary anymore.
He has been living in Ankara for six years.
Mary is hysterical.
Tom isn't my brother.
I just want to know.
You look incredible in that dress.
Do you really think Tom is here?
You seem to be in love with Tom.
You know very well what I'm talking about.
I'm proud that my father is a good cook.
The waiter came over to take away Tom's empty plate.
I've already memorized your phone number.
I'm easy.
Tom was drunk and his speech was slurred.
Go and tell Tom to get ready.
I smile every time I see her.
Tom's well.
It's not new.
Do you really expect Tom to win?
How badly do you want this?
Your French has improved considerably.
He gave up traveling abroad because of his sudden illness.
Did you understand what he said?
They got caught red-handed.
I am listening to a song.
The world doesn't revolve around you.
We were so afraid.
Tom has made his decision.
Never trust anybody.
I'm glad you called.
Tom and I got married in 2013.
I'm sure this is a misunderstanding.
I agree with you totally.
"In the current slump, economic growth has fallen to zero percent."
I hate bats.
This partition separates the two rooms.
I want to emphasize the need to get this done on time.
You never told me about what happened.
That shouldn't have been allowed.
This door is locked from the inside.
There's nothing to worry about.
I don't understand opera.
Tom wanted to be good.
The truck just missed hitting the boy in the street.
This desk is broken.
They didn't know anything.
I'm younger than you.
I knew that Tom wasn't going to do that today.
I want to tell you something.
It's just a figure of speech.
"Tom came to Boston, too."
"You can pretend to be serious, but you can't pretend to be funny."
I'm still afraid of you.
The town was subjected to an aerial attack.
I don't know what's on top of the mountain.
Are all of these people your friends?
Everyone refused to do that.
Do you think it's just a coincidence?
She complained about my low salary.
Give me a few.
I was just trying to protect you.
We both know how that turned out.
Tom's dog ran away.
Tom will be proud of you.
We play games together.
Tom and his friends are swimming in the pond.
How was today's test?
I know what it's like to be heartbroken.
I don't think we're ready.
How many wives has Tom had?
Which one is your favorite?
I didn't know you weren't Canadian.
I've come to save Tom.
"You're not one of us, are you?"
I think you'd better leave.
Do you want to see your room?
It was stolen.
I'm glad I'm not late.
Do you remember the first time that you kissed me?
Don't run.
Tom ate only one sandwich.
Tom went to the library to study.
I haven't heard that joke in a long time.
I'm really proud of it.
Corporations aren't people.
Tom put his wallet on the table.
Tom looks horrible.
How are you going to prove that we did that?
Do you know what I mean?
Tom is very humble.
Please teach me how to play this game.
Everybody is hungry again.
Is Tom better at playing tennis or playing golf?
I can go if you want me to.
Thank you for drawing a bird for me.
I hope that nobody saw me.
Tom and Mary did their homework together.
I think you should leave Tom alone.
The airplane is ready.
This one's free.
Go and find Tom and Mary.
Tom has already decided what he's going to do.
Let's hope we find something.
I know that Tom doesn't like swimming.
Tom says he dreams about Mary every night.
Don't treat me like a kid.
This flower is found in different parts of Hokkaido.
I never even saw you.
Tom ruined my life.
Tom and Mary told me they weren't married.
They took my children away from me.
I'm afraid she will turn down my request.
Tom is unable to work this week.
I have no sisters.
She went to a movie the other day.
Tom rescheduled.
"It's raining, and we forgot to close the windows."
A noise woke her up.
"Basically, I agree with your opinion."
I'm practically already an adult.
He was impressed.
His parents go to church every Sunday.
What's in here?
I can do that faster than you.
Tom is much taller than you.
It reminds me of you.
I'm angry.
I've told you that many times already.
Were you invited?
I doubt that we can prove that.
Summer is the season when women look most beautiful.
I am very tall.
It might've taken longer if Tom hadn't helped us.
Did you read this?
He bores everybody.
Try to stay awake.
Tom believed that Mary could win.
Tom said he'd be home for dinner.
Mine is the red one.
Do you like this flower?
That doesn't reassure me.
We agreed on 2:30.
I brought mine.
I told Tom to stop crying.
I don't need a coach.
That's why I don't like Tom.
Graham Greene is my favorite writer.
I must confess I haven't read it yet.
I caught it.
Tom doesn't need to do that either.
She is my daughter.
This fountain was built in the 18th century.
It was raining cats and dogs outside.
I think Tom is fat.
We've already achieved that.
"Without your help, I would've failed."
Tom will say yes.
You'd better wait until Tom gets here.
You could've waited longer.
I had to find another solution.
Tom escaped by the skin of his teeth.
Did you bring yours?
The police officer put handcuffs on the suspect.
That was Tom's choice.
What did he see?
They talked me into staying a little longer.
I didn't know you were so rich.
I saw some empty bottles lying on the ground.
I thought you said that Tom wasn't here.
I'm going to kill you.
Edison invented many useful things.
Didn't he tell you who he was?
No other lake in Japan is as large as Lake Biwa.
Tom wanted Mary to sing with him.
"You can count on me, Tom."
I know Tom's widow.
Is your gun loaded?
I'd like to introduce you to my wife.
You had better consult a doctor about your health.
Tom hid behind the sofa.
I found this bottle when I was walking on the beach this morning.
The taxi driver refused to take us to that part of town.
You can't control me.
I was really scared.
I don't think that Tom is mistaken.
We all make decisions based on our personal experiences.
The beds are uncomfortable.
Each congressman could vote.
Tom was there.
I can't believe we've finally finished the project.
He read the document aloud.
"Life is good, isn't it?"
Somebody came to see you this morning.
I know you need to do that.
He has a brother in Tokyo.
I've come to save you.
I want you to teach Tom how to drive.
I'm going to meet a customer in his office today.
"In case of emergency, call 911."
I got the message.
They sell things here that you can't get anywhere else.
Tom will cross the river.
Tom and Mary both know that that isn't likely to happen.
This isn't a place for kids.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I think it's pretty obvious that Tom likes Mary.
"You were a sailor, weren't you?"
Tom was in trouble.
Don't tell me you don't like chocolate.
You will be better off buying a new one than trying to fix it.
Tom didn't know I was from Australia.
What's your favorite memory from childhood?
"If there's something bothering you, we can talk about it."
"It's sad, but true."
Just put yourself in my shoes.
How did you make a living in Tokyo?
Let me ask you a question.
I told Tom you had come to Australia.
"Did you want something, Tom?"
She rents a room to a student.
Tom said he wasn't bored.
Tom and Mary are husband and wife.
Tom and Mary just don't care.
Are you free in the afternoon?
I knew Tom wouldn't eat that.
Do not be so critical.
The man wearing the blue jacket is Tom.
I would've said yes.
It could cost you your head.
That's pretty funny.
You're still the same.
My colleagues welcomed me very warmly.
A hideous monster used to live there.
I think Tom might have run away.
What are you going to do with them?
Eat wherever you want to.
We need to find an antidote.
Let's go to the kitchen.
It's not easy to do.
I actually saw a ghost.
You're dressed too warmly.
This is not a pipe.
He feels a lot better today.
I often go downtown on Sunday.
Mary's lipstick is smeared.
Your behavior brought disgrace on our family.
Mary visited her husband in prison.
Tom told me that he'd lost his watch.
You're the tallest person here.
Make room for the baggage.
I'll be there as quick as I can.
I am dead tired.
I was indecisive.
I think you're too picky.
Did you want to tell me something?
"Tom speaks several languages fluently, but for his job, he only translates into his native language."
I made many mistakes.
You should've told me earlier.
Do you think it's my fault?
Tom won't attend today's meeting.
You're too young to do that.
Are you giving up so soon?
Get your things and leave.
This is just a hobby for me.
I was just showering.
He has three sons.
I think you're trying too hard.
I never had a car.
Tom left just a minute ago.
I like swimming and playing soccer.
"OK, I get the idea."
Tom asked me to dance.
Tom is a really strange person.
I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.
Are you busy doing something?
I am very curious.
I'm going to stay.
I can't remember your name.
It isn't going to happen.
How many hours did it take you to do that?
Are you ready to go?
I'm stronger now.
Tom is a trainee.
I can't lie to Tom.
I don't wear a tie every day.
Tom said that he was dying.
I can't stand people like you.
It's cheaper to take the bus.
Tom told Mary to buy some coffee and cigarettes.
Tom is going to kill me.
None of the teachers could solve the problem.
Whose notebook is that?
I was just about to ask you the same question.
Could you explain it to me?
They're fat.
She fell in love with a younger man.
You've got to try it.
I'm not a scientist.
Do you really want to know what I want?
I've already been asked to do that.
That part of the city is very dangerous.
Do you know who sings that song?
Do you think I don't know what's going on?
Tom put the frying pan on the stove.
I have to paint it.
"Where are you, Tom?"
How long is that going to take?
Everyone agrees.
Pitch the ball.
Tom didn't get along with Mary too well.
I'm in college.
His car is similar to mine.
Tom knows how to make money.
Why are you wearing my dress?
I was terribly confused by his question.
There's nothing more I can do for Tom.
I won't be able to attend your wedding.
"Last night, there was a fire in the supermarket."
Tom is a normal teenager.
I think it's time for you to come back home.
Tom says he'll reconsider his decision.
Tom is the only one Mary talked to.
It'll take me a long time to do that.
I'd like to reserve a single room.
The noise awoke me from my sleep.
You're introverted.
Do you think we made the wrong decision?
What does Tom eat for lunch?
Let's take a look.
I wanted to make sure you were alone.
Leave us alone.
We have some time.
He has something to do with the case.
I require your assistance.
Tom's handwriting is hard to read.
I'm your lawyer.
We quickly became friends.
Tom and Mary really loved each other.
Few people can speak a foreign language perfectly.
I did some busking during the summer.
We'll need their help.
I didn't know that I was older than Tom.
This is a family tradition.
Tom didn't want to be with us.
What are you people thinking?
Tom is chewing something.
A girl drowned in the pond yesterday.
It's your turn to pay.
Is that really a good idea?
Do you understand the question?
Are you still angry at me?
"She has gone, but I still love her."
Tom didn't understand what Mary just said.
I truly mean that.
Tom just stood there without saying a word.
He had fallen in love with her.
They told me to wait here.
You should read the newspapers in order to keep up with the times.
Have you told Tom what to do?
We have the same dentist.
Tom wasn't born in October.
Aren't you going to dance?
I thought I was alone.
I knew that Tom would do that.
It is dangerous to fly in this heavy fog.
Tom told me that Mary was very hungry.
That song was written by Tom.
I still believe in love.
I work with her boyfriend.
"Yesterday was Sunday, not Saturday."
I ride a bicycle almost every day.
Tom was thirteen then.
We don't have any bread left.
Didn't your parents teach you anything?
Tom's friends laughed.
I nearly forgot it.
I think you ought to give Tom a call.
I finally found out what was wrong with my TV.
You can be charged with criminal assault without actually touching the victim.
I don't want them to starve.
There is a free bus from the station to the mall.
Should I try it?
Hasn't Tom arrived yet?
Tom and Mary are the only survivors.
Do you want some more pizza?
He walks slowly.
Drive carefully.
Tom hardly ever eats cucumbers.
I've been waiting for you all day.
This is a picture of my mother.
Tom heard Mary was a good teacher.
Tom made a few grammatical mistakes.
Tom handed me the letter and left.
I wanted to be with you.
I'm going to the lab.
Tom and Mary are playing with John's cat.
Tom wants children.
Did you have a lawyer?
The key is in the door.
I know you have to go back to Boston.
Was anyone surprised?
I've caught the flu.
Tom found a gramophone in the attic.
We hope that it doesn't rain tomorrow.
Why don't you show it to me?
I don't understand Tom.
Tom built himself a house.
Give him the benefit of the doubt.
Tom and Mary argue quite often.
Her grey hair makes her look older than she is.
Tom sings better than I do.
I'm the one who has to do most of the work.
I never deceived you.
Do you like snow?
Tom will be a good doctor.
The customer agrees.
How many times did you help Tom do that?
Look back!
Nobody is allowed to leave the classroom until the bell rings.
Why do you walk to school?
You are three centimeters taller than me.
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
Don't tell your dad.
I couldn't believe what I was seeing.
"When I bite down, this tooth hurts."
I told Tom how much money I needed.
He kept an eye on them.
Let me concentrate.
It's too long a story to tell you right now.
Tom and I are very hungry.
The light is green.
I stood up slowly.
Why doesn't he subpoena them?
Tom sent me his picture.
I'm in love with Tom's girlfriend.
Tom promised me he wouldn't cry.
Were you able to do that?
Tom was born with Down's syndrome.
Tom is a little bit like his father.
The reason for this is obvious.
We both love you.
Wake us up in time for breakfast.
Tom is a physicist.
You need to have a heart-to-heart talk with Tom.
I could kill you.
Tom arrived at Mary's at 2:30.
Plastic does not break easily.
She tried to conceal the fact.
I have a few friends here.
I need help now.
Tom isn't poor.
I wouldn't mind a cup of coffee.
It's all you can do for now.
I cleaned up after the party.
I don't like the way Tom smiles.
Tom wasn't at home yesterday.
She phoned him as soon as she got home.
I don't have the time to do that.
Tom is smelling the flowers.
"She didn't come to the party, but nobody knows why."
I'm staying.
What have you gotten us into?
You've put on weight.
Is it included in the price?
Tom didn't want to talk to me.
"It's not what you say that counts, but how you say it."
I need new tires.
The thunder scared the children.
I want to be friends with Tom.
Tom is a dentist.
Tom is friendly with Mary.
I talked to Tom and Mary while I was waiting for John.
Tom went to the kitchen to wash his hands.
Why don't you ask Tom that?
It's not very difficult.
Tom is frugal.
I'll have to try another way.
Tom doesn't believe he can win.
I need your car keys.
Shouting at your computer will not help.
Tom locked his doors.
You said you were going to buy a new car.
Nothing is more important than health.
I want you to get me out of here.
I turned Tom down.
I handed the mike to Tom.
They're pretty loud.
You forgot your money.
Tom just got back from Boston.
You are the last person that I expected to meet.
Do you like apples?
She had to share a bedroom with her sister.
Her mother always accompanies her.
You're both liars.
Tom agreed with me.
Tom didn't try to argue with Mary.
I wouldn't care.
Tom will check.
I knew Tom wouldn't likely do that.
You should learn not to limit your options.
Did you think I was Canadian?
Tom said he's no expert.
Don't you want to give me a hug?
Tom knows that it's not worth doing.
Your mother and I want you to marry Tom.
It'll break.
Tom got in the boat.
Tom thought Mary wasn't here.
What did they take?
I'm in better shape than you are.
The cuffs of his suit jacket are badly frayed.
Tom said that Mary was ill.
It wasn't hers.
Are you blind?
Can you repeat the question?
Can you keep a secret?
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
"Even if I wanted to, I couldn't help you."
It makes me feel alive.
I am an office worker.
You'd better hurry.
I saw you there.
We can't help you now.
What did you and Tom have for lunch?
Have something to eat.
Tom didn't flinch.
I can't drive.
We've got to stick together.
Tom is a bit short for his age.
We saw Tom last night.
I asked for money.
Tom told me you were married.
Figure up how much it amounts to.
We must attack.
When did Tom buy that coat?
Tom needed to talk to Mary about the problem.
Was that a squirrel?
Why haven't you done that?
What's so strange about that?
I couldn't lie to you.
I don't think Tom knows anybody who can do that.
I'll tell Tom about the meeting if I don't forget.
I need to know where Tom is.
Learn what you can.
Tom had never done anything like that before.
Tom was soon arrested.
Tom is a pretty stupid guy.
Tom and Mary are outsiders.
Why didn't I listen to you?
What kind of meal did you eat?
Keep the change!
Tom turned on his computer.
There are no problems.
Does Tom often eat lunch at your house?
Don't you want to know why I helped Tom?
Thanks for reminding me.
Would you mind if I told Tom?
Things are pretty tough these days.
We were kidnapped.
Can you believe this?
Why was Tom chosen?
Tom told me he wouldn't vote for Mary.
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to sing tonight.
Let me just ask you something.
Your room is big.
Tom told me he was homeless.
This was built long ago.
Tom isn't wearing a blue sweater.
Tom is a historian.
Tom did an excellent job.
I thought I was done for.
"Trust me, you're going to love it here."
I have a new plan.
I was tired so I went to bed.
Four more are needed to make fifty.
May I use your dictionary?
What is it you want to talk about?
It's going to take a few days.
Do you think I didn't hear that?
I told Tom I wouldn't tell anybody.
Didn't you know that Tom moved to Australia?
Bring your brother with you.
Tom was mean to Mary today.
I put it in the box.
Tom had a hard time making friends.
Tom was the one who broke the vase.
You're very resourceful.
I'd like to eat some ice cream.
Let's not tell anybody about that.
Get your hands off Tom.
I'm more worried about Tom now.
The wedding ceremony will be held regardless of the weather.
When did you start?
We heard you.
I think Tom wants to kill himself.
Love is never without jealousy.
We're not going.
I don't want to go swimming with you.
Tom didn't want to live alone.
Tom is a distant relative of mine.
This is a picture of my father and his first wife.
We won't let you in.
Did you ask Tom why he did this?
I played football and my sister played tennis.
The suspect was hiding out in the mountains for three weeks.
Stay a moment.
You're very good.
You made a good decision.
Come back inside.
I can't forget her smile.
I've waited so long for this.
How much more time does Tom want?
Nobody knows your secret.
It's on my desk.
Tom is on the go day and night.
Do you think you're smarter than Tom?
Don't expose it to the rain.
I remember them well.
Tom is good at this kind of thing.
Tom didn't want me to sit by him.
You said you wanted to know.
They were stuck in the elevator for two hours.
They may come.
Wash your hands before each meal.
Tom almost forgot to do that.
"It's possible, isn't it?"
This chimney is made of brick.
You know I love you.
How long do you intend to stay here in Brazil?
Everybody knows I hate you.
Stop talking to me about Tom.
There's no sugar in my tea.
How long do you have?
You have a heart of stone.
I refuse to accept that.
I've only been to Australia once.
Tom and Mary finally decided to get divorced.
Tom wants me to go with him.
Do you study every day?
I met one of my old teachers yesterday.
You shouldn't have talked to Tom.
How did you spend your summer?
"If Tom comes, please tell me."
Why did you become a doctor?
There's something wrong with me.
How're we doing?
I can't stand that man.
Tom had never seen such a beautiful garden before.
I hope you can hear me.
Do you want to go to lunch?
It's much better this way.
We told everyone.
Why did you draw a face on the wall?
I don't like people like Tom.
Tom said that he'd vote for Mary.
I didn't know what Tom wanted to do.
Tom didn't seem to be breathing.
Don't you recognize me?
These things only happen in Sweden.
I can't eat any more.
I've only been waiting for five minutes.
Are you dead?
Tom asked me why I didn't show up for work yesterday.
You look very lovely tonight.
Tom said he might die.
Do you sense something unusual?
Check this one out.
The price is reasonable.
I asked Tom to close the door.
I think that Tom is about the same age as I am.
I suspect Tom and Mary are planning to get married.
I'm used to it by now.
Get me some paper.
"Tom tried to kiss Mary, but she leaned back."
Who's the strongest kid?
We'll be there soon enough.
Tom told me he wasn't offended.
You can't force me to do this.
This soup tastes really great.
Who told you to do that?
I am washing my brother's car.
I'm going to miss you.
I fed some meat to my dog.
Tom thinks that he's different from other people.
Tom will kill you.
I feel like eating something.
I'm not lucky.
I forgot Tom knew how to read French.
Didn't you know that Tom was planning to go to Australia with Mary?
You must be careful.
I think it's unlikely Tom will be able to do that.
Half of the apples Tom gave me were rotten.
Tom won't talk to anyone.
Man has the ability to speak.
Have I convinced you?
Is it really necessary to do that?
The enemy kept up their attack all day.
Tom is much shorter than Mary is.
Tom got a loan from the bank.
Are you sure you don't want anything?
This doesn't happen often.
I accept your apology.
Tom was afraid of Mary.
I think that Tom should do that.
You have to fight.
Didn't you know Tom was Mary's grandson?
I'm feeling much better than yesterday.
Tom said that Mary was back.
It'll be our secret.
Is Tom still there?
I'm surprised to see you.
I don't live in Boston.
Fine feathers make fine birds.
I met my teacher by chance at the restaurant last night.
"You pay Tom well, don't you?"
The door is ajar.
"While I was swimming, I got a cramp in my leg."
Tom came.
Tom is always yelling at Mary.
Tom was first in line.
Tom knew a lot.
I didn't think you'd ever speak to me again.
Who will try the case?
Tom said Mary didn't have anything to eat.
I have to be optimistic.
Tom did what he was told to do.
I got promoted.
Tom is the only boy in his class.
Tom was in bed with a cold.
I'm leaving it to you.
The police didn't find any clues.
The mountain was covered with snow.
I need to talk to you.
Please speak English.
Tom left early Monday morning.
The word has several meanings.
Tom buys us vegetables.
I just got the news.
Let's ask them.
What do we owe you?
I feel bad about not having gone to his funeral.
Tom can't go in.
I forgot to tell you how to do that.
Tom seldom drinks coffee in the evening.
This house has eleven rooms.
I'm going to my grandmother's.
I knew you wouldn't be there.
I'll always remember you.
Don't do that here.
Tom knows who to give the message to.
It is time you went to bed. Turn off the radio.
I wish I were a little taller.
Your voice isn't bad.
Tom recently bought a motorcycle.
She read his letter again and again.
I respect you more than anyone.
I'll miss you very much.
Do you know how to juggle?
Who will come with us?
This translation is better than that one.
I don't know if I can get used to that.
You look like you're tense.
Things are about to change.
I don't have to answer that question.
"Tom is fast, but Mary isn't."
Tom eats nothing but fruit.
Did you notice him coming in?
"I went to the hospital to visit Tom, but I wasn't allowed to see him."
"I'm sorry, I misunderstood you."
Nobody will notice.
I won't tell anyone you're in Australia.
You ruined my life.
Who do you think we are?
Tom is worried that he might get fired.
Even Tom is a little surprised.
I forgot to tell Tom something.
Slow down.
Did you invite Tom?
I didn't take your money.
I don't really know much about Australia.
I knew that Tom wasn't in Australia.
Nobody loves war.
Tom was taken prisoner.
Apples grow on trees.
Tom only thinks about making money.
You keep forgetting to pay the bills.
Do you believe he told the truth?
I can't get that song out of my head.
What do think about that?
The police are now checking on Tom's alibi.
I work at a hotel in Boston.
Go and talk to Tom.
We get it for free.
Repetition does not transform a lie into a truth.
Have you thought about it?
I know that you won't like it in Boston.
When is Tom going to do that?
Tom cooked breakfast.
I know you're not lying.
Be quiet now.
Don't lose heart.
I think Tom's losing his touch.
The hotel is run by his uncle.
He is popular with his men.
It was a surprise.
He never saw his sister again.
It is now eight in the morning.
Tom was found dead in his garage.
Don't break the branches.
I'm a happy man.
My friend has a really long name.
Tom doesn't like anyone in his class.
We'll never forget you.
"That's very, very odd."
I think I'll need a little more money.
I know that you're vegetarians.
I interpreted what he said in French into Japanese.
I hope no one saw you doing that.
Tom isn't as smart as Mary.
I want to give this to Tom.
I can't find a place to park.
Your French isn't bad.
I just finished doing it.
You did not say so.
Is there someone else?
This road is very narrow.
We want to fix that.
I just couldn't say no.
Tom gave Mary a quick kiss.
I suppose you think I'm nuts.
I'm sure this is only temporary.
I can't even look at you.
Maybe Tom won't win.
I pretended that I didn't care.
I've been waiting for Tom for an hour.
The police are looking for me.
I have some information for you.
Do you have relatives here?
You said you didn't want to go.
Come here and sit down.
Mathematics is an easy subject for me.
I didn't want to humiliate you.
There is a threat of a storm.
Few people were killed in the car accident.
I'd like to hear your version of what happened.
Look at the price tag.
Tom doesn't have much money with him.
I didn't know which button to push.
I don't want to tell Tom I've been to Boston.
"I don't drink coffee, but Tom does."
Tom only does what he has to do.
Tom didn't seem to understand your explanation.
My mother knows Tom's mother.
Lincoln set the slaves free.
Tom turned white.
We'll never forget you.
Tom turned thirteen.
We talked.
Where can I buy it?
Everyone deserves a second chance.
Didn't you know the door was locked?
Tom thought that Mary wouldn't have to sing.
It's French.
"If I were you, I'd do that."
We need a taxi.
You and I are the same age.
I saw people wearing jeans.
Tom will be going with you.
Your bicycle is similar to mine.
I'll have to talk to Tom.
Tom has gone to Boston.
How many people died yesterday?
"If you eat too much, you'll become fat."
Tom has a dark complexion.
It's all right now.
How did the audition go?
What did you do with my jacket?
Silver doesn't cost as much as gold.
He is known as a rock singer.
Tom couldn't hear what the teacher was saying because all of the other students were making so much noise.
Tom's bedroom door was closed.
You don't need my help.
Can you tell me where I am?
We take nothing for granted.
It isn't worth the trouble.
You were very generous.
I'm tired. I'd like to go to bed now.
I have no idea to what extent I can trust them.
The silence in the forest is restful.
Tom bought that.
He's just an ordinary man.
You did a very good job.
You were always a little odd.
I'd rather not go out today.
The press confirmed the rumors.
You don't fool me.
Tom put his keys on the dining table.
Tom still has questions.
The most important thing in the Olympic Games is not winning but taking part.
We will get to Tokyo Station at noon.
Tom is fighting for his freedom.
Tom is amazingly well informed.
Tom tried to think about something else.
Don't be cruel.
Human life is sacred.
Tom swam to the shore.
I'm too tired to do that today.
I'm lost.
The feeling's mutual.
Nobody came.
Tom gave Mary all his money.
I'm going to tell Tom all about it.
Do you really want to lose weight?
I've been waiting for over an hour.
Something happened in Boston.
I thought you liked everybody.
Tom could say nothing more.
Do you know what room Tom is in?
I'm not going to shoot you.
Read as many books as you can.
How many hours does it take to fly to Boston?
Prices keep going up.
You could help me.
I'm wearing the same clothes I wore yesterday.
Tom took another swig.
This car is too expensive.
We tend to make mistakes.
You don't need to do it right away.
I didn't hear the door open.
I didn't want you to hate me.
Thanks for noticing.
I didn't know which one to buy.
I can't believe this happened.
I know that I can do that.
He lost everything.
How did you like Boston?
I hear he is good at mahjong.
Tom said he didn't want to do this.
Tom wiped his hand on his pants.
I'm busy now.
Tom probably told us the truth.
I know that you don't like Boston.
His novels are popular among young people.
Imagine that you have a time machine.
Can one of you help me?
Your Japanese is good.
We weren't at home yesterday evening.
Did you find the book you were looking for?
I wasn't disappointed at all.
I've never left Boston.
Tom didn't even know Mary back then.
We bought bread and milk.
I have enough money to buy this book.
Doing that will be a piece of cake.
That's going to be hard to do.
I'll be back soon. I have to run to the post office.
Tom doesn't care what people think.
It isn't something that I'm proud of.
I don't think anything is missing.
Tom was the one who discovered the body.
It would be better if you stayed with Tom.
Tom lost his favorite teddy bear.
I can't find my pipe.
I don't think Tom is wrong.
Tom was an accountant.
I was sent home.
Do you want me to read this out loud to you?
Who's in Boston with Tom?
"They searched the house, but found no clues."
I don't think Tom will like this game.
What time did Tom leave the hotel?
Get in. I'll drive you somewhere.
Tom is well-known in Boston.
He is not as intelligent as his brother.
Is that your mom?
Tom hit his sister.
Tom was in that building.
I wanted to know what had happened.
"He threatened me, but I didn't get scared."
Tom never said what he was planning to do.
They left the town an hour ago.
Don't speak French to me.
She was my boss.
I don't know where he comes from.
They're awake.
Find Tom and bring him home.
You'd better go to bed.
Tom called Mary and asked her to meet him for a drink at the bar across from his office.
Tom must be home by now.
We put off our departure because of the rain.
Something seems wrong.
I was working late.
We need to persuade Tom to come.
I hope we can be friends.
I want to see her very much.
I was hoping for more.
It's been a pleasure talking to you.
I won't forgive you for what you did.
Life is wonderful.
Tom was not famous.
Let's continue.
She has lost all hope.
Could you explain?
Let's go somewhere where it's quiet.
Tell her that I am repairing the refrigerator.
Tom tried to remember the name of the girl he'd met in Boston.
The gate opened.
Nothing can force me to give it up.
Now it's Tom's turn.
When does this plane reach Boston?
You and I both know that that's not going to happen.
The door is locked at nine every night.
I thought that was a good deal.
Is it going to snow?
Ask Tom if he speaks French.
I knew I should've stayed at home.
We're like family.
Tom insisted on going there.
Tom told me I should go back to Boston.
I don't want to live where I work.
I just hurt my back.
Tom just got back from the hospital.
Tom did a good job.
I don't think it's going to be hard to do that.
We don't want you to do that.
Let's drop it.
I'm glad you're here today.
Tom will buy something.
I think that that's an important point.
You should be more careful.
Why do you think I'm sitting here?
This place is a dump.
Tom took Mary's hands and brought them to his lips.
Did they hurt you?
There are fifty stars on the American flag.
That doesn't have anything to do with what we're talking about.
Can you shut up?
Open your books.
Everybody has to do that.
I don't have the guts to say no.
We haven't yet had time to do that.
Let's open the box and see what's inside.
Tom made me come here.
Would you hand me the screwdriver?
Tom says he's busy today.
Try again.
She gave birth to a daughter yesterday.
I really hope that you voted for Tom.
Do you want to come inside?
Can I leave Tom a message?
Tom has done something wrong.
Let's wait on the porch.
I don't know anything about that guy.
Did you show it to Tom?
Would you answer some questions for me?
You've got that all wrong.
Who are you and what do you want?
Tom has gone camping.
I got on the plane.
Forget what I just said.
They are saving their money for the purchase of a house.
Mary slipped off her robe and got into the shower.
Who invented the first automobile?
Do you like my friend?
What are you playing with?
Tom always answers his phone.
The fog has lifted.
I can't help you now.
It isn't mine.
What's this zoo's name?
I have a little fever.
"Tom always complains, doesn't he?"
Could you lower the volume a little?
How did you get it?
You gave it to us.
"You're not jealous, are you?"
Why is Tom still at school?
You can go back.
May I see him?
I've asked Tom to help us.
Get down from there immediately.
What is the exchange rate?
I study French with Tom three times a week.
Do you have a fire extinguisher?
It was what I needed.
How much is a ticket?
Are you and Tom coming tomorrow?
The bar is open until six in the morning.
It's a TV.
Tom and I are like brother and sister.
Let's take a train.
"When your friends begin to flatter you on how young you look, it's a sure sign you're getting old."
Rome is famous for its ancient architecture.
Tom and I could go fishing together.
Did you know Tom was a vegetarian?
He will make a business trip to London next week.
Can you take me to Tom?
Why are you angry at me?
John got up much earlier than usual.
The popularity of a web site depends on its content.
It's getting dark.
I think I could do that.
Give Tom the $300.
Admission is by invitation only.
Tom doesn't seem to like Mary.
"Hey, look what I can do!"
I don't think that anyone saw us do that.
Tom says he can't sing.
Does that make you sad?
Almost everyone was late.
You're not so horrible.
Tom was born premature.
What's in your hand?
Tom moved to Boston three years ago.
Please tell me something about yourself.
Tomorrow I must leave earlier.
The rain never let up all night.
Do you really think Tom will come back to Boston?
"If it rains the day after tomorrow, I will stay at home."
Doesn't Tom stay with you when he's in town?
We're going to get married this summer.
Tom says he saw a ghost in his house.
I often have the same dream.
Has Tom eaten lunch yet?
Tom wanted to marry Mary.
He'll go to the hospital today.
Will you take part in the ceremony?
Tom and I cried.
Don't get me started.
Don't you eat that.
Why did you keep it a secret?
We're both OK.
Do you like your new house?
How much time will you need?
I don't need Tom.
Tom accepted the challenge.
Do you want me to open a window?
I don't know what the problem is.
Tom didn't like Mary's husband.
"I called Tom to apologize to him, but he hung up on me."
Write down each word.
Therapy didn't help.
Wash your face.
Why did I ever marry you?
I was able to do that without Tom's help.
I guess you don't really care.
How much is the ticket?
I haven't missed a single class.
Tom convinced me that Mary was right.
Everybody is very busy getting ready for the New Year.
I appreciate it.
What's wrong with your eyes?
I don't want to be an outcast.
Don't deceive him.
Give me the number.
Tom didn't want to go out.
Excessive concern with safety can be dangerous.
Tom is about the same weight as me.
I asked Tom to drive.
I didn't want to involve Tom.
I like my job.
Why don't you just talk to Tom about it?
This book is hers.
I'm walking beside her.
Do you want to go to jail?
"The weather's good here, too."
I had one beer and pretended to be very drunk.
I'm a loser.
Tom knows he shouldn't do that.
This is the last warning.
I know that Tom will help you.
You said that you loved Tom.
Don't look at me with such sad eyes.
Tom told me that he was serious.
Tom didn't blame Mary for what happened.
You can't be sure of that.
I want my children to have the best of everything.
I came to see you.
Tom wasn't here.
Quote me an example.
"I got tired of waiting, so I left."
Tom said you were sick.
We washed our hands.
I don't want everyone to know.
Everybody voted yes.
Do you feel sorry for Tom yet?
Tom doesn't have to hurry.
I wonder how many Canadians live in Australia.
I come here often.
What does Tom want us to do?
Tom trimmed his beard.
I think Tom is from Australia.
I'm sorry if I offended you.
You seem very nervous this morning.
When are you moving to your new house?
Tom said Mary saw John doing that.
Tom has been accused of shooting an unarmed man.
Teaching young children isn't easy.
Why don't you drop by sometime?
I paid for these tickets.
I'll catch you.
Tom felt betrayed.
What right do they have to do that?
Can you get the work finished in time?
That seems unlikely.
She lived an unhappy life.
Tom met his wife in Australia.
People don't say that anymore.
Are you already married?
Can we do that later?
I'm useless.
Tom understood everything.
The dog followed me to my home.
How many cats are there in this house?
I don't have the money to buy it.
"In the summer, I go to the sea, and in the winter, to the mountains."
They're so funny.
Tom looked at the horse.
Do you use aftershave lotion?
I understand your feelings.
Everyone must go home.
I shot a bear.
That sounds like a scam.
I think I can.
What do you like?
What do you think I should write?
I'll eat fish.
It's a very difficult question for me.
Give me some time.
Tom would've made the same decision I'm making if he were in my shoes.
She stayed at home all day instead of going out.
You can't pretend that it didn't happen.
You have no fever.
Is tomorrow Monday?
Didn't you know Tom died in Australia?
Tom has left the building.
I waited for Tom for three hours.
What's the horse's name?
Just pretend you don't know me.
How can I thank you?
You don't look that busy.
Aren't you going to invite Tom to your party?
Tom told me that he was very hungry.
You're scaring the kids.
And what exactly were you doing?
Tom has been there three times.
"Are you going to go with us, too?"
Who did you think I was?
Please listen to us.
I want you to go to Boston with Tom.
"Apparently, Tom used to be a teacher."
Tom is likely to be gone.
I need to see you in my office.
You should study French harder.
I live here now.
Tom helped Mary carry her bags.
It isn't mine.
"In my opinion, Tom is right."
Tom has been out of work three months.
Maybe we should go home.
All Tom needed was a little more time.
Is this your first time in Korea?
I haven't yet graduated.
My desk back home is very similar to this one.
Even plastic surgery won't do anything for your ugliness.
Half of the town burnt down in the fire.
Cyprus is an island.
Don't be afraid to ask if you need help.
That happens a lot.
They met in secret.
They just left.
You must be from Australia.
I don't like fishing.
I will do it tomorrow.
We spent a quiet day in the country.
What makes you think I don't want to go?
Do I need a tie?
Mary is a cheerleader.
Please turn off the TV.
Let me say what I think.
"If I won the lottery, I'd buy you a new car."
What's all this fuss about?
Tom intends to live in Boston for more than a year.
My computer is a lot better than yours.
Tom doesn't have a gun.
We must finish this.
It is cruel of him to say such things to her.
Did Tom say what he needed the money for?
Tom's parents have a lot of money.
What have they done to you?
"You don't like them, do you?"
Tom understood me.
I knew what to expect.
I thought a cup of coffee might make you feel better.
You bought a lot of jewels.
Why are you packing?
Tom is searching for a way out.
You've been through a lot.
When did you start studying Latin?
Come tomorrow.
I'll give it to you.
Tom can't help us today.
I need to talk to you about Tom.
I can't say I'm surprised.
"Tom, what were you looking at?"
I'm going to learn French.
We'll go jogging in the park.
Maybe you're wrong.
I think Tom is enjoying himself.
Are we in the same hotel?
I like both of them very much.
I didn't want to look stupid.
It's broken.
My watch is gold-plated.
"When he heard the news, he turned pale."
Tom has promised to help us.
"When I was your age, I had a job."
You must do that yourself.
I'm sure Tom understands what needs to be done.
I fixed myself a cocktail.
Tom knocked lightly.
I'm sure I'll succeed.
Is it October already?
Tom didn't even have enough money to buy a cup of coffee.
I'm so tired. I'm not even sure whether I'll be able to survive this day.
I haven't decided yet.
My suitcase is packed.
Tom has never needed anybody.
Tom was beginning to realize what was going on.
You really don't understand.
We can do this if we work together.
I think Tom will be well prepared.
The decision's already been made.
Let's play cards instead.
I don't think Tom would want to go to Boston with you.
I can't stand it longer.
I was the one who showed Tom how to do that.
What do you think this could be?
Do you know how old Tom is?
I'm glad you decided to come.
I want to be a poet.
Everybody calmed down.
He loves soccer.
I have no ulterior motives.
I thought I'd never be happy again.
Back away from the computer.
I thought it'd be easier.
We've seen him.
Tom didn't sleep well last night.
Tom likes to show off in front of girls.
I didn't do that. Tom did.
I'll be inside.
There are no victims.
Tom feels at home in the jungle.
Tom isn't telling us the truth.
What did Tom buy?
Tom put thirty dollars on the table.
Tom isn't much of a dancer.
I agree with much of what Tom said.
"According to the weather forecast, it will clear up tomorrow."
"It's you who's changed, not me."
Go and tell Tom.
Didn't you know that I was from Boston?
I never liked that.
Didn't you know that Tom is from Boston?
Did you tickle Tom?
Tom thinks Mary will cry.
Tom kept a lot of cash in his house.
What happened to you yesterday?
"That's a job of your own choosing, isn't it?"
It failed.
Few people live to be a hundred years old.
Tom admitted he was afraid.
Tom's flight has been delayed.
Can you see the woman standing behind Tom? That's Mary.
Could you please zip up my dress?
Tom is a bit shorter than Mary is.
I can't permit this.
Somebody stole Tom's wallet.
We have to pick a name for the child.
Everyone knows that Tom won't win.
He will hire someone who speaks English.
Tom painted the window frames yellow.
I paid for Tom.
I could come with you.
He doesn't like us.
I'm really sorry about what happened.
Would you mind if I asked you a few questions?
Tell Tom not to tell Mary.
Are you lost?
Someone just came in asking for Tom.
Sometimes it's not so simple.
"If there's anything you want to do, you should do it if it makes you happy."
Do the doors lock?
Don't take his remarks too literally.
Tom said he didn't have any regrets.
My hands were cold.
Is this a radio?
Did I do all that?
He should thank me.
My father gave me a game.
Just pull yourself together.
I feel bad for her.
Are you sure you don't want to wait for Tom?
He will be at home tomorrow.
Tom should thank Mary.
How high can you jump?
I don't want to regret anything.
"Yes, we can go."
I'm not going.
She looks better in Japanese clothes.
I know you aren't ready.
Did you go to the market yesterday?
We should've thought of this before.
I didn't have to go.
You're not crazy.
He joined the Army during the war.
It's not as hard as you think.
"He's an Englishman, but lives in India."
Have the children eaten yet?
You should have told me a long time ago.
Voice of America broadcasts from Washington.
We need to wait here.
That'll be enough for the present.
I've studied Japanese for five years.
They know who he is.
Are you ready to fly?
Tom pulled out a book and started to read it.
I don't think anyone suspected you weren't really Tom.
Tom told me he didn't do anything wrong.
I learned to cook from my mother.
Tom always talks about work.
Didn't you know that I didn't have to do that?
Tom seldom washes the dishes.
Tom put the card face down on the table.
She told him her age.
I didn't know you were so rich.
I just wanted to hear your voice.
I'll give you a call tomorrow.
Tom got lost in the desert.
Where did you go swimming?
My brother is very good at playing the guitar.
Tom is smarter than Mary is.
How many concerts did you go to last year?
Tom became serious.
What do you usually eat for supper?
Are you saying that I killed Tom?
It's not there.
"How long have you been living here? ""It'll be five years next week."""
I had a tough day.
Tom was paralyzed by fear.
What made Tom so mad?
I needed something to drink.
I have many Canadian friends.
I know his address.
I have already done my homework.
This room is very large.
I passed out.
Don't forget to tell Tom.
I'll never talk to Tom again.
"Let's not talk about this anymore, OK?"
Tom told me not to trust you.
You know I can do it.
We go to school by bus.
We asked everybody if they were hungry.
Tom isn't very good at cooking.
His book is famous not only in England but also in Japan.
Six seismologists were convicted of manslaughter in Italy after they had failed to predict an earthquake.
I want to buy an automobile.
Why don't you ask Tom that?
I came here to play soccer.
I want you to make a choice.
You better sleep.
Go.
I stopped and looked behind me.
Tom had on shoes but no socks.
I need to take a shower.
I didn't feel like studying because the noise outside was getting on my nerves.
"I don't like hot weather, but Tom does."
I really miss Tom.
Look straight ahead.
Your friend Tom is here.
Tom was very jealous.
Tom only wears black clothes.
I rarely listen to the radio.
Tom died about three years ago.
What's really bothering you?
I'll see you in court.
Don't give candy to my children.
Do you have it by any chance?
I didn't know you were drunk.
I don't know Tom's phone number.
Tom is one of Mary's brothers.
Tom has acne.
What makes you so sure?
"Tom won't help, will he?"
I recovered.
Tom woke me up.
Tom boiled some water.
I said that.
I am sure of his victory.
Take over.
She attributed her success to luck.
Don't forget the candles.
I'm afraid that I won't finish the report on time.
He sat next to her.
It was very foggy.
I don't want to be found.
Can you hear me now?
It's been so long.
Tom is sleeping in the living room.
I didn't think you'd be worried.
Tom comes here almost every Saturday.
I want something different.
How tall you are!
Here's my ticket.
"Thanks to you, I have problems with my blood pressure."
I didn't want Tom to leave.
I told Tom to wait for me in the lobby.
You must go.
Why didn't you listen to your mother?
There's no danger.
How did they find out about you?
"When I got up, the sun was already high in the sky."
You're getting more and more beautiful every day.
Who was here first?
I haven't done this in a long time.
Tom said he isn't used to this kind of food.
I'm tired of watching television.
Tom is good to me.
Tom lives in the same part of town as Mary.
You know where I'm going.
My father has been dead for ten years.
Neither Tom nor Mary wants to do that.
Who did you talk to?
Tom was home alone.
I was going to go.
I'm so proud.
I think you're going to like Tom.
Tom and Mary and their children all live together in a small house on the outskirts of Boston.
Tom is a true scientist.
"Until yesterday, I had never heard Tom speak French."
Tom pretended that he didn't hear Mary.
They have one thing in common.
It was a dream job.
I'll be back in two hours.
"As for me, I have no objection."
I had no idea you could do that.
I solved the puzzle.
We're going to go to Boston next.
I'd never agree to do that.
I didn't ask for these.
Tom hasn't gone swimming in a long time.
How much money did you borrow from Tom?
Tom is being chased by paparazzi.
Don't wait for me for dinner.
Tom and Mary said that they couldn't swim.
He's good at telling jokes.
I know Tom is watching us.
Can you use a computer?
We don't want you to do that.
Why did you lie to me?
We're waiting for the right time.
Tom said it was too cold.
We were here yesterday.
Tom must have heard our voices and escaped.
You tricked me.
Where can I get my baggage?
I want to make sure Tom is OK.
They went on a trip a few days ago.
That's a sad excuse.
Tell Tom to stop fooling around.
Tom didn't think that he was going to get caught.
I'm not going to school today.
How long will it take for the mistake to be noticed?
All you have to do is sit down here and answer the doctor's questions.
Please don't worry.
Fight like men.
I eat alone.
"Look, you've got to help me."
Tom plays golf really well.
Why don't you just try it?
Please wait a minute.
Is French hard to learn?
Didn't you know that Tom and I are Mary's parents?
Tom understands French.
I knew you wouldn't wait.
You are three centimeters taller than me.
Someone's calling.
I had a little help doing this.
I turned the lamp off and fell asleep.
Where in Australia are you from?
How about going to the movies?
The cat is on the rug.
I wish you weren't already married.
I can't just let Tom kill me.
I slept all day.
She writes to her son every so often.
I've already thought about that.
Tom was leaning against the wall.
Do you know when Tom and Mary are getting married?
He died from overwork.
I've bought some clothes.
That's no excuse.
Tom won't help.
Where are the showers?
Bell invented the telephone.
Am I the only one who thinks it's a bad idea to buy Tom's old car?
I'll do as you advise.
I need to win.
This is our land now.
He is always finding fault with other people.
Rumor has it that Tom and Mary are going to be married soon.
Everybody's talking.
Don't shut your eyes.
I love you and I want to marry you.
Tom carried two boxes into the storage room.
"How old are you? ""I'm 16 years old."""
Mary looks like her mother.
I came home at 2:30.
We've made a very interesting discovery.
Tom seemed happy.
I still don't know what happened.
I've got a lot of questions I need to ask you.
Tom doesn't want to talk to anybody.
You have only three minutes left.
I remained seated.
I think you should do it.
Tom was a taxi driver for about three years.
I'm not proud.
Who do they belong to?
I'm trying not to think about it.
Tom still has to finish painting the fence.
I'm going to take some pictures.
I don't think that it'll take long.
Please don't be mad.
I don't always go to bed before midnight.
Tom should've been a lawyer.
I'll tell you an interesting story.
I hope we can all agree.
You're the one who hired Tom.
Do I need braces?
I wonder why Tom lied to us.
I'm horrified.
"If it's there, I'll find it."
I had to throw most of my things away.
They're kidding.
How many instruments do you know how to play?
Didn't you know Tom doesn't like Mary?
I think Tom is nice.
Don't jump!
That's how I came to know her.
"Someone put it there, but I don't know who."
I knew you wouldn't wait.
Wear whatever you want.
My dream is to become a famous singer.
There's no getting away from that.
I've done that more than once.
Nobody knew that you were in Germany.
Why are you always so pessimistic?
Tell me what's going on.
Panicking won't help.
This book will do.
Don't go out after it gets dark.
"I am a student, but he isn't."
"People say that I dream every night, but if I do, I can't ever remember any of my dreams."
"I'll take that one, too."
She taught us singing.
I haven't seen Tom in very long time.
Think about them.
I'd never say that.
Does Tom like his job?
I consider myself lucky.
I've been waiting for you since 2:30.
Tom got out of the car to open the gate.
Do you blame me?
I don't think that Tom is cold.
See what can be done about it.
The chances of dying from falling airplane parts are 30 times greater than the chances of being killed by a shark.
Are you telling me Tom doesn't know?
How long have you been living in Australia?
I think Tom had something to do with this.
Tom loves his job.
"He doesn't even drink beer, not to mention whiskey."
"Without your help, we wouldn't be able to carry out our plan."
I think Tom could do that.
Didn't you know Tom and Mary used to be married?
The Sahara Desert is almost as large as Europe.
"In legal documents, difficult words and phrases are often used."
Tom has low blood pressure.
That was my fault.
Tom will pay you.
May I open the window?
You shouldn't write in library books.
"You know his name, don't you?"
Tom got a job as a waiter.
They got him elected Mayor.
I'll tell everyone.
Divorce is always painful.
I didn't know you were sleeping.
Tom lost the bet.
"Sorry, the book is out of stock."
Please don't write to me again.
Did Tom tell you where the party is?
"You aren't Canadian, are you?"
Tom bought some fruit.
I know that sounds naive.
We didn't wait for Tom.
They have English lessons three times a week.
Tom doesn't know anything about Mary's past.
I didn't want Tom to worry.
They didn't find anything.
Everybody will be home on Christmas.
Life without love has no meaning.
"First, I want you to apologize to Tom."

Are you recording us right now?
Don't forget.
Who wrote this?
Tom was re-elected.
Are you afraid?
Tom decided to take the day off.
Tom didn't seem to remember where Mary lived.
I also like cakes.
I want to do my best to help Tom.
There are many old Indian legends.
You need to see this.
I know I'll be punished.
Tom had blood on his hands.
The coffee is very hot.
Tom tossed some bread to his dog.
Everyone knows what's going on.
We have 30 minutes.
Were you working last night?
Why is Tom in the hospital?
I feel ready.
Let's get together here once a week.
We're alone.
I think that's already happened.
Has Tom returned?
It isn't so hot today.
He had no place to live.
Ukraine is a big country.
Don't worry about Tom. He can take care of himself.
Tom detests Mary.
I used to be pretty good at this.
I am afraid of dying.
Did you buy any eggs?
I tried not to look.
Tom tried to persuade Mary to stay at home.
Your house is three times as large as mine.
I have already finished reading this book.
Tom seemed pleased to see me.
You were very clear.
We've got to leave.
Where did you get it?
Are you going to leave?
Tom said you were hungry.
I like volleyball and basketball.
We're going to wait for Tom.
"I studied French a long time ago, but now all I remember is ""bonjour."""
Are you going to eat that bread?
I don't want to kill anyone.
Are you looking for Tom?
None of them could understand what she was implying.
Are you a vampire?
We were both proud of you.
My mother tried to reconcile the couple.
May I stay here with you?
Tom wants some milk.
I won't forget what you did.
My sister got engaged.
I like to lie on my back and watch the clouds drift by.
It's the only thing you can do.
When was the last time you did the dishes?
I feel like I'm going insane.
I'm still a bit groggy.
We will never agree.
He's quite active for his age.
I told you not to go by yourself.
It'll be beautiful.
You'll soon get used to the climate here.
How do you pronounce your name?
I was careful.
Were you scared?
There were fifty entries for the race.
What did Tom bring?
Tom seldom wears his black shirt.
He never saw his sister again.
Did you tell Tom about tomorrow's meeting?
I wasn't alone.
Don't touch that book.
I thought you were done.
It took three years.
Ask before you borrow your sister's clothes.
Tom made friends with Mary.
Let go of my hand.
I need my glasses.
I observed that his hands were unsteady.
Do I have to stay in the hospital?
Tom is a racist.
Can I do something for you?
Did that make Tom mad?
I feel I can help.
Almost all of Atlanta was destroyed.
I think you know we have to help Tom.
What will Tom think?
I know Tom is your friend.
My parents left me here all by myself.
I love watching birds.
He will be back in a few days.
It's already dark.
Tom has a mahogany desk.
May I ask why?
What size shoes do you wear?
How much will it be?
I hope it goes well.
"Your name is Tom, isn't it?"
Is this book yours?
Fold it.
I don't think Tom knows when Mary will be here.

I was exhausted.
What do I look like?
Call her tomorrow.

An apple fell to the ground.
I'm sorry I made you wait so long.
I like football.
I was about your age when I came to Australia.
Let me show you my new apartment.
He is a wolf in sheep's clothing.
I told Tom not to tell anyone.
I explained the procedure to him.
I knew Tom had to do that.
Everyone was looking for you.
Which would Tom choose?
Tom has asked me to do that already.
Will you please call me this evening?
I told you never to call me again.
It's just stupid.
I went a different way.
I like cooking.
Tom speaks French as well as Mary does.
Do you like this tie?
Tom says he doesn't know why Mary didn't enjoy the movie.
I want to come back to Boston.
I saw Tom's father.
Where are the restrooms?

I love you like a son.
I know about you.
She belongs to the Democratic Party.
You may go home now.
I want to play the guitar.

I'm glad we met.

Tom left the office just a minute ago.
Call me when it's done.
How long did it take you to write the letter?
Do you have any questions?
It was a very stupid decision.

I'd like to talk about it now.
This one is cheaper.
Her father died.
Why can't I kiss Tom?

We have a theory.
Tom got here early.
You may not get this chance again.
I didn't know Tom was already dead.
I go to the city pool every day.
Tom said it was raining.
We're hoping for something better.
Maybe Tom feels the same way.
Let's go for a walk after lunch.
It's not serious.
"I knocked, but no one opened the door."
He is not altogether a fool.
This textbook is intended for foreign students.
Tom helped me a lot.
No one's looking at you.
You don't have to worry about me anymore.
Tom can walk.
I've always thought you were from Boston.
I don't understand how to do it.
Tom is feeling really Christmassy.
What do you like to read?
Has Tom already left?
Tom had nothing to lose.
American troops stayed in Nicaragua until 1933.
You can call me whenever you want.
He ate the whole apple.
Can you let Tom know what's happened?
They're not coming.
Tom's sister paved the way for him to become a lawyer.
It took longer than we expected.
Why are we still talking about this?
I don't think Tom will be first.

Many workers were trapped in the coal mine.
What you do matters.
Did you draw this?

I know you and Tom skipped school yesterday.
Are we done here?
Tom is looking for his umbrella.
I want to sit down.
I like it when you sing.
You can leave early if you like.
Tom is likely to pass the test.
I'm afraid that won't be enough.
He was hit by a car and died right away.
You're careless.
I agree with you on that point.
I'm ready to order.
That's why I didn't tell you.
I'd like to send this by registered mail.
Tom got up to leave.
Tom is naked from the waist up.
He painted the ceiling blue.
You were like a brother to me.
Tom said Mary was alone.
I broke the lock opening the door.
Mary bought a present for her friend's daughter.
I always said no.
I don't think it's a big problem.
I will never forget your kindness so long as I live.
Don't come back.
I suspect that Tom didn't really want to do that.
Talk to me.
I saw it.
Tom hasn't been told to do that yet.
Come at eleven without fail.
Don't make the same mistake again.
We'll do what we can.
Couldn't you do that later?
I didn't like it at first.
He is tall and looks strong.
I'm not likely to need a gun.
There's a magazine in my room.
Tom turned on the lamp.
You probably think I'm crazy.
"Why does Tom call me Mary? ""Isn't your name Mary?"" ""No, it's Maria."""
I was just passing by.
There was no need to call the doctor.
There is little chance of success.
Two thousand people fit into this hall.
Maybe I should join you.
It was windy yesterday.
Let me tell you something about Tom.
I don't want you to panic.
I wonder who invented it.
The strong wind died away at night.
How long have we got?
I turned the computer off.
Didn't you know Tom didn't like Mary?
Tom didn't think he needed protection.
Tom didn't look too surprised.
I'd love to go.
The last time I spoke to Tom was last Monday.
I need to finish writing this report by Monday.
What's Boston most famous for?
I almost got fired.
He had to withdraw.
She has been practicing the piano since morning.
He doesn't realize what he's lost.
I was in the library.
Why are you so busy today?
How could Tom have married such a woman?
Tom's bruises were barely visible.
Do you and Tom spend a lot of time together?
She pulled down the blinds.
I was hoping you could do it.
It is important for old people to stay strong.
What do you think of this tie?
Tom is not welcome in this house.
I think that I don't deserve it.
Guess what Tom said.
Sacrifice is sometimes necessary.
Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System.
Tom did everything he could for Mary.
They were seen to go out.
I'm going to do you a favor.
Tom seems moody.
Boston is the most interesting city I've ever visited.
I can never thank you enough.
Did you know mosquitoes have teeth?
I'll give you as much money as you need.
I can eat anything.
I don't remember anything.
Maybe there's a secret door.
We won't forgive you.
I want to buy a more expensive watch.
Tom asked Mary where she had gone.
Tom is looking for a job.
I'm glad that you got home safely.
Please let me sleep for five more minutes.
Good morning. We have good weather today.
I told Tom that he had to do that.
Tom bought a straw hat.
I was careful.
Who's your favorite composer?
How many bowls do we have?
I know you don't know Tom.
Tom has been abroad for three years now.
Does Tom have a bicycle?
I want you to call me as soon as possible.
They speak Spanish in Mexico.
I'm glad they're both on our team.
Tom has been hunting for a job since he lost his previous job last year.
I assume Tom can speak French.
Please don't make me sing.
He has powerful arms.
Which one was your favorite?
I don't like kids.
Didn't you know that Tom was going to be here?
Tom is seldom home.
He is studying history at the university.
Stand up and walk.
Wait till the light turns green.
Tom knows that I used to live in Boston.
It isn't always hot in Boston.
You'll enjoy working here.
This is the moment of truth.
Tom insisted I come alone.
Tom told you the wrong price.
The sky started to darken.
Tom spoke.
You can go if you want to.
That gave me a lot of pleasure.
I can give you an autograph if you want.
I think that's the reason why Tom is here.
I haven't fed the dog yet.
Have you told your mother?
I'm trying to get in touch with her sister.
You are always late.
I'll help you find Tom.
Tom is going to win.
I've just eaten so I'm not hungry.
The cause of the accident is still obscure.
This is too easy for him.
He showed me his collection of stamps.
I'll be there in five minutes.
We need three rooms.
One of the kids didn't get off the bus.
I caught three fish.
He betrayed you.
It gave me an idea.
Tom isn't going to help.
Please don't laugh at me.
What don't we know?
What does your brother do?
They got thoroughly wet in the rain.
Tom has been very generous.
Give me a hoist.
We saw it.
Tom unloaded the car.
Tom is almost blind.
I suggest you go to Boston with Tom.
I did what Tom told me to do.
Is that what you want me to say?
Tom and Mary said that they haven't yet been paid.
I'll never be young again.
The law does not apply to this case.
I saw the boat sink.
Cows supply us with milk.
My students are waiting for me.
Do you want to know who donated the money?
Tom is right here.
"We're not as stupid as you thought, right?"
The book fit into Tom's pocket.
My doctor told me I should eat more.
We are getting older day by day.
I think you don't understand what's going on.
I knew you two would hit it off.
I waited inside.
Why isn't your name on the list?
You'll be sorry!
Tom is unbelievably naive.
Tom is wearing a blue sweater.
I don't like baseball at all.
I got off at the bus stop and went to the right.
Tom moved.
The point is that we don't know what is happening around us.
It's almost impossible to read Tom's handwriting.
He watches at least one movie a day.
I tripped.
Don't believe it.
Tell me where Tom is.
I would like to know what you intend to do now.
The children broke the ancient urn.
It's rude to ask someone how much they earn.
Everything seemed normal.
Tom will get angry if I don't do that.
I disagreed.
What did Tom ask you to do?
I explained why we had to do that.
It is because you work too much that you are sleepy all the time.
Are you sure this is the right number?
I'd like to meet your family.
His work is washing cars.
Did you find another picture?
Tom pulled something out of his pocket and put it on his desk.
You shouldn't have talked to Tom.
I admire your restraint.
Don't look.
How do you know you wouldn't have done the same thing Tom did if you were in his shoes?
I'd like to live in Europe someday.
Tom finally answered.
We got drunk together.
It's been recommended to me.
Why do you want to learn a foreign language?
I went to the hospital.
Can I have the list?
I escaped death.
Tom asked Mary about her job in Boston.
Tom was not much older than Mary.
Please don't forget to close the windows.
He has braces.
Don't make promises that you can't keep.
The apple trees will probably start to blossom next week.
I'm a coward.
"A long time ago when Pluto was still a planet, there was a boy named Tom."
The men have been shorn of their power.
"It was a very, very hot night."
Doing the laundry is my job.
How many weeks will it take you to do that?
He is lazy.
I like your hat. Where did you get it?
Where did you get that much money?
We finally struck a bargain.
I prefer to write in cursive.
Why don't you go in my place?
You never can tell what some people might buy.
Tom said hi to me in French.
Your answer to the question is not correct.
Many young men went to war.
There's only one difficulty.
I want you to make the decision.
You're all alone.
Can you explain why?
Is this the place where your mother works?
I remember hearing about Tom.
Tom wanted Mary to cook dinner.
Let's take Tom with us.
What scares you most?
I told Tom why Mary wasn't here.
"You have a kid, don't you?"
Tom doesn't like to ask for help from people he doesn't know.
I'm not sure this is a good idea.
Am I talking to myself?
I thank you for the warning.
Why do we have to go to that meeting?
I was able to see the smoke from here.
The man helped me when I was in trouble.
Tom never tells us anything.
The students often copy each other's homework.
Barbecuing is one way to cook meat.
What color clothes do you usually wear?
I think Tom can win.
This dish is tasty.
"I wanted to say something, but I was too scared."
My girlfriend cried.
I forgot to return your umbrella to you.
"I'm not hungry, but I'm thirsty."
We probably won't have to go to Boston anymore.
Nobody should've died.
I warned Tom about Mary.
Can anybody help me?
I've already told Tom I won't help him.
They pitched their tents on the beach.
He came by bus.
Tom has never been back to Australia.
Tom swims better than Mary.
It doesn't matter much.
I thought Tom was having fun.
Tom doesn't need it.
I'm crafty.
I've never seen a scorpion.
You haven't seen anything yet.
Are you American or French?
It is interesting for me to read my old diary.
You're not laughing.
I'd like to drink another cup of coffee.
I'll show you where it is.
I thought everybody knew that.
What'll you do this weekend?
This is my favorite movie.
Tom and I are happy.
Turn it on.
I exercise.
The train was due at six.
Have you ever noticed that Tom's right ear is much larger than his left ear?
Has the rose blossomed?
The fender was badly dented.
It's six o'clock already.
Tom got really angry.
You should go to bed. It's almost midnight.
It is our duty to help them.
Prices have jumped.
I've gotten used to going to bed early.
I'd like to meet Tom's sister.
I guess I'd better go.
What would you like to buy?
Tom yelled at Mary in French.
"Thank you very much, doctor."
Tom often laughs at his own jokes.
I know you don't know who I am.
Why does it matter to you?
Today I love the entire world.
Who was it that read my diary while I was out?
"All of a sudden, the lights went out."
Tom is lying on his side.
Tom never would've done what you've accused him of doing.
Didn't you know that Tom was going to be here today?
The girl wearing the blue coat is my daughter.
That's just how I am.
"Please talk to me, Tom."
"I tried to tell Tom, but he refused to listen."
I think that they will be late.
You didn't tell me Tom speaks French.
I always looked out for Tom.
Tom told everyone.
The rich sometimes despise the poor.
You're so mysterious.
My neighbor called the fire department.
Here's my driver's license.
Tom lost his house key.
You must be homesick.
I'm not blind.
Tom could have phrased his answer more politely.
Please shuffle the cards.
I'll tell you what you should say.
I'm faithful to my wife.
I had a tooth pulled out.
You read too much.
He lives alone.
Don't leave that here.
I know you don't remember me.
She married a sailor.
Is it really that important to you?
That'd be fun.
Tom is lonely because he has no one to play with.
We call New York the Big Apple.
I don't think that Tom has the money to buy a car.
I just don't know why Tom doesn't want me to help him.
Did you receive my message?
He is taking a day off today.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
It's going to be a busy day.
Show me where the pain is.
Tom stayed there for three hours.
The 9:35 train stops at Bambury.
Where could I find someone to help me?
Tom will be with me all day.
I wasn't having fun.
You can read this book.
I stayed in the hospital for a week.
Tom can help you.
I was hoping you would know Tom's address.
What qualities do you most admire in Tom?
Both Tom and Mary are over thirty.
Tom wasn't the only survivor.
Let me show you what I bought today.
Don't overdo it.
How much money do you have on you?
I don't want to play golf anymore.
I'm very proud of this team.
She is always smoking.
Tom threw out the old newspapers.
You should've come here earlier.
I think it's beautiful.
She believes her son is still alive.
I don't want anything.
What did you tell Tom about the job?
I didn't know that Tom talked about me.
How can people do things like this?
There is a small pond in our garden.
Don't you have any other way of contacting Tom?
The vampire movie filled them with terror.
"I miss Tom, too."
"I'm sorry, but my mother is out at the moment."
I always get up early.
How long are you going to stay here?
You should give up drinking and smoking.
Who allowed him in?
I wasn't here then.
I'll give you a good price.
"You are a professional, but I am an amateur."
I believe Tom can take care of himself.
Tom thought Mary was bored.
They're working hard to get the cable laid in time.
You'd better bandage the wound at once.
Are you going to eat that?
Why are you lying?
Someone tried to kill Tom.
I hate people who talk like that.
I haven't finished eating.
I never leave home without it.
What is this?
Tom was missing.
Thanks for voting for me.
Tom taught Mary's children French.
God bless you!
I've got nothing to give you.
I don't think that Tom is guilty.
I have nothing to do with their troubles.
Why can't you answer any of my questions?
Tom never takes off his sunglasses.
I'm sure that that won't happen.
That's the reason I bought this book.
"I need some paper, pencils, ink and so on."
He died in his bed.
I took the wheels off my bicycle.
Tom is evidently sick.
I'm a musician.
Tom said that he didn't know any French.
Where can I claim my luggage?
"To get good at something, you have to practice."
Thank you in advance.
We must not complain.
Do you have a better explanation?
Where's my other sock?
What would've happened to me if I'd done that?
"Tom is married, isn't he?"
Tom used to spend a lot of time with his grandparents.
I don't know why that happened.
I think that it'll rain.
I've been shopping all day.
Stay with me.
Tom has a lot to do.
I wonder whether Tom is really in Australia.
I'm happy with what I've got.
Who do you think they were?
Tom lost his footing and fell into the water.
I'm sure Tom will be able to win.
I don't like taking care of the garden.
He was in agony.
I think Tom would've stayed longer if he could've.
I left a message for Tom.
Tom and his friends discussed politics all night.
"You like soccer, don't you?"
When will they start logging?
I hope you're hungry.
Tell Tom I'll be there in three minutes.
Do you want to learn how to drive?
This is wrong.
Somebody's got to tell Tom what to do.
I will buy a watch at the store.
Tom broke the record.
I had trouble opening the window.
It's you who doesn't understand.
I've been accused of murder.
It's getting dark. I wonder if it's going to rain.
Speak to me in French.
Tom's right eye is twitching again.
Tom borrowed money from Mary's father.
I'm incorrect.
Why does that even matter?
It's too high.
I won't do that without you.
Is there any way we can help you?
What time did you get up this morning?
"Sorry, I don't follow."
Tom is a student at the university where I used to teach.
I'm going to need some more time.
Tom is about the same age as Mary.
Tom and Mary are gone.
The governor ordered an investigation.
Tom suddenly felt tired.
Do you think I don't know that?
Did you talk to Tom on Monday?
Tom is intrigued.
Do we even have a choice?
I get what I want.
Didn't you know Tom was going to Australia?
You don't seem to be having any problem.
We can rely on Tom.
Why did they do it?
I'd like to go abroad one day.
"Forget about it, OK?"
I'm going to fix this.
We'll all miss you.
The rich are not always happy.
Tom's birthday was the day before yesterday.
Have you found out who did that?
Americans vote for a new president every four years.
It's not the first time.
There are signs of growing tensions between the two countries.
I took the photo.
I wanted to say goodbye.
I don't need a bed.
You may come if you like.
I can't get the door unlocked.
Tom needs you.
You have a right to know about what happened.
Tom and I are cousins.
Tom brought us gifts.
Didn't you know that Tom wanted to do that?
Tom has already promised to do that.
I've never asked you for anything.
I think I would like that.
Those who violate the rules will be punished.
Does Tom want this?
"I am from Hiroshima, but now I live in Tokyo."
Is this your first visit to Australia?
He snored all night and his wife couldn't sleep.
"If I have time, I'll drop by."
What are you planning to do for the New Year vacation?
I have terrible pains.
This company sold unsafe products.
I made an appointment with Tom.
How soon will you be ready to leave?
I've lost my glasses.
Tom was so cold his teeth were chattering.
"Yeah, that's what I'd do."
Have you got plans?
She's gonna kill me.
"When your husband finds out, he won't be happy."
Tom called 911.
Tom won't go with you.
I'm glad you're coming.
I was dreaming about you.
Do you drink coffee every morning?
Eat it.
I forgot to lock my door.
Don't feed the pigeons.
You're not alone.
You should call Tom right now.
I have to help.
I bought an old car.
I think you were wrong.
You're not going to like what I'm about to say.
It's contagious.
Tom thought Mary was happy.
Tom went to the park by himself.
Why didn't you let Tom talk to Mary?
We can't talk here.
Tom knows what Mary is going to do.
I will be free in ten minutes.
It went OK.
Why are you accusing me?
She thanked him for his kindness.
You'll find nothing here.
Tom walks to school every day.
Which book did Tom choose?
Where's the blanket?
Tell me what you've got.
How do I know you're not lying to me right now?
It's not easy to please Tom.
Don't let the dog inside.
Tom said Mary may return on Monday.
I got into the boat.
I suspect Tom didn't really want to do that.
A lot of people are hypocritical.
"Tom tried to sell me his old car, but I told him I wasn't interested."
He stood on the surface of the moon.
Tom didn't have to tell anybody anything.
I made coffee.
I want you to know I'll always love you.
Tom got hit by a bus.
Let's wait for Tom here.
Many sailors can't swim.
Didn't you know that Tom and Mary were planning to get married?
What time do you usually eat supper?
Tom was a car salesman.
Why are you always so suspicious?
We named my son after my grandfather.
It's better not to go there.
I taught in Boston.
You're ignoring me.
We met in Boston.
How do I know you're not bluffing?
She hit upon a good idea.
We'll have to try it again.
I wanted to make sure you were here.
There is a car in front of the church.
Tom told Mary that his brother's name was John.
Did you hear a knock?
You do work a lot.
Why were you absent from school yesterday?
How kind of you!
Tom had a sharp pain in his right hand.
Where is the rubber duck?
Why don't you ask Tom yourself?
Which book is yours?
Foxes are wild animals.
I knew you'd never let Tom die.
Tom's room wasn't clean.
I'm a volunteer.
Tom isn't currently living in Australia.
Was it a lie when you said you loved me?
Please save a seat for me.
Who will write the report?
I didn't know where it came from.
I dropped the vase and it broke.
She avoids me.
You look bad.
Didn't you know that I was from Australia?
Tom doesn't shave.
Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do what John has told her to do.
Do you want some company?
Remember it.
I think we'd better leave early.
Everybody likes polite people.
When did you buy your car?
How can you be sure of that?
Tom asked me to pass him the salt and pepper.
I can't imagine how I'd feel in Tom's shoes.
I was hoping you'd be there.
This tastes very good.
Life is not fair. Get used to it.
My father came home at nine.
Don't you want to know why I did that?
Tom handed Mary her purse.
I don't think Tom knows when Mary will visit Boston.
Tomorrow morning Tom and I are leaving Boston.
Is it black?
I'm going to tell Tom.
Tom asked me whether I liked Mary or not.
Tom doesn't want me to help you.
She's unconscious.
I am sorry to have kept you waiting.
I need mine.
What does this mean to you?
I know that you were in Boston last weekend.
Tom's hair is very long.
I'm not saying this is your fault.
Tom allowed me to go.
He made up his mind.
I told Tom that I wouldn't help him.
This plant is edible.
Tom is a nonsmoker.
Will you come and see me?
Do you have any sons?
I'm delighted to meet you.
Tom painted the barn red.
Tom is writing a letter to Mary now.
It was selfish of me.
I lived in Australia for three years.
I should probably be writing this down.
I think you're the only one who believes Tom.
Get out of my office.
What happens next time?
I'll know better next time.
"Get a bicycle. You will not regret it, if you live."
Tell Tom we don't want to go.
Why do turtles have shells?
What happened at that intersection?
I have a list here.
Do you have anything planned for tomorrow?
My university has a dorm.
Do you like looking at yourself in the mirror?
I saw Tom in the library yesterday.
What time did you go to bed yesterday?
Tom usually doesn't buy expensive clothes.
I didn't make any promises.
Close the door after you when you leave the room.
"You don't trust me, do you?"
Tom will catch us.
I'm sure you're wrong.
Cows give us milk and chickens give us eggs.
I apologize for the mistake.
Do you want to look at this?
"You want me to go, don't you?"
I'm glad you were able to come.
Is Tom Canadian?
I didn't speak with Tom.
I was never told that.
Tom has been trying to get rid of the mice in his house.
Go on board.
I've never flown a plane.
She married a rich old man.
They made me captain.
Tom turned on the windshield wipers.
We're better than you.
We know so little about Tom.
I know I can make it.
Give Tom something to eat.
I didn't get tired.
I told you Tom would win.
She is popular with other girls.
Tom told me he spoke French.
Tom has many hobbies.
Tom wanted to bring home a souvenir.
Promise me you'll never do that again.
I can handle it.
I'm already sick.
The research director had the department do a thorough job in testing the new product.
Do you want me to pick you up?
What should I do with all this stuff?
He lost his eyesight in an accident.
It was a coincidence.
You have only yourself to blame.
Tom skinned his knee.
I'll send you a picture.
I knew you wouldn't believe me.
Tom is twice as old as Mary.
Victims of the hurricane received financial aid from the government.
I have a good sense of smell.
Can you use a computer?
I'm not interested in your excuses.
That's not for Tom.
Tom followed Mary's advice.
Spring has come early this year.
I have no intention whatever of resigning.
I know this is my own fault.
They were crying.
Swimming at night is dangerous.
Your passport photo doesn't look anything like you.
It was a beautiful wedding ceremony.
He looked back.
Tom said he'd do that for free.
Tom showed Mary my picture.
I had a headache.
I don't want Tom to forget.
I hate you.
You promised me.
I want them to be my friends.
I didn't even know Tom used to live in Boston.
I ran like lightning.
There's nobody in your room.
There was nothing that Tom could do about it.
I feel listless and have a throbbing headache.
It's rather cold for April.
Everyone smiled at Tom.
I got up too early.
I live in this neighborhood.
You are kidding me.
Tom needs help now.
I regret not having taken his advice.
It happened while I wasn't looking.
She's a successful businesswoman.
Why are you awake?
I thought Tom just needed some more time.
I am picking apples.
I came here to talk to you.
You're so impatient.
I'm so excited.
Don't you know it's rude to ask a lady her age?
I don't have time to do that.
Do you think in French?
Buy Tom a drink.
That's so mean.
Were there any other survivors?
I shouldn't've told you.
I have no idea why Tom quit his job.
I know you were giving Tom money.
You never change.
The game was postponed until next Sunday.
It's dark in the basement.
What kind of proof do you need?
Is Tom awake?
They were rescued by helicopter.
I think that's a good plan.
She worries about my health.
Anybody here?
You shouldn't see her now.
I don't think that Tom knows what Mary needs to do.
Tom was tired and hungry.
She first met him in Boston.
Don't do something you'll regret later.
I didn't want to disturb the patients.
I'm 100 percent sure of that.
Look what we've found.
What do your sisters do?
This coin will bring you good luck.
Tom cut the tree down.
All of my brothers died in the war.
I have something to talk to you about.
I'm not too surprised.
Somebody has broken into my house.
I'm going to go take a shower.
Don't be long.
Tom said this movie wasn't very good.
Let's get out of this place.
Tom needs to sleep more.
I'm waiting for the ferry.
Can you forgive me?
Tom is an influential local criminal.
Tom was here when I got home.
Tom says he doesn't know where Mary bought her pearl necklace.
He is an evil man.
I almost gave up.
I knew you'd need to do that.
I would like your picture.
This lion is very tame.
I need to talk to you in private.
Tom and Mary have helped me.
It was nearly noon.
Is Tom on the boat?
Tom went to the dentist.
I can't believe I'm doing this again.
The enemies stood face to face.
Are you trying to blackmail me?
I was asleep from one to four this afternoon.
A real friend would tell us the truth.
What job experience do you have?
We believed you.
I knew you'd show me how to do that.
I tied my dog to a tree in the garden.
I have a friend who lives in America.
My brother plays guitar.
Nothing's good enough for you.
I don't like her.
It was dark under the bridge.
How do you think Tom knew that?
What did you and Tom have for lunch?
Tom didn't need to help.
Call me anytime.
I had to shoot my horse because he was in a lot of pain.
"Call me when you get there, so I know you're safe."
I have an assistant.
Tom almost always agrees with Mary.
"I want you to meet my friend, Tom."
He's about the same age as you are.
He is devoid of human feeling.
We're reasonable.
Are you going home?
This has nothing to do with you.
Can you stay a bit longer?
I wonder who wrote this note.
Who did you go there with?
Tom and Mary both know that that's unlikely to happen.
I very seldom go to bed before midnight.
What subjects do you study at school?
Tom didn't come because he got sick.
I can't believe you remembered.
I'm just lazy.
Kamal hasn't read the book yet.
I could ask you the same question.
Tom didn't have to do this.
I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend.
It's just across the street from the church.
You'll enjoy working here.
"Whether we like it or not, we have to go there."
Tom got into the elevator.
Everett spoke for almost two hours.
Tom has already decided not to do that.
That sounds amazing.
Nobody could say no to Tom.
There were about one thousand people.
I can't understand why she doesn't love me anymore.
I didn't know that Tom was that old.
Didn't you hear what I just told you?
I've asked myself that question a hundred times.
"Above all, be patient."
I want something to eat.
"He heard a strange noise, so he jumped out of bed."
It cost me a lot of money to build a new house.
Tom carefully cut the tissue with scissors.
They work together very well.
I know that you're conservative.
Did you speak?
He is considered one of the greatest scientists in our country.
Tom has an incurable disease.
The car is blue.
What year were you born?
It was 36 degrees in Boston today.
Tom has to give Mary something.
I'm too late.
The princess lives in a large castle.
May I call on you today?
I still have some things to do.
Let me show you some pictures.
That's the ugliest snowman I've ever seen.
When was the last time you asked somebody for help?
I'd like to drink some tea or coffee.
Leave our house.
She has never seen it before.
I had to see Tom.
Is Tom going with you?
I'm alone with Tom.
Tom thought it was rude to talk to Mary the way John did.
He works for a big newspaper with a very large circulation.
You're needed here.
I've thought of that.
Are you punctual?
We prepared for an attack.
I'm much younger than you.
I'm not sure I can help you.
I think we should start making plans for the summer.
I've made a mistake.
"Do you have a cell phone, Tom?"
This one is for us.
We both won.
Tom has promised to come.
"If you don't do that, I won't do that either."
We're not in Boston.
Tom doesn't like to speak in public.
We can't continue without Tom.
I can understand French.
I've already explained everything.
Mary was wearing a sleeveless summer dress.
All the children fell asleep before it got dark.
"Are you, by any chance, afraid of me?"
Someone stepped on my foot on the train.
There's no salt.
Tom isn't scrawny.
Is anyone going to eat that?
Go see Tom.
I can show you how to do that.
I have a cat and a dog.
Are you leaving?
I don't think that Tom can help us now.
It's almost three hundred miles to Boston from here.
I would've drowned if you hadn't saved me.
Don't waste so much food.
Tom said he was going to marry Mary.
There weren't any kids in the park.
I'll get in touch with you soon.
CO₂ has a lot to do with the so-called greenhouse effect.
Are you at home now?
I know Tom doesn't know who I am.
Tom was very happy here.
The problem is we don't know who Tom is.
I tried to cheer him up.
Hand me the wrench.
Didn't you know that Tom was living in Boston?
She was in America last month.
I ought to have attended the lecture.
Tom built a doghouse yesterday.
He offered his seat to an old woman.
Nobody knows why Tom did that.
You're acting weird.
She thanked me for the present.
Tom doesn't read anything.
How can people do things like this?
Do you know whose snowboard this is?
Tom is nodding.
The motorcade made its way down Park Street.
Her father didn't allow her to go to movies alone.
Tom has a big appetite.
Why don't we just agree to disagree?
He was loved by everybody.
What were they doing?
I can still see you.
He isn't here now.
Tom said you knew about it.
Tom will try to escape.
Who said you were going to die?
She has dry hair.
I haven't seen Tom today.
"Tom can speak French, can't he?"
I've had a great time in Australia.
I don't like you very much.
Don't ask me how it works.
I asked Tom to stop doing that.
We no longer live in Boston.
We will go on a picnic if it is fine tomorrow.
I never really liked you.
Tom says that he loves Mary.
He is practically dead.
I can't believe you're giving up.
Tom doesn't live with his parents.
Hundreds of people were killed.
It'd be impossible.
I want to see you again.
Tom is easy to live with.
I don't have enough money for a taxi.
How will you be spending Christmas?
Tom chickened out.
I need to show you something.
Tom never paid me.
Where can I park the car?
Don't be afraid of making mistakes.
I'm not a monster.
The snow has finally melted.
No one could tell where she was.
Nobody told me Tom would be here.
Look what you've done to me.
Don't raise your voice.
I think that things like this happen by chance.
Tom said he couldn't remember that guy's name.
I didn't know Tom was afraid of ghosts.
You need to talk to Tom.
I like stories that have sad endings.
Don't look out the window.
Did you really do this all by yourself?
I don't like the idea much.
Tom erased the sentence and rewrote it.
The submarines sank a lot of ships.
Where are we going now?
There's no turning back.
Didn't you know that Tom lived in Boston when he was a child?
Sit down and shut up.
It was delicious.
We're going to have to work together.
Tell Tom I don't have his money.
Tom wanted to get rich quick.
You can't give up.
Didn't you know Tom lived in Australia when he was a kid?
Tom thinks only of himself.
We shouldn't to go there today.
Try telling that to Tom.
Only part of the building has been destroyed by the earthquake.
Tom knew there were risks.
Let's go out.
I know you can do better.
Start writing.
Which of the boys did that?
Tom can't figure out how to get the box open.
I'm a freshman.
I refused to believe it.
She left the room.
I've always been fat.
I've got as much money as he has.
Tom does not look happy.
You can say whatever you like.
They've changed a lot.
Many roads and fields were flooded.
There's no milk left.
It's dangerous to dive in shallow water.
How was everything?
"Which do you like better, dogs or cats?"
I didn't know that you were so old.
She came into the room.
Tom is a child at heart.
Tom gave me his old one.
When are you going to finish this?
I knew you'd take Tom's side.
Put your clothes on.
I don't need a counselor.
"If it were true, what would you do?"
It seems it'll rain tomorrow.
You have to leave immediately.
I didn't think you'd ever speak to me again.
"Tom tried to open the door, but he couldn't."
I hope neither of them was injured in the crash.
I put on Tom's shirt by mistake.
Don't lean on my desk.
Bus rates have stayed the same for two years.
Do you have an appointment with him?
That's not a good sign.
Come quickly. It's urgent.
"Tom is so different from John, isn't he?"
He smiles every time I see him.
Let's figure this out.
Pass your plate and I'll give you some more meat.
How many politicians do you personally know?
I said I'd think about it.
Tom has since apologized.
Tom doesn't have to apologize to Mary.
Do you want to skip class?
I want to know what happened.
I have to do this.
Don't you feel anything for Tom?
Are you sure this is the spot?
"Tom might be here somewhere, but I haven't seen him."
Tom motioned for me to leave the room.
Tom unhooked the fish and released it back into the water.
"Tom would like to become an architect, like his father."
What do you want your wedding to be like?
We had lunch together.
I'm tired from lack of sleep.
I used to sing in a choir.
Tom didn't seem sick.
She wasn't able to open the bottle.
I have to stop.
We were both slightly embarrassed.
I have seen that girl before.
That's our train.
Tom thought Mary had died.
That's not what you told me yesterday.
Tell me why you want to go there.
Tom stabbed her.
This is the kind of music I like.
Tom didn't want to get into trouble.
Did Tom break something again?
He did it out of curiosity.
Tom couldn't go on the picnic with us today because he had an important business meeting.
Tom always sleeps hugging his teddy bear.
I still have a lot of time.
I didn't unlock that door.
He is not the shy boy he used to be.
The roof is covered with sheet metal.
Do you plan to do that?
My coat wasn't expensive.
My sight isn't as good as it used to be.
Please lend me your knife.
He went up the steps slowly.
You know I won't do that.
I'm not your daughter.
I thought you didn't want anything to eat.
Tom lit a candle.
Let me think a minute.
I slipped and fell.
Tom and Mary are best friends.
We have to do something with it.
Did you plant this yourself?
I'm sure that's not correct.
Tom often talks about golf.
I lost my temper.
I am leaving for the United States tomorrow.
We bought a round table.
"It doesn't make much sense to me that Tom would be allowed to go, but Mary wouldn't be."
You must be kind to old people.
I want you to have a copy of this.
Tom always checks to verify that no dyes are in any food he buys.
Don't talk to Tom about this.
It's raining in Boston.
I don't know what it means.
I'm afraid you can't go there.
Didn't you know Tom was rich?
You said you'd help us.
Tom went to prison for selling drugs.
How do you like your new French teacher?
Can you complete the job in two days?
It hurts terribly.
Tom doesn't want to go outside on a cold day like this.
Stick with it and you'll succeed.
I want to go abroad.
"You often speak French with your friends, don't you?"
Churches are designated on the map with crosses.
I won't sleep in this room.
I'd rather not speak French.
Maybe Tom forgot to do that.
Tom may be the best person for the job.
I got into the boat.
I want orange juice.
You've dialed the wrong number.
It seldom snows here in the winter.
We must develop a plan.
Didn't you read the book?
You can't understand.
He wouldn't let anyone interfere in his personal affairs.
I come home at 2:30 on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
Is this your first time in Korea?
I'm pretty sure that Tom doesn't like Mary.
Both of us knew that that would happen.
It's not likely to snow today.
My plan didn't work.
We're running out of time.
Tom won the fight.
Are you annoyed by this?
Please show me another one.
What are you going to buy?
I'd like to clarify that.
You're lucky to have found each other.
You're the one who hired Tom.
There's no need to be afraid.
Do you think there's something wrong with me?
You're too young to join the army.
"I'm sorry, I don't know what to say."
"You don't know who Tom is, do you?"
He will join us later.
They settled on the terms of the contract.
Where do you plan to go for vacation?
Don't tell me to go home.
He already did that.
I don't understand what the teacher said.
Do you have to stay?
Don't walk home by yourself.
Bring Tom along.
Do you think I don't know what happened?
Why is no one here?
Tom hasn't washed the car yet.
Hurry or we'll be late.
I feel so sorry for Tom.
Tom cleaned out his bank accounts and disappeared.
I still have a lot of questions I want to ask you about your relationship with Tom.
I know Tom is taller than Mary is.
That is exactly what I wanted to buy.
She has finally recovered from her cold.
My uncle is the manager of this hotel.
Tom has already given me enough money.
The thought never crossed my mind.
Speak more slowly.
Doesn't that bolt seem loose?
Can you tell Tom to call me?
I can't sleep well.
Do you still have Tom's umbrella?
He has not realized his mistakes yet.
Tom will find out.
Negotiations are proceeding very slowly.
You're still my son.
I hate to complain.
There's something I want to talk to you about.
Tom put on his coat and left.
Where were you last night?
You're a rude person.
You shouldn't have gone into the forest alone.
We walked for a long time.
Tom is progressing in French.
I don't think that Tom knows where Mary bought her bicycle.
Do you want me to rub your shoulders?
I like hot coffee.
I'm prepared for that.
It's not polite to stare at others.
You can trust all of us.
Why did you say that to me?
I don't know who'll do that.
I was writing a letter when he came.
They're both empty.
I've baked a cake for Tom.
Tom didn't want to be helped.
I've never seen you like this before.
Tom could pass for a teenager.
Tom cheated.
Tell Tom what Mary did.
I am visiting my friends.
I drove Tom to school.
I guess this desk will serve the purpose until we can get a new one.
Mind your own business.
Tom usually walks with a cane.
I didn't think that Tom could help me with that.
Tom didn't say that.
I forgot to tell Tom and Mary to bring their lunch.
Don't ask me to explain it.
Is any of this true?
Did I wake you up?
There were no eyewitnesses.
I've got nothing to say to you.
I received your letter yesterday.
Tom has a meeting tomorrow.
Wait for your sister.
I saw the boat sink.
Tom is a son of a policeman.
"Where's your book? ""On the table."""
She is not as beautiful as she was before.
I'm very modest.
I didn't think I'd be able to do that.
We need to get you to a hospital.
Tom regrets doing that.
Didn't you hear me call?
Do you want some coffee?
Are you sure that you want to do this?
Tom said that I looked terrible.
Every word in this dictionary is important.
"The train was on time today, as always."
Tom suggested that we try doing this a different way.
You don't look very well. Are you OK?
Sometimes I see him at the club.
I'm glad that I didn't buy something like this.
We'll go to Boston and Chicago.
Do you have jeans in my size?
"You like fruit, don't you?"
I wouldn't help Tom if I were you.
I did what was necessary.
Who is the man that you were talking with?
Tom ordered a bottle of champagne.
Tom and Mary were engaged.
Don't try to fool me.
I wasn't sure you'd like that.
Do you know why he couldn't come?
He has something to do with the robbery.
I won't do that. I'd rather die.
Tom's mother is such a gossip.
He selected a Christmas gift for her.
I had to work late.
There is no bus service to the village.
I know that Tom wants to see you.
I don't think that Tom heard you.
Learning Korean is difficult.
I don't want to hear that word.
He'll be busy tomorrow.
I'll be leaving in March.
Put down the knife.
I knew I was going to be punished.
I know who they are.
Take that away.
I'm glad you called.
You are the doctor.
Why did you switch the light off?
Tom is going to need that.
Tom said he couldn't remember his own phone number.
Tom smells horrible.
Haven't you two already talked?
I knew that Tom was older than Mary.
Aren't you supposed to be at work?
I have the solution.
What would the world be like without women?
I want you to leave my house and never come back.
I knew we couldn't trust Tom.
Have you found Tom?
I prefer speaking French.
The noise didn't bother Tom.
Time passed very slowly this week.
He is not at all a gentleman.
These are for Tom.
"Whose cats are these? ""They are Fatima's."""
We can do that ourselves.
Tom didn't have a gun.
Tom is waiting for the bus.
What did you think?
I don't think that it's worth it.
A cheetah runs as fast as any animal.
Tom can't stand you.
Can I borrow yours?
Tom told me to leave.
I knew you'd find me.
Tom has already phoned me three times today.
Everyone can see it now.
Tom doesn't want to pay in cash.
I want to see it.
I'm the only one here who can do that.
What did he not buy?
I did my homework yesterday.
Didn't I warn you?
Did you hear me?
My brother looks very similar to me.
"If I can do that, so can you."
He's short and fat.
Mary asked Tom to shave off his beard.
That wasn't funny.
Tom handed Mary his keys.
Buffaloes have big horns.
You don't need to wait for me.
They all deserve to die.
There's a way to do it.
I think you know everyone here.
Do you know who invented the Ferris wheel?
Paper burns quickly.
I don't want what I'm about to say to be recorded.
Do you think such a thing is possible?
I asked Tom to help.
I didn't know Tom was alone.
Tom wasn't the one who was driving.
He has a beautiful tan.
I am amazed at your audacity.
This newspaper has a wide circulation.
I was the only one who didn't fall into the trap.
Where can I buy coffee?
I've missed you very much.
"Well, tell me what you know."
Tom has chosen me.
Have you really lost your wallet again?
I signed the contract.
Tom is taking a nap.
Why aren't you studying French?
Guess who Tom's French teacher was?
I want to send my baggage on ahead.
He asked me when I was going to buy a new car.
There are a lot of trees around the pond.
I must have it shortened.
Tom thought Mary was jealous.
Can you find her?
They forced me to sign my name.
"If Tom can do that, so can you."
Tom often wears jeans.
It took me more than three hours to translate that report into French.
It's awesome.
It was obvious that Tom didn't want to leave.
Are you speaking to me?
I want you to eat.
She was busy.
I didn't know that you were such a superstitious person.
I'm always the first to arrive.
How's your brother?
This one's yours.
I think that they were all fired.
Tom told me the story of his life.
What did you find out?
Tom seems to be nice.
It's just awful.
We should've bought three bottles of wine.
"Tom, we've been through this before."
What's your favorite memory from childhood?
What do you want?
Your suitcase is heavier than mine.
Tom is out digging in the cabbage patch.
You were sick.
I stole it from Tom.
I think you did great.
I have a splitting headache.
You're just like your father.
May I switch off the light?
The store has enough shoes on hand to supply any normal demand.
We know where you were.
Both Tom and Mary were born in Boston.
Tom fell flat on his face.
He wrote a letter yesterday.
I've decided that we won't go.
Why did you like it?
"If Tom comes, give him this."
The way Tom talks annoys me.
Tom returned to the living room.
Can your mother drive a car?
She takes piano lessons once a week.
I saw Tom and Mary.
I cannot start till six o'clock.
Do that again.
There's chocolate ice cream in the freezer.
Can I ask you why?
I'll be in the other room.
Would you like any dessert?
I asked Tom where he wanted to go.
Tom gave me the chicken pox.
You should call the police.
Tom has decided to go.
Tom got divorced again.
Tom hardly ever loses at chess.
Tom and Mary are ready.
I was in Boston about a month ago.
Tell me who hurt you.
Do you know of a good French restaurant?
"Tom, wake up."
Tom seems courteous.
I wonder why Tom hasn't called.
I thought Tom would bring us something to eat.
We used a barrel for a makeshift table.
It's not too late for you.
I don't know Boston that well.
Tom isn't a good person.
Is Tom's illness serious?
I have no money to pay for the bus.
I'll act as a guide for you.
The couple was walking arm in arm.
Tom could not take his eyes off of Mary.
Tom can't talk with you now.
Come back as soon as possible.
Tom owes Mary slightly over a thousand dollars.
Auckland is a city in New Zealand.
I'm not as tired as Tom.
Tom and I have been married for a long time.
We have to start.
There's so much I want to show you.
Tom fell asleep with his clothes on.
Why don't you go inside?
Try and find out when the train leaves.
Give me time.
I can't answer the phone now.
Tom carefully closed the door.
"If you give me Tom's phone number, I'll call him."
I knew you wouldn't believe me.
I found the diary that my father kept for 30 years.
Nobody lives there.
Are you telling me it's my fault?
Tom is simple.
You look ugly.
I fell asleep while I was doing that.
What's it called again?
There's no membership fee for joining.
I study French an hour every day.
I'm worried about my weight.
I'm ordering you to leave immediately.
Tom was sentenced to three weeks of community service.
Our cow doesn't give us any milk.
Tom refused to answer.
Everything is OK. Don't worry.
We're both right.
We can't leave now.
Tom has a small farm just outside of Boston.
Do you often borrow Tom's car?
"How did that go? ""Not well."""
Can you call Tom?
I should've listened to you.
Is the horse black?
You'll soon be used to living in a big city.
You've been given a second chance.
Tom asked Mary to do that for us.
Tom kept his promise.
Tom has three brothers.
The book fell to the floor.
How did Tom lose all his money?
I broke the lock opening the door.
Tom likes playing chess.
You knew I was here.
I'll pay for lunch.
I hope you have insurance.
Do you think the police will ever find out who killed Tom?
Would you like for me to make you something to eat?
"Just water, please."
Does anyone in your family smoke?
Are you sure it was a ghost?
"Tom is going to be fired, isn't he?"
A girl asked Tom to dance.
Mary knitted Tom a new pair of socks.
Tom's house is at least twice as big as mine.
I don't want you to tell this to anybody.
Choose the T-shirt you like the best.
You have to share the cake equally.
Tom is still too young to drink beer.
I've always lived in Boston.
I'm surprised you came at all.
Can I begin?
That's not how that word is pronounced.
This is the only thing I care about.
You're undependable.
Tom bit me.
He's anxious about his examination result.
They don't pay me enough.
I could pick you up on my way to work.
Tom knows me very well.
It is easy to solve the problem.
Tom is moving to Boston.
They'll do what I tell them to do.
I'm going to watch the baseball game tonight.
I did it for Tom.
"Live and let live, is Tom's philosophy of life."
"Tom clicked a button on his remote, but nothing happened."
Luckily Tom didn't see Mary.
Tom needed money.
Tom knows all that.
We haven't finished eating the watermelon yet.
Tell Tom I've broken a leg.
This is a valid point of view.
Everyone in town is gossiping about us.
You look very happy.
Did Tom say anything else?
What do you think about this plan?
I know all your songs by heart.
They have to clean the room.
I think it's highly unlikely that I'll ever see my stolen motorcycle again.
I sleep at night now.
Open the drapes.
I'm retired.
You always make the same mistake.
The cat caught the rats.
Do you want to stay?
You can see it with the naked eye.
Tom has already been told to leave Mary alone.
Get on the horse.
Tom will be upset if he doesn't win.
Aren't I right?
Tom did that eventually.
Tom didn't recognize the truck driver.
"Where is my classroom? ""It's on the third floor."""
I'll answer all of your questions.
Tom tried again.
Tom is the happiest person I know.
Has Tom forgiven us?
"Well, what did you expect?"
Tom avoided answering my question.
I know Tom will be prudent.
I don't care what you think anymore.
Tom hasn't lived abroad.
We have to find more chairs.
Tom is doing well now.
I'm going to live alone.
Is it painful?
I'd like to have a little chat with you.
Tom isn't upset.
This rule cannot be applied to every case.
Don't let Tom find out about that.
Washing clothes is my work.
I understand how you felt.
I should get there before 2:30.
Tom put on his sweater inside out.
That's against the law.
Do either of you need anything?
Tom didn't say how much it cost.
Don't lie to Tom.
I want to buy them all.
Tom is reading a novel by Sidney Sheldon now.
Keep warm.
I think French is difficult.
I'm not going to bite you.
We won't have class next week.
The cost will run into thousands of dollars.
I think you know that's not true.
We are leaving Japan tomorrow morning.
How many boys are in this class?
You're the love of my life.
I don't know yet.
I hope you can do that.
Do you want to join us?
Tom told everyone that he thought Mary would make a good wife for someone someday.
I want to make her acquaintance.
I want bread and jam.
It's no use arguing with Tom.
Do you think that Tom will let me do that?
Tom hasn't had much education.
My mother bought me two pairs of pants last Sunday.
I haven't been to Australia.
I don't think Tom knows that.
I've never hallucinated.
Did you have a good time?
Tom's Canadian.
I'm not sure what happened.
Let's stay here.
I don't want to live my life in fear.
No one deserves that.
That hat is too small for you.
Tom stood in front of Mary.
Don't worry. There's nothing wrong with you.
Mr. Jackson is going to be our French teacher next year.
Tom is the best candidate for the job.
Tom discovered that he had run out of money.
When does the bus leave?
There's something important that Tom didn't tell us.
Tom asked me how old I was.
Carrots are good for your eyes.
Is Tom playing tennis?
I have a cough.
Don't even joke about it.
I've never climbed this mountain.
"They're Canadians, aren't they?"
I can't run because I'm very tired.
Don't ever doubt it.
I told Tom not to shout.
I'm very glad to see you.
Tom's lack of knowledge was obvious.
"Stop doing that, please."
It's a very delicate matter.
Travel is one of the better forms of education.
This is just the beginning.
I didn't take my shoes off.
Let's talk a bit about that.
Please tell me how to pronounce this word.
I don't think I can help you on Monday.
I'm not sure what time the concert is going to start.
You must believe me.
Tom is an exceptional person.
"As far as I know, Tom has never lied to me."
Would you like to switch seats?
Tom didn't agree to help.
I'm not speculating.
The book is for me; the flowers are for you.
Don't cut that wire.
"If you don't want to go, fine."
I'll be completely honest.
I'll tell Tom about that the next time I talk to him.
Have you met anyone else?
We make mistakes.
I'm a singer.
Do you know it?
How much money do you want to earn?
No one can deny that.
Tom said that he could swim well.
Promise me you'll never do that again.
That's not what I meant. I'm sorry.
A million thoughts raced through Tom's mind.
How serious is this problem?
Tom begged Mary for another chance.
I don't usually cry.
"I saw that, too."
I invited Tom to my house.
Tom can't just do anything he wants.
I would never have guessed that Tom couldn't swim.
I'll never forget what you did.
I'd better go look for Tom.
Only do what Tom tells you.
Why were you at the restaurant?
I know that Tom was surprised.
Cut the potatoes.
I must speak to you in private.
Everyone may go home.
I don't remember giving Tom a key.
"You were exaggerating, weren't you?"
Tom wears ties.
We have to go now.
Many people think I'm crazy.
Go to your room now!
I just want to make sure that you're prepared.
Is that your book?
The cats are meowing.
What's your major?
Tom and John were on the same basketball team.
They felt that now was not the time to start a civil war.
I didn't lie to you.
Tom is wounded.
You can tell me the truth.
Tom took out his cell phone so that he could take a selfie.
Tell us about your plan.
There is a man by the side of the pond.
I want to take your temperature.
I wish I could drive.
We don't like to talk about Tom.
Swimming is good for your health.
He is in trouble now.
Tom sold us out.
I poured myself a cup of coffee.
I can do without this.
I saw that tonight.
Tom and Mary killed time playing chess.
Is that healthy?
You'll lose.
I'd like to spend the rest of my life with you.
Your reputation precedes you.
We wouldn't be in this mess if you'd just done what I told you.
Here comes the train.
When did you start having trouble with Tom?
No one in my family is sick.
You're really gifted.
They're experimenting with a new car.
"Hurry, or you'll miss the train."
The situation has become hopeless.
Is that why you want to kill me?
We've got a long climb ahead of us.
Tom thought I was serious.
Who's with Tom?
How much sugar did you buy?
Breakfast is served.
That incident happened right in front of him.
Write an answer.
Do you work in Boston?
I wore a beautiful dress.
I broke up with her.
We're back to square one.
You won't be able find Tom.
Here's one of my favorites.
I'm a geologist.
Do you think Tom made a good decision?
Please answer the question.
I hope your dreams come true.
I am a married man.
Shall I give you something to read?
Tom told me he owed Mary money.
A wooden building can easily catch fire.
You aren't even trying.
I can't be here anymore.
I have a pen.
Tom made many mistakes.
Is Tom your name?
I watched Tom do that.
I thought you'd want to see this movie.
Back up your files.
Tom and Mary have been talking to each other all morning.
Tom is going to help you.
I'll talk to Tom later about this.
You took the cookies out of the oven too soon.
I changed my clothes.
Tom denied having said such a thing.
I know things you don't know.
Didn't you know that Tom was going to be in Boston all week?
He was burning the candle at both ends.
Tom was in Boston last weekend.
I will stay home if it rains tomorrow.
I figured I could be of some help.
I'm reading a book.
No one will know.
Tom quit his job last month.
Tom told me how to do it.
Tom needs to pay more attention in class.
I don't think Tom knows when Mary came to Boston.
Please come by 2:30.
Mary clobbered Tom with a skillet.
Tom is a dangerous guy.
It seems that something is wrong with this car.
The meeting was canceled.
I have to find a way to help Tom.
We have work to do.
Tom asked for help.
I'd like to sit by the window.
We weren't expecting you so soon.
Tom told everyone I was adopted.
We should lower our voices.
I cried on his shoulder.
"He went there, never to return."
Tom went on speaking French.
Tom has more questions.
She reads on average three or four books a week.
Can I sit beside you?
Did you make any mistakes?
That has happened before.
Tom had nothing else to lose.
Tom has three computers.
I said don't do that.
The results were good.
What time does your plane leave tomorrow?
That kind of behavior isn't acceptable.
They're expecting you.
Mali is one of the poorest countries in Subsaharan Africa.
Have you missed me?
I want to know why I needed to do that.
Have you ever thought about commiting suicide?
I was dreaming.
The ship changed course.
He wants you to come home.
Please tell me where to put this.
That's why I left.
Put your weapon down.
"It'll cost about 10,000 yen."
Tom thought Mary would cry.
"Tom was born on May 5, 2010."
What you're asking us to do is impossible.
I saw Tom try to kill himself.
Let's do it.
Tom is in a good mood.
Tom realized he didn't have enough time to do what had to be done.
I intended to study medicine in America.
All you had to do was ask and I would have lent you as much money as you needed.
Tom and I apologized to each other.
How's your shoulder?
I need to check on something.
People can be cruel.
You may enter now.
We have three trees in our backyard.
This ought to cheer you up.
What inspired you to do that?
We had a drink of nice cool spring water.
I don't think it's that easy.
Tom heard footsteps.
Nothing bad happened to Tom.
What a heartwarming story!
The flowers in his garden have withered.
I need to borrow your car for a few hours.
Put that back where it belongs.
I want to tell you everything.
Tom wants to kill us.
It's in your bag.
We haven't yet decided what to do.
Please accept my sympathies.
Can I drive you home?
Are you still planning to marry Tom?
Tom must be found immediately.
You'll be my guests.
I don't think I understand you.
Tom looked a bit nervous.
Tom told me he saw Mary tonight.
I locked myself in the bathroom.
Tom told me about his plans.
We took a walk in the park.
The defense appealed the verdict.
Things will get easier from now on.
It's raining today.
Tom has curly hair.
I heard everything you just said.
Who is this money for?
That's not possible anymore.
We lost a lot of money.
This seems too good to be true.
I was filled with joy.
Tom hasn't written me back.
Tom and Mary depended on one another.
Tom will be here any second.
I didn't call Tom from Boston.
Is there anybody here who can help me?
That's exactly what I'd say.
Tom didn't get up before six.
What would you do in my place?
Tom did that carefully.
You can't be sure of that.
I wonder why we haven't heard from Tom yet.
"I don't want to do that, but I have to."
I thought it was very good.
I like buying clothes.
I don't think that I can find the time to do that.
Mary is my younger sister.
Tom admitted that he was jealous.
We must go back.
It's beyond my comprehension.
I'm a doctor now.
Was there anything else in the room?
Is it something I said?
Tom left home at 2:30.
It's pretty expensive.
There are some problems.
Tom won't be able to sell his car for that price.
Tom was killed by lightning.
Close the door.
Tom smiled thoughtfully.
Tom ate a slice of pizza.
It's dangerous to climb a mountain in bad weather.
Tom was unable to concentrate.
You're on the list.
Tom neither confirmed nor denied the rumors.
I know Tom will win.
Stop acting like an idiot.
Get out of there as soon as possible.
I want to talk to you after class.
How many songs have you written?
Tom handed Mary the broom.
Tom must be Mary's boyfriend.
I can't bear the pain anymore.
I don't think that Tom is busy now.
We both know why I'm here.
Get away from there.
Tom asked me if I liked basketball.
Tom and Mary moved to Boston three years ago.
What time do you usually eat lunch?
Don't blame Tom for this.
Do you know anyone here?
It's a very dangerous system.
I thought Tom said he liked this kind of music.
You're a bit taller than I am.
I forgot to tell you something.
I told Tom you were cold. He said he'd turn up the heat.
I asked Tom that very question.
I can't fix this.
They're vegetarians.
The event is on Monday.
Let the milk stand overnight and skim off the cream.
My uncle brought a new TV set for us.
You'll do just fine.
I don't care what will become of me.
I wish I had more friends.
Tom isn't the only Canadian here.
I knew Tom wouldn't do that.
Do what you like.
We have to change that.
"On February 14th, Americans celebrate Valentine's Day."
I feel better.
I want you to drive.
Tom can't say no.
Tom is John's twin.
Do you have any soft drinks?
I hope he isn't ill.
Athens is in Greece.
What do you like about Boston?
How long are you going to live in Boston?
Tom told me he couldn't speak French.
I don't know anything about Australia.
Tom said he wasn't busy.
By all means consider yourself invited.
We were just friends.
The temperature has suddenly dropped.
I'd like for you to do something for me.
I'll never forgive you.
Tom handed Mary his knife.
Do you mind if I turn off the light?
Tom doesn't speak French and Mary doesn't either.
We have a package here for Tom.
Let's light some candles.
Tom studied for the exam.
Watch your step. The stairs are steep.
Please charge this to my account.
A home is a once-in-a-lifetime purchase so you don't want to make any snap decisions.
I admit that he is right.
Good morning. It's time to get up.
Bring the frozen fish here.
So what should I do?
I prefer it this way.
Tom is hungry.
The express arrives at 6:30 p.m.
Did you leave the window open?
Please remember to write to her.
Tom smiled inwardly.
You know what I want you to do.
I wasn't honest with you.
The house is farther on.
Maybe eventually you'll decide you don't want to live here anymore.
What'll you do this weekend?
Tom was worried that something might happen to him.
I assume so.
I've lived here since I was a kid.
These are for Tom.
Drink it down.
You know her.
Tom can eat anything he wants.
I want you to turn off the radio.
I'll get you a gun.
Tom is a basketball player.
Leave the room.
How about calling it a day?
I knew you'd be here.
Did you have something to do with this?
I knew Tom wouldn't kiss you.
Japan's consumption of rice is decreasing.
Please turn on the light.
We know you lied about Tom.
Nothing will distract us.
You can stay with me.
He is chubby.
We were trying to keep that a secret.
Tom didn't like living in the city.
I've seen a lot of Tom recently.
The poor young man finally became a great artist.
Tom is in shock.
These are not words.
Tom is washing your car.
Come quickly.
Should I write that down?
I was able to find the book I was looking for.
I can lend you that book.
Are you going to arrest me?
Is it made of wood or metal?
It wasn't long.
What did you do with my book?
The children on the beach are building a sand castle.
I wanted to know where the voice was coming from.
What are you hinting at?
Have you slept?
Tom claimed that he saw a UFO.
Order me another one.
I'll never forgive you.
Why didn't Tom get on the bus?
We see a lot of cars on the street.
Where are your gloves?
Tom hates dogs.
We got something for Tom.
Which one do you like best?
Tom answered my question.
There are about 500 cattle on the ranch.
Why can't we do that today?
You can ask Tom.
I've decided to leave Boston.
Tom signed an NDA.
When was the last time you saw Tom?
I've lost my wallet.
Tom heard the front door slam.
I wonder why Tom isn't hungry.
You are a beautiful woman.
I've asked around and everybody says that we shouldn't trust you.
I'll help you find it.
That's pretty weird.
Why doesn't Tom come back?
Do you need help carrying anything?
This is a huge house.
Are you busy Friday night?
Tom was very hardworking.
He is able to swim like a fish.
Please keep it a secret.
Tom drove Mary to the hospital.
Tom can go tomorrow.
Tom looks scared.
Who told you all that?
Tom didn't let Mary in.
Please speak English.
You should've apologized to Tom for your rude behavior.
Tom hates curry.
Where were your children?
Tom is very kind to us.
Tom believes that's true.
When I grow up I want to be just like you.
"Look, I'm not an expert."
The government will have to deal with the financial problem.
"If that happens, give me a call."
It's unauthorized.
How old are your brothers and sisters?
Potatoes are very cheap.
Is anybody there?
Is Tom going somewhere?
Do you really think I'm going to help you?
Where did you go yesterday?
Why are we poor?
We'll be there by 2:30.
He can read.
I was having fun.
He was in time for the last bus.
Tom may be in Australia.
"He who surrenders hope, surrenders life."
I'll stay with Tom until you get back.
Tom thinks that Mary is afraid of snakes.
We're waiting for a tow truck.
This is too expensive.
Tom is Mary's brother-in-law.
These facts support my hypothesis.
Do you really think so?
Tom has Mary's support.
What's for dinner?
How many apple trees are there in your orchard?
He is in touch with all kinds of people.
I found my shoes.
Tom broke the awkward silence.
Tom wanted to play golf with Mary.
"In the winter, days are shorter."
Did Tom really come back?
Here we go again.
I want to join your team.
You were in a coma.
Did Tom tell you?
She must have studied very hard.
The evidence was against me.
It would be better if you didn't climb such a high mountain in the winter.
Talk to my boss.
Tom was singing.
We'll take a two-week holiday.
He shaves with an electric razor every morning.
I started crying.
Tom says he isn't planning to do that tomorrow.
I'm having problems.
That was enough for me.
I didn't know that someone was following me.
It may be expensive.
Tom is too smart for that.
Tom has beautiful blue eyes.
I don't understand girls at all.
I jumped back.
I haven't put on so much weight.
Tom isn't in New York now.
Take off your trousers.
Tom doesn't know which color to choose.
Tom should've asked.
That is not how we do things here.
Tom is acting as if nothing has happened.
I arrived at 2:30.
I'm Tom's niece.
"I told you not to call me Tom, didn't I?"
What station is it?
No one is unbeatable.
Don't you know the rules?
My bag is empty.
Do you still have it?
I've changed the plan.
He carries a bag on his back.
I've never seen Tom cry.
Do you think Tom will be late?
I'm not going anyplace.
I'm very unhappy.
These cameras are made in Japan.
Ask me anything anytime.
Is it really such a big deal?
Tom deleted all the files off his thumb drive.
I thought you were a Canadian.
The tourist bus crossed the border.
I think Tom may be right this time.
Why are you laughing?
Which one is more expensive?
Tom is a pushover.
What did you ask Tom for?
We have a signed divorce agreement.
He is a university student.
I'll try to convince Tom not to go.
I told Tom not to tell you.
We teach each other lots of things.
Is it as bad as that?
Tom may be back before 2:30.
I have another question.
Are you married to Tom?
Many people think I'm crazy.
It's a family secret.
I can't wait to tell you about what we did.
Do men cry?
Do you like rice?
"Wait a minute, Tom!"
Those houses are 500 years old.
War is a terrible thing.
They accused him of being part of the plot.
I wonder why Tom was so afraid.
I didn't want you to miss your bus.
You don't seem too worried.
It isn't always easy to read between the lines.
You have only one choice.
Ninja Turtles is my favorite game.
I don't have to say anything.
I think this is the only way to get rid of cockroaches.
"Tom was able to do that, too."
Can I get your autograph?
I forgot to give you my phone number.
This is very salty.
I really must be going.
Tom is haunted by his past.
Tom doesn't want anything bad to happen.
Tom smiled when he saw Mary.
Tom wanted you out of here.
Ask Tom to come to Boston.
I have never thought of that.
I won the event.
Do you have a gun?
My mother is making sandwiches for lunch.
Who did that yesterday?
You seem to know a lot about me.
I could help you.
The girl who works at the bakery is pretty.
Tom can't always get what he wants.
Tom had one younger brother.
Tom hasn't yet been warned.
What's eating her?
I would like to visit you.
Stay and watch.
I'd like to speak with Tom.
"By the way, do you play the violin?"
Step back.
"If you want to hear a scary story, I'll tell you about a dream I had a few weeks ago."
This is silly.
I think what you did was a mistake.
What on earth is going on here?
What season do you like the best?
The examinations will begin on Monday next week.
"I didn't do that, because I was sick."
I have to set an example.
What did you do that afternoon?
Sometimes I wonder whether or not there's a point to all of this.
You won't be arrested.
Everyone knew that except me.
A teacher should never laugh at his students' mistakes.
Give this to Tom.
I had to take care of her baby.
I shouldn't have done that. I'm sorry.
Can you remember the first word you learned in English?
I want Tom to help Mary do that.
A new idea came to me.
Something tells me that you're hiding something.
I have to go with Tom.
"You're my best friend, too."
Somebody help me.
Will you do that?
Language is a means of communication.
When did you find out that Tom didn't have a passport?
I didn't know you had so many cats.
Here is my phone number.
I was forced to lie.
Tom has to buy a book. That's why he's going to the bookstore.
Tom is small.
"I have a test today, too."
It's a pity that you couldn't come.
I have three dogs.
Sometimes I hear voices.
He hurt himself during yesterday's game.
You have to take that into account.
Something's wrong with Tom's car.
She has a great interest in music.
I saw you on television.
Did you call him up yesterday?
Her room is very small.
Tom never told me that you were so beautiful.
I have more money than you.
This is the best seafood restaurant in the neighborhood.
Open the safe.
There's someone waiting for you in the lobby.
Tom isn't in any hurry to retire.
I don't think it ever works.
The book is here.
"Water, forests, and minerals are important natural resources."
You have to tell Tom what's going on.
Tom and I have written several books together.
That's too personal.
Tom hasn't yet returned home.
This movie is long.
Can't we tell Tom?
I'm not good at public speaking.
I didn't win the prize.
Tom has admitted his guilt.
Tom wants to know your opinion.
Tom pushed the gate open.
Do you want to drive the tractor?
What would your mother say?
I didn't understand what Tom meant.
I've decided to fire you.
You still haven't told me why you decided not to go.
Start here.
That's not really necessary.
I didn't know I needed to do that.
I think I'll cry.
This is Tom's third trip to Australia.
I didn't mean to disturb you.
Let me concentrate.
Are you relaxed?
I've waited a long time for this.
Feel free to do whatever you like.
"Africa is a continent, but Greenland is not."
I want to know how you know that.
He read the letter again and again.
We were supposed to go together.
You said you were going to go to Boston this weekend.
I'm sure we'll find something to do.
Did anyone else notice this?
I think you're probably right.
Tomorrow there's a high probability it will rain.
Close the window before going to bed.
Tom grew up in a fishing village.
"She studies French, but I study Flemish."
Tom is anorexic.
I know that Tom did that.
It's obvious Tom and Mary like each other.
Tom is acting nuts.
I can't remember what I ate last night.
This isn't enough food to feed everyone.
What shall we eat for breakfast?
I crossed the equator for the first time on my trip to Australia.
Tom isn't there.
Welcome to the team.
Drink something.
I hope that you found everything.
I could've done that by myself.
Tom has heard it all before.
May I touch this?
Can you advise me?
Did you smile?
What time should I call you?
What happened between you and Tom?
You've slept a long time.
I'm the oldest one here.
Did you warn Tom?
Make your airplane reservations early since flights fill up quickly around Christmas.
I will advise you on the matter.
Don't forget to bring a camera.
Tom is going to marry Mary.
When do you have to leave?
I can't untie this knot.
Someone's humming.
He came back after two hours.
Can you come tomorrow morning?
I can see it in your eyes.
I just don't want to have people thinking I'm weak.
When does Tom's bus arrive?
I hardly slept last night.
He has brown eyes.
The animals are treated well.
What are Tom and Mary talking about?
Brazil was visited by the Pope.
Tom seems a lot happier since he got divorced.
I took a sip of wine.
We could go skating if you like.
Didn't you know Tom was planning to go to Australia with Mary?
Do you think so?
Exhale through your mouth.
It's just not right.
You can't stop progress.
Tom showed his photo album to Mary.
He was in France.
I can't believe I'm saying this out loud.
Tom declined to comment on the matter.
I'm surprised no one else heard the gunshots.
Tom believed that he could win.
You're so mean.
No one moved.
Tom is going to succeed.
Nobody deserves to die.
We heard a noise.
He is very young.
You should try it.
You owe me three dollars.
Tom seems to be lying.
Don't you remember me?
Have you been thinking about me?
The bath is ready.
He denies having broken the window.
He ate all of it.
I didn't want to speak to anyone.
"Of all the films I rented, this is the only one worth seeing."
Don't let them win.
I just barely managed to pass the test.
I do want to be remembered.
He's in the well.
Tom stepped out of the bathroom with a towel wrapped around his waist.
You're very lonely.
Tom knelt down.
You're too young to die.
They were dead.
Would you mind telling me how to do this?
I know that you'll never forgive Tom.
I gave you explicit instructions not to touch anything.
"That book costs 3,000 yen."
It's no wonder Tom's sleeping poorly; he drinks up to twelve cups of coffee a day.
Thank you for helping.
I started crying.
"At first, I didn't know what to do."
Everything Tom predicted came true.
I was impressed with Tom's work.
I swallowed the pill.
I know you believe me.
I called home.
I'm going to visit Tom in the hospital.
Do you want to come in?
What subjects do you study at school?
Where's the exit?
I didn't expect to see Tom there.
Let's all have supper.
Are you proud of your father?
How many people work for you?
We still have time.
Tom started to cry right away.
She'll lend you a book.
What do you think is going to happen?
I shouldn't have told Tom everything.
"We want to help, but we can't."
Tom was Mary's mentor.
"I heard that Mary was sick all last week, but she looks well now."
Cuff him.
He was drunk on beer.
I knew that you'd come.
I'm proud to be a part of this project.
It's a situation I would love to change.
Are you sure you just want water?
I just have a couple of questions.
Tom took the wrong train.
Is the hotel far from here?
Tom wasn't poor.
What's your favorite flower?
Don't you read the tabloids?
They gave it back.
All of us like her.
May I turn on the radio?
Why didn't you tell me about this?
Just tell Tom I called.
We're taking a big risk.
Tom isn't Mary's father.
Don't call anybody.
I think Tom has made a mistake.
Why are you so pessimistic?
Why did I ever listen to you?
I hear Latin music is taking the music industry by storm this year.
Tom spoke with Mary in French.
I have to sell my house.
I didn't want Tom to help me with my homework.
Without air we would die.
Does she like chocolate?
Some people are good talkers and others good listeners.
"I don't like cookies, either."
Why didn't you wait for us?
"You said you hated that, didn't you?"
Tom can't bear to think about it.
Come on. You can do that.
I won!
He wanted to meet me.
We need three cups.
What a beautiful place!
I've seen all that.
This was easy.
I want to talk to Tom's French teacher.
Do you cry often?
Are you busy tomorrow afternoon?
Are you sure you don't want me to tell Tom?
Tom removed his wet socks.
Tom is the oldest.
Time passed very quickly.
I'm not going to play guessing games with you.
Do you want me to wait?
There aren't enough chairs in the conference room.
Tom and Mary were playing on the seesaw.
I'm going to study French.
People have the right to defend themselves.
Who wants another piece of cake?
He was declared guilty.
Life is so strange.
Tom refused to believe Mary was guilty.
The water was too hot yesterday.
Tell me who'll do that.
I haven't seen it.
Tom is working at a restaurant.
Don't be a snob.
Both Tom and Mary are French teachers.
I love talking to Tom.
Please allow me to go.
Tom ran to the door.
School was closed for the day due to the snow.
Here's the map that you were looking for.
That's mine. Give it back.
She has a large office in this building.
You shouldn't go there by yourself.
I wouldn't lie to you.
I'm clean.
I'm ready!
I got your message.
Can you count to ten?
I'm waiting for a phone call.
They told me that Tom was dead.
It rarely snows here.
I came to thank you.
Were you here alone?
I told Tom I'd talk to Mary.
He began to be a problem.
Please don't leave.
I've done a lot already.
I'll never be your friend.
"That was Tom's idea, not mine. Don't blame me."
Tom runs faster than me.
I knew that Tom wasn't busy.
People blamed Tom.
No one's going to save you now.
Which one do you like better?
I don't have time to help you right now.
Is that all you have?
We didn't want to go to Boston.
Can a bee sting kill you?
This is the pen that he signed the document with.
I'd like to speak to you.
Tom gave me this for my birthday.
I'm going to fix it myself.
I've done many things I shouldn't have.
How exactly did you do that?
That's so terrible.
Our work here is almost done.
I'm glad you're having a good time.
Tom already understood everything.
They became man and wife.
We want to thank you for coming.
I never saw you.
That story of his sounds very unlikely.
Tom will do that if he has time.
Why did Tom tell Mary to do that?
Tom wanted answers.
Tom couldn't find his hometown on the map.
I always add a spoonful of honey to my tea.
Tom had a normal childhood.
Tom knows where I hid the money.
You can join us if you want.
I need to charge my cell phone.
That's why Tom is winning.
I want you to know I'll always love you.
My weight hasn't changed in the last three years.
I knelt down to tie my shoes.
It's 50 yen.
Did you just get up?
Tom got a three hundred dollar raise.
Tom is making a salad.
Do you have any smaller ones?
Someone had to do that.
You should cancel your trip.
I wish I hadn't told Tom that we did that.
It's fun to speak in French.
You can stay with me.
Germany made an alliance with Italy.
Can we do that later?
I liked them all.
Tom has locked himself in his bedroom.
Why don't you like working here?
Tom is coming back home tonight.
I bought this racket at a 20 percent discount.
I need to find Tom.
Tom is convinced that he's a relative of mine.
I'm not a magician.
Don't take that tone of voice with me.
Tom died a couple of years ago.
He left Japan never to come back.
No less than 100 people attended the meeting.
Do you want me to help you find Tom?
Do I have to do this now?
Go wake Tom up and tell him breakfast is ready.
I think that it's possible that there's nothing we can do.
I've told Tom everything I've told you.
You always destroy everything.
I knew you wouldn't like Tom.
I will do anything for him.
It may rain soon.
"Well, what did you find out?"
I saw the boat sink.
The ambassador was recalled.
Tom began working as a volunteer at the homeless shelter while he was still in high school.
Have you been told when to come?
Tom is a member of my crew.
Don't you understand what you have to do?
There are a few mistakes in this composition.
How did you get here so fast?
Do you see this?
"Having nothing to do, I watched television."
Don't call me when I'm at the office.
I suspected this would happen.
Tom slipped into the room.
Double the dose.
She saw him eating a sandwich.
Tom won't believe it.
Do you believe me now?
What I don't understand is why the children aren't being allowed to play outside on such a nice day.
Tom doesn't want to have lunch with me today.
Do you want me to get rid of this?
I can't make you any promises.
Don't forget to tell Mary that she has to get home before 2:30.
We need one more chair.
I made you coffee.
Do you have a bicycle?
They fought a fierce battle.
You're shivering.
I bet you'll be a great father.
Tom may not even be in Australia now.
He ought to have come by now.
"In your position, I'd probably have done the same thing."
It would be illogical.
The examination he took last week was very hard.
It takes two to tango.
I'll always need you.
I'm the one who saved you.
How I've missed you!
Tom isn't boring.
Who doesn't love Tom?
I said I was tired.
Tom moved to a different neighborhood.
"This is a nice place, don't you think?"
I don't have a cat.
I don't see the problem.
"He used to eat out every day, but now he can't afford it."
Let me call you back.
I don't agree with this.
A bad workman always blames his tools.
I see a man between the trees.
I'd have stayed if I could've.
Tom is much older than his wife.
The dog came running to her.
"Tom mentioned your name, too."
I'll make you happy.
Let's have a drink and listen to some music.
Hi.
I know that you still love me.
Have you ever had these symptoms before?
This doesn't fit.
We're still working.
Stop pretending that everything's okay. It's not.
None of us knew the answer.
She isn't good enough for him.
I'm now busy writing a book.
I got her to clean my room.
Try doing that again.
Tom said that he wanted something hot to drink.
I don't want to read anything.
Is there anyone who can speak French here?
The plane crash took 200 lives.
I made friends with many Americans at the party.
Brush your teeth after every meal.
Tell me what happened to Tom.
You put too much sugar in the tea.
"OK, I'm ready."
I've always known that.
I will do it on the condition that you help me.
We won.
Do you have kids?
Tom's pupils are dilated.
Tom was just about to leave.
I don't want to eat anything right now.
Nobody in the world wants war.
Tom has a flexible schedule.
My friend's father is a doctor.
I thought you were just kidding.
Taking off is easier than landing.
I still think we're safe.
You saved our lives.
Are you an extrovert or an introvert?
Tom is right behind us.
What kind of food should I be feeding my dog?
Does Tom know you're coming?
Do you know if Tom is here?
"Did you buy the ticket? ""Yes, I did."""
Tom would never walk again.
Tom turned on the faucet.
This is what I do for a living.
It was like torture.
Tom cut down the tree.
Tom wants to wait until Mary gets here.
Do I need to sign anything?
We don't need to hurry.
You opened the wrong box.
I was hoping for more than this.
Tom set the price at three hundred dollars.
It wasn't true.
I can speak French and also English.
They were there.
Tom is guilty.
Please speak more quickly.
Pass me the wine.
I don't give lessons.
What goes around comes around.
They did not keep their word.
Tom contradicts himself all the time.
I need a change.
I want to travel around the world.
Let's meet at the same place that we met last time.
He is busy with the final draft.
I can read you like a book.
Tell them to stop.
Would you mind translating this for me?
This is the village where I was born.
Would you help me?
Tom can't find the right words to describe his feelings for Mary.
Tom is a yodeler.
Be home before dark.
I'm in love with somebody else.
Did anybody leave me a message?
Did you know there was a secret passage hidden behind the bookcase?
Don't believe any of it.
He doesn't love me anymore.
Tom seems to be prepared.
He was sick in bed all day yesterday.
Mary is Tom's grandmother.
He's helping me.
He returned home three hours later.
Tom said he liked snow.
We arrived at the office on time.
Are those your daughters?
That's why I'm here.
Tom bores me.
You're charismatic.
Is there anything to drink in the fridge?
It's clear they thought I was somebody else.
I know you had to do that.
Perhaps we should contact Tom.
I like cooking and reading.
Tom went back home.
I'd rather die.
Tom doesn't know which way to go.
What'll change?
I'm now very tired.
We haven't found it.
That was a waste of money.
It's your life.
Everyone's sick.
That would be cool.
Mary knows everything about the latest fashion trends.
Why are you so thin?
Take this medicine and you'll feel better soon.
Tom claims he was abducted by aliens.
Doing that was quite simple.
Tom said that he wanted some money.
It's impossible to fix.
I never forgot you.
"Show me the way, please."
Tom claims that he can read people's minds.
Do I look insane?
The results were shocking.
You could've sent Tom some money.
I'll be right back with your drinks.
I have a small gift for Tom.
It was discreet of you to keep it a secret from him.
Tom gave a banana to Mary.
Are you making a pass at me?
I think we need a whole new approach.
We're working for world peace.
Am I still under arrest?
What long hair you've got!
"Take it, or leave it."
Poinsettias are poisonous to cats and dogs.
I'm not going to do it anymore.
I think this is the best part.
You're all cowards.
It'll burn.
I think the train will come soon.
Would you like me to stop?
They all have one thing in common.
You were very brave.
I think we shouldn't leave early.
You must not speak ill of others behind their backs.
I didn't know which one to buy.
What makes you think Tom did that?
Who should I inform?
Will you go on a picnic with me?
I realized I couldn't win.
Tell me why you did it.
I'm not as rich as I'd like to be.
My resume isn't as impressive as yours.
Tom asked me for Mary's number.
We asked Tom about Mary.
This is your problem.
The French and Indian War had begun.
Tell Tom that I'm pruning the trees.
Give me thirty seconds.
Did your cat die?
It's my brother's.
Didn't you know Tom lived with his aunt and uncle?
The climate is moist and warm.
Tom is manipulating you.
I didn't say you could go.
They won the kissing contest.
The toilet doesn't flush properly.
The brakes don't work.
Your behavior leaves much to be desired.
I don't mind if you smoke.
How much salt should I add?
He was not the kind of man that people liked.
Go straight home.
Both Tom and Mary laughed.
Stay awake.
Do you know how deep the water is?
I haven't opened the box yet.
I'm on a strict diet.
I'm tied up now.
I'll try again.
How did you know where to find me?
You really should eat before you leave.
What does this have to do with me?
"Don't just stand there, say something."
It would have been better if you had waited yesterday.
"Why are you wet? ""I fell in the water."""
She put on her coat and went out.
Tom said you'd ask a lot of questions.
Tom was too old.
"If that happens, let me know."
I hope someday I'll be able to do that.
I didn't hear any voices.
Tom didn't want to learn how to do that.
I have to know what's at stake.
How many fingers am I holding up?
Can you justify your claim?
I still haven't found Tom.
Don't tell anyone yet.
Tom is having a very hard time trying to figure out how to do that.
"I'm proud of you, Tom."
How much jam did you buy?
Try not to splatter the ink.
Nobody waits for me.
Tom can't come to the office today.
Are you really afraid to be in the same room with Tom?
Tom likes to fish.
"You owe me $1,000."
Have you been busy recently?
She is getting prettier.
I can't thank you enough.
I'll be there tomorrow.
I usually eat eggs for breakfast.
"When you go to Boston, could I go with you?"
Tom sweated.
School is a waste of time.
Does that make you happy?
Aren't you ready?
You're looking well.
Tom told us what was going on.
Tom wanted to help me.
We know what's going to happen.
That's so bizarre.
Aren't you glad to meet me?
I know you're afraid.
He comes here twice a week.
I didn't make those answers up.
I don't think that Tom did that intentionally.
I've got some new information.
Tom didn't know what Mary wanted him to do.
Did you make dinner?
I'm certain that that won't happen today.
Some things in life are beyond our ability to control.
My dog likes you.
Nothing scares me.
Tom didn't have any socks on.
You're so rude.
Everybody is doing that.
That's wonderful!
Your room is a mess.
Tom visits us twice a year.
He loves no one but her.
"Silence can be misinterpreted, but never misquoted."
I told Tom about what had happened.
I wasn't ready.
Tom said that he didn't have time to eat.
They're still looking.
Did you see that?
No one knows what Tom looks like.
Write your name in full.
I didn't manage to see who it was.
I'm not at all worried.
I want to talk to your brother.
Can I turn on the TV?
Tom is smarter than I am.
The same goes for Tom.
The ship crashed on the rocks.
"This is mine, isn't it?"
Some people don't like that.
I'll get better.
I wonder why we play tennis in miniskirts.
I know a few French songs.
I hope Tom will teach me French.
Tom isn't Mary's type.
My grandmother always said it was a sin to waste food.
His room is always tidy.
You can depend on Tom.
Tom knew what I felt.
I don't know any of those boys.
So what were we talking about?
I had a great time in Boston.
Where did Tom live when he was a kid?
Tom thought no one knew what he was doing.
You know this isn't fair.
Have you ever killed someone?
The girl went to school in spite of her illness.
Tom doesn't care who wins.
The young man burst into laughter.
I never lost hope.
Who is currently the richest person in the world?
He is always on the move.
I do hope everything will go smoothly.
I admire their ingenuity.
"She's beautiful, too."
I've gained three kilos.
Tom told me he'd help us.
"When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, Jesus went up to Jerusalem."
The only person who could've done this is Tom.
We'll talk about it.
Is it OK if we do this later?
We've been waiting a long time.
Tom says Mary is still alive.
One day you'll thank me.
Do you live in this building?
Tom went bonkers.
I'm not sure I have enough time to clean my room before I go to school.
I'm sure my wallet was on top of the dresser.
Why did Tom refuse to help you?
You should get married again.
"When the time's right, you'll know."
No one thinks that you're a coward.
We're out of danger.
You're a filthy liar!
Who's coming with me?
Tom refused the food he was offered.
The paintings that were stolen from Tom are very valuable.
I don't think I've ever seen anything so beautiful.
I'm not a crook.
Tom hasn't been outside all week.
Let's hope that's the last time that that happens.
Do you know how to use it?
I told you this would happen.
"You prepared for this, didn't you?"
Tom wanted me to help him today.
Where were you?
Do you know how to use it?
I didn't know we weren't supposed to do that.
I know that Tom is a bartender.
I'll deal with Tom myself.
This building used to be a hospital.
She is able to answer your question.
I know I don't deserve you.
He banged his head.
"Tom is boring, isn't he?"
Tom has offered to drive us home.
I know you're afraid of heights.
Waiting is boring.
Nobody here seems to know where Tom is.
I don't think that Tom knows what he's talking about.
This video game is very realistic.
Tom gets good grades in French.
There were a lot of people in the room.
Mary isn't your girlfriend. She's mine.
I don't know if he's a doctor.
Tom wanted to give Mary a birthday present.
He lost his father at sea.
Tom was stabbed in the chest.
Take your time with it.
I don't have to tell Tom anything.
Only Tom can leave.
Nobody has solved the problem.
Tom felt the same way.
Tom's name was on the list.
Tom didn't want to see me.
Did you really think that I wouldn't notice?
"Excuse me, do you know what time it is?"
Tom won the hot dog eating contest.
I don't like big cities.
I'm not going to call you.
Tom has been asking for money.
We couldn't see a thing.
We all knew that it would happen sooner or later.
Tom has asked why we haven't finished yet.
Look at all those birds.
I know her slightly.
Tom and Mary want to talk to me.
Vigorous exercise makes you sweat.
I want you to take me back home.
"Even though he was sick, he went to school."
Anyone would've done the same thing.
She's as naked as a jaybird.
I didn't know that Tom was Mary's uncle.
Tom and Mary have done that before.
I didn't catch even one fish.
You're hiding something from me.
I love chocolate.
What's all that for?
We found the perfect place.
"Wow, that's great."
Tell them to hurry up.
Tom and Mary were sitting on the sofa as far away from each other as possible.
I heard the bell.
Tom is chatting with Mary.
Look at the clock.
Tom will lend you money if you ask him to.
I don't want Tom there.
I woke up at five this morning.
It's strange that our friends are not here.
It was raining heavily in Osaka.
The test results are still not in.
"Due to my lumbago, I won't be able to attend Koizumi's party."
Tom hasn't said a word to me all day.
Who are you afraid of?
Dinner is on the table.
I think you'll find it very interesting.
Your situation isn't hopeless.
What do you think about all this?
"This dress cost me over 40,000 yen."
Isn't this wonderful?
Tom said he wasn't angry anymore.
Give me back my glasses.
Tom never makes his bed.
All you had to do was talk to Tom.
I'd rather stay home and knit.
Try to understand me.
I saw the boat sink.
The dog is mine.
My sister hit the jackpot!
Tom doesn't know who shot him.
Yesterday I met Tom on the way to school.
I didn't hear Tom.
Why don't you buy a motorcycle?
Tom is no longer alive.
That wasn't very good.
He has an ear for music.
Tom was waiting for you.
I love that idea.
My brother is two years older than I am.
I went to visit my grandfather's grave today.
Would you mind if I took the pink one?
Let's get coffee.
He is working hard in order to pass the entrance examination.
Do you want to go or not?
Women generally outlive their husbands.
"If you want to go, then go."
I don't want to play golf.
Tom is tone deaf.
Who can blame you?
Tom and Mary continued to look at each other.
They could hardly see.
The movie was long and boring.
Tom's home and office were searched by the police.
I'm glad Tom enjoyed it.
We're not going to hurt you.
How was your biology exam?
I don't know Tom's phone number.
The door has been forced.
Tom is too young to do that.
That was unexpected.
Do you have a calculator that I could borrow?
Talk to Tom again.
Nobody knew that Tom wasn't a Canadian.
I was about to call you.
Tom thanked Mary for her gift.
They're not sure.
Tom's feelings were not reciprocated.
He wrote a prompt answer to my letter.
This is plagiarism.
He did not like her manner of speech.
I hear everything you're saying.
I thought it was just a metaphor.
I outrank you.
My dog sometimes eats grass.
I wish you a happy birthday.
Tom is never going to do that again.
I need to know what Tom knows.
Didn't I tell you to close the door?
I thought that you looked sad.
It's my horse.
Yellow is my favorite color.
I didn't move anything.
We learned a lot of things.
This has become a part of my daily life.
You must be careful in choosing your friends.
It wasn't easy to do that.
I'm not feeling very well myself.
Let Tom know.
I'm working on the problem.
A woman's place is in the home.
Tom circled the word with his pencil.
Mary is wearing a blue dress.
They saw a strange animal there.
I'm not planning to meet Tom at the airport.
You've got to be kidding!
We traveled around the country by car.
Tom refused to eat.
They've found survivors.
I'll shoot you.
Tom said he enjoyed the concert.
They treat me like a child.
It's OK with me if it's OK with you.
I'm so glad you've come.
Tom didn't know someone wanted to kill him.
Tom reacted very quickly.
You've got to win today.
That's uncalled for.
He thought that he was a genius.
Who went with you?
It's dirt cheap.
The thought flashed through her mind that she was going to die.
I like Tom's plan better than Mary's plan.
You can go to sleep now.
Many a student has failed the test.
Do you have a receipt?
I don't want anything more.
I want you to wash the car.
Tom and I are brothers.
Tom said that you were crazy.
"You don't know how to do it, do you?"
What is the teacher's last name?
Can we do that?
Let's begin with Lesson 3.
Do you think Tom made a good decision?
I fell from a tree.
He did all he could to win her favor.
Tom is an ordinary teenager.
I've told you about it before.
Tom says he doesn't remember what happened that night.
He has a black shirt.
Water is urgently needed.
I was in Australia last year.
Do both of you do that?
Tom and Mary both turned around to watch.
The teacher pointed her finger at me and asked me to go with her.
How will you stop me?
They can vouch for Tom.
Is this true?
I told Tom I didn't know Mary.
Tom is the best player on our team.
Tom was three when his father died.
"You know Tom, don't you?"
We need to find out who drove that car.
Snow reminds me of my hometown.
Tom is too young to join the army.
I'd like to try this on.
What do you like to do?
I always try to be polite.
Tom didn't convince me.
Tom made light of a difficult situation.
We weren't ready for it.
You're lucky nobody saw you do that.
Please call me a doctor.
Try the cake.

"Before the arrival of the Europeans, yellow fever hadn't been a problem."
What happened to it?
This molecule has a crystalline structure.
Tom was afraid he might get fired.
Do you have a friend named Tom?
I like talking to you.
It was good news.
Everybody here knows that you don't eat pork.
Don't change a thing.
Tom just smiled and left the room.
Here's my email address.
I tricked you.
I saw a cat running after the dog.
I am at home every evening.
"Tom's a decent, law-abiding citizen."
I think we should try doing that.
Tom is headstrong.
Ivory Coast is the world's biggest cocoa producer.
Tom burned his hand on the stove.
That's not the goal.
I'm late for dinner.
At what time does it close?
I haven't yet told Tom what to do.
Will you help me with Tom?
Do you know what time the class will start?
I didn't think that it would be that easy to do that.
I want to grow old with you.
He has the habit of scratching his head.
Why would Tom help us?
"We'll talk soon, Tom."
"I don't know why, exactly."
Aren't you glad I got a job?
"If you don't leave now, you'll be late."
Someone stole my backpack.
I suspect Tom is ready to do that.
Can I just ask a few questions?
Is Tom really sick?
You had better not go there.
I know who we can get to help us.
Aren't you glad?
I tried to hide my disappointment.
I'm not afraid of snakes anymore.
I'll give you as many as you like.
Tom told me he doesn't want to work with you.
I've taken care of that.
Tom is an excellent father.
Who else was at the party?
I was going to tell you everything.
Good afternoon.
Tom didn't like Mary's parents.
I can't go to the police.
She cannot have broken her promise.
"Finally, he achieved his goal."
"Tom got tired of waiting for Mary, so he left without her."
Tom needed attention.
Tom has been asked to give a speech.
Is it morning already?
I had a little fever this morning.
I am already late.
How do you know I don't have it?
"Tom was badly in debt for a while, but he's on his feet again."
Tom noticed that I was there.
Tom said that there was something we had to talk about.
It snowed from Monday to Friday.
Tom had trouble resolving the situation.
I was happy to help you.
I won't tell you and Tom.
What was Tom doing the last time you saw him?
Some photos were printed in black and white.
I knew you wouldn't have enough money.
Bring in some firewood.
Why didn't Tom tell me?
Tom suddenly started to cry.
We'll talk to Tom on October 20th.
I've given you everything you've asked for.
Did Tom go fishing by himself?
She is holding a ladle with her left hand.
Tom is taking off his coat.
I'll never forgive Tom for doing that.
It won't take much time.
Seize the moment.
Tom started yelling at Mary.
It's just not worth it.
I don't like the dress you're wearing.
I knew Tom wouldn't do that.
I wish I didn't have to tell you this.
Let's forget about what just happened.
Quit acting like a baby.
I need you to do it yourself.
You aren't listening.
Push the red button.
Someone screamed.
I wouldn't mind some company.
Theoretically it should work.
I know you've got a secret.
I want everyone to show me his or her driver's license.
I know it's highly unlikely that I'll be able to convince you that you're wrong.
I've just come back from a long trip.
Both of the rooms are open.

I must start packing.
Our success depends upon whether you will help us or not.
We'll start at nine tomorrow.
I'm creative.
You'll be happy.
"Hey, come here."
I just need to know what happened.
What does this have to do with what I was saying about Tom?
Her gray hair makes her look older than her age.
I feel weak.

Water is 800 times heavier than air.
How do you know which one is yours?

The container is full.

A canary is a small bird and people sometimes keep it as a pet.
To what do I owe this unexpected pleasure?
Go get some help.
I wasn't the one who told Tom that.
"You aren't very busy, are you?"
We tried to warn them.
Will you lend me your bicycle?
I don't think that Tom expected me to win.
Who's that for?
Add my name to the list.
See you soon.
I want Tom to wait.
There's something Tom isn't telling Mary.
Don't get me involved.
We're cold.

You shouldn't be angry.
How do you know Tom won't win?

I was planning on telling you tomorrow.
I'm thirty years older than you.
Would you like to come with us?
I don't want to give you my money.

All you have to do to pass the entrance examination is to read this book.
Don't think it has nothing to do with you.
Tom is looking forward to taking some time off.
You know that you need it.
Tom asked Mary if she was planning to buy a new car.
Tom is the enemy.
Tom was madly in love with Mary.
What color is Mary's scarf?
Who does Tom know?
Why doesn't Tom leave?
Is that your goal?
Tom made that himself.
Welcome to our house.
The train is here.
I eat a lot of rice.
I have two sons. One is in Boston and the other in Chicago.
The fog is getting thick.
I'm trying to get someone to help me.
He was sitting there.
We should do more.
"Tom was going to be transferred to Boston, but they decided to fire him instead."
I said I would help you.
I don't know how to use it.
I can see myself in my children.
"I'm looking for Tom. You don't know where he is, do you?"
"If you have a problem, talk to Tom."
Tom told me not to go there by myself.
Why didn't we notice it before?
Is this my fault?
Believe none of what you hear and only half of what you see.
We aren't ready yet.
They're police officers.
Tom has immunity.
We need a fresh supply of tennis balls.
Why are you so pale today?
How long have you known about it?
Tom eats a healthy breakfast every morning.
I want you to listen to me.
"You told me not to talk to Tom, remember?"
Don't quote me on that.
Tom has quite a temper.
I'm full of hope.
I never thought about it that way.
I did that right away.
Tom thought Mary was awake.
I took a shortcut.
Do you think I want to do this?
I often look up words in that dictionary.
He isn't able to drive a car.
"I told you not to call me Tom, didn't I?"
You need to go away.
I started packing.
I don't care who you are.
Tom can explain.
Tom explained the purpose of the project to Mary.
Are you heading somewhere?
Tom needed some help.
I love all of you.
I see what you meant.
I had an interesting conversation with my neighbor.
Go up those stairs.
You are a teacher.
I am going to call on her tomorrow.
Do you need to buy anything?
I can understand how you feel.
I couldn't stop crying.
The number of fish in the ocean is steadily declining.
I almost didn't come.
I don't want to hear about all your old girlfriends.
Tom's parents locked him in the cellar.
Are you at liberty to talk?
You know it.
This is useful information.
I'd like you to leave my house.
Maybe you should ask.
Please bring a salad.
"Dad told me to help you, Mom."
"Sorry, I can't help."
That mountain is about three thousand meters high.
"Hold the elevator, Tom."
We meet once a month.
Who was wrong?
Tom needs to go with Mary.
He is happy.
Tom seemed to be lonely.
I want to eat steak.
Tom knows what to do now.
Tom's turn came.
My father drives a very old car.
The doctor told him to give up smoking and drinking.
I opened the lid.
Where's your hat?
I was a fool to trust you.
Perhaps we'll find it.
I hate flies.
That will be discussed later.
I'm efficient.
I don't think that Tom knows who painted that picture.
I was bored with the monotony of daily life.
Did Tom tell Mary when to come?
I'm good at singing.
I'm still working in Australia.
Tom's mother was a wise woman.
Who drank my beer?
Tom is eager to do that.
Tom is a gifted artist.
None of the rooms is ready.
You'd better eat everything that's on your plate.
Tom's in love with Mary's best friend.
Nobody told me Tom would be here.
Guess where I've been.
The pond has frozen over.
This ticket is valid for two days after purchase.
Why are you looking for a job?
He's not allowed to leave the country.
The window is open.
Stop speaking in riddles.
You don't give orders here.
Dust off the shelf.
I wonder who.
I wish I hadn't lent so much money to Tom.
We didn't agree.
We see each other every day.
I've never needed anybody.
Your parents will never allow you to go.
She agreed with him.
Tom will probably not win anymore.
Tom walked home with Mary.
Tom is originally from Australia.
Tom uses an electric toothbrush.
Do you know who that person is?
I had never seen her before that time.
Was that Tom?
That's all I was waiting for.
I bought Tom a watch.
But I wasn't afraid.
What do you think I'm trying to do?
Tell me his name.
Tom is almost never late.
I didn't get hurt.
"After some hesitation, he laid the book on the desk."
I don't think that he'll come.
We should be with Tom.
He drives an electric car.
I've been trying to imagine my life without you.
Which cup will he choose?
I play football.
No one moved.
Do you know who bought your painting?
We must not lose hope.
She likes the teacher.
Stop playing around.
Is this a wine?
I read a most interesting novel yesterday.
I need you to tell me the truth.
That's a crime.
She didn't try to hide the truth.
She'll come even if you tell her not to.
Tom has been doing that for less than three years.
I've heard that Tom is sick.
Did you have something you wanted to say?
You're lying to me.
Tom might be able to help you tomorrow.
May I take off my coat?
I think you didn't do it.
Is Tom still singing?
Would you please take off your shoes?
I'm in love with her.
"Well, Tom, you were right."
Tom's ugly.
I barely managed to catch the train.
I'll see you upstairs.
Open up the door.
"If I were rich, I'd go abroad."
I need a keyboard.
I should've kept that secret.
Tom owes me $300.
This medicine will take the pain away.
Tom was writing a letter to Mary this morning.
What a cute baby!
Don't smoke here.
Why did you stop only the foreigners?
Tom never said that he wanted to leave.
I also visited Boston.
"If I eat any more, I won't want dessert."
You need to see this.
Tom told me that he'd won.
Could you please help me? I've lost an important document.
I knew Tom wasn't married anymore.
I cut the paper with a pair of scissors.
I'm just looking out for Tom.
The bride suddenly laughed.
Have you seen this man?
Is your father in the garden?
I know Tom has already left Australia.
"If you go out so lightly dressed, you'll catch a cold."
Tom doesn't know how to tie his shoes.
It's the best French restaurant in New York.
Tom caught three fish yesterday.
Who do you suggest we talk to?
Is that why you're leaving?
I have to make certain Tom knows where he needs to go.
You're being hypocritical.
I want my 20 dollars back.
Please write down what I am going to say.
How were the pyramids built?
Do you have a moment?
Tom opened a bottle of wine.
I understood almost everything.
Can you name anyone that we know who is as talented as he is?
The management said that a wage increase was out of the question.
Do you like coffee?
They're not idiots.
It wasn't supposed to happen yet.
I did it with my eyes closed.
You know that that isn't possible.
I got better after taking that medicine.
I'll solve that problem.
I suspect what Tom said was a lie.
I'm impatient for spring to arrive.
I went to the scene of the crime.
Tom told Mary to keep that a secret.
Do you like Australia?
Tom can't read or write.
Tom told me he had a headache.
I am glad that you have helped me.
I do not agree.
We cut our living costs.
Tom's eyes were shut.
I went to Boston on Monday.
I'll help you any way I can.
It looks fascinating.
Come visit us again next year.
Tom decided to go home early.
I was feeling unwell.
Did Tom get away?
I want a new knife.
I can't love anyone but you.
"Tom is weak now, but his intellect is sound."
Maybe he was ill.
Can you read French?
That's a strange problem.
Tom will be back in an hour.
Do not throw anything out of the window.
His behavior is very odd today.
"You've read the report, haven't you?"
I know a lot about music.
I'm trying to save your life.
I didn't think you would win the race.
I love arguing with Tom.
I wasn't that bad.
Can we do this some other time?
I can't leave now.
You should get back home.
Are you messing with me?
How did your interview go?
Tom told me not to go into his bedroom.
Tom is taller than his father.
Why do you need them?
Do you like women?
Tom is the one who asked Mary to do that.
Don't hurt anybody.
I don't know Tom's brother.
I don't ride my bicycle very often.
I know who the thief is.
Bring it back when you're done.
I love you and I always will.
Why did you stay at home yesterday?
Tom wanted to say goodbye.
What does that tell us?
Could he be Tom's son?
Tom rubbed his chin.
It's time to rest.
Where is the evidence?
I'll allow you to go.
Didn't you know Tom was going to be here today?
I didn't say I wasn't going.
It's already eleven. It's high time you were in bed.
Tell me the meaning of life.
I'll be back in three hours.
Tom told me not to tell Mary about what happened.
You should try to learn a little French.
He doesn't look happy.
We knew Tom was there.
You can't count on his help.
I can accept that.
I never thought that I'd say this.
Did you phone me?
Tom pushed his glasses up.
I didn't want to do what Tom asked me to do.
"Even if I were rich, I wouldn't give him money."
Tom said that Mary saw John doing that.
I sincerely apologize.
I know that Tom is skeptical.
Your parents will never allow you to go.
"I'd like you to do it, too."
It'll be difficult to get Tom to change his mind.
My parents want me to study medicine.
The call is free of charge.
I owe him nothing.
Tom said he'd help Mary with her plan.
I can't decide whether to do that or not.
I knew all about it.
Do you know what Tom does?
Tom's car was stolen.
Tom sat on the ground.
"Hurry up, girls."
We're glad it all worked out.
I think I made a good impression.
Get serious.
"I thought I saw Tom in the park, but it was someone else."
Don't forget that.
Please tell us.
What's the matter? You look pale.
I did that and Tom did that as well.
Tom thought that Mary was in Boston.
Thanks for telling me the truth.
Can you still help us?
The leaves are turning yellow.
I'll call back at 2:30.
Everyone looked confused and terrified.
I've told Tom everything I've told you.
You know I can't sing.
How far is the next farm?
I met them last week.
The chair is too low for me.
Your pants are dirty.
I have no intention of doing that.
She was the last person I expected to see in such a place.
Tom told me to answer all your questions.
Tom and Mary are the same height.
Let me deal with Tom.
"If you want to sit down, sit down."
You're not late.
That is quite possible.
She took full responsibility for her actions.
Look! She's coming!
That's what Tom was looking for.
Look after the children this afternoon.
It's open.
I do what I'm told to do.
I don't think that Tom will like this game.
Do you want that?
When are you busy?
She handed him the key.
We had to smoke our meat to preserve it.
The city supplied the needy with blankets.
Have you seen anything unusual lately?
Tom won't bother Mary anymore.
When did you try doing that?
I don't want to think about those things.
Can you suggest anyone for the job?
We made him go.
Tom hates women.
This is where Tom stays when he's in Boston.
I have ten times more books than you do.
Can I bring my friend with me?
What business is that of yours?
Tom showed us his stamp collection.
We've consulted with experts.
The officer inspired his men to be brave.
Boys are more aggressive than girls.
Does Tom understand?
Tom's had a lot of girlfriends.
Why did you turn off the TV?
"Did she buy a watch? ""Yes, she did."""
I don't need your money.
Don't go home yet.
I don't use taxis unless it's absolutely necessary.
I'm not a bit angry.
Nobody does this kind of thing alone.
Tom pulled off his gloves.
Aren't you a banker?
Why didn't you run away?
We're not blaming you.
You're too polite.
You said I was a liar.
I don't recall asking for your advice.
I knew I might not have to do that anymore.
Tom deserves all of it.
Many children in Wisconsin play hockey in the winter.
Are you a seismologist?
No medicine can cure this disease.
Tom wears horn-rimmed glasses.
My father is a bus driver.
What were you doing in Boston?
Tom may be out.
I don't want to break your heart.
Please tell me about it tomorrow.
Stay here and help me.
Didn't you say Tom died?
Tom says he's willing to take the risk.
Tom helped Mary into the car.
Cookie licked Tom's face.
What else is in the closet?
Do you want to eat this?
I wouldn't blame you.
Can I do this?
Have you ever repaired a TV?
I was just scared.
I'm waiting for her to come here.
You're not the only Canadian here.
I didn't know Tom was good at swimming.
I want you to go with Tom.
Tom told me he didn't get enough sleep.
Which one of them is mine?
I want to see him at all costs.
Don't do anything like that again.
I remember it very well.
We've decided to try doing that again.
What are these things used for?
I believe Tom is innocent.
Everyone's lying.
We have to be realistic.
Tom is much younger than Mary.
It won't last more than three minutes.
Tom didn't know whether he was right or wrong.
I left everything there.
You look very beautiful.
I'm sure you're busy.
Tom is a very nice guy.
Please support Tom.
The lid screws onto the jar.
Did you bring your family with you?
My mother is in the hospital now.
Put that one back.
Tom has lost his new umbrella.
Raise your left hand.
It has a hole in it.
I went to the library.
My house isn't large.
There shouldn't be anyone here.
I'm happy with this.
You won't feel a thing.
There comes the bus.
Tell me about what happened in Boston.
I won't go to Australia this year.
I'm looking for a bag for my wife.
All I think about is you.
Wait a minute. I'll be right back.
Did Tom tell you not to do that?
I felt my phone vibrating in my pocket.
I wish I hadn't married you.
She's crazy.
I didn't even know that you had one.
I've come to ask you a favor.
We live close to the station.
That doesn't sound very polite.
That would be better.
He can play all the songs of the Beatles on the piano.
You're irreplaceable.
Tom bought a Japanese-Chinese dictionary.
Tom doesn't smile very often.
Flour is made from wheat.
I seldom do that in the morning.
Your English is perfect.
In Japan there are four seasons a year.
My foot's asleep again!
How long have you been together?
Are you sure you want this?
Stay with Tom.
Tom is drunk.
We must act at once.
I like strawberries very much.
I've got your passport.
Do you have friends in Boston?
Tom is going to go to Boston in October.
I don't want that much milk.
A great number of citizens went into the army.
I hate the sound of my voice.
That worries me.
Tom just tried to choke me.
"Great weather, isn't it?"
You won't need to do that today.
"Which do you drink more, coffee or tea?"
There's nothing left.
I don't know what could have happened to it.
Tom knows it was a mistake.
There's someone here who wants to see you.
He took me for an Englishman.
Can you remember what happened?
Tom has gotten married.
Tom told me that he had been sick.
I had nobody to play with when I lived with my grandmother.
Tom changed his appearance drastically.
A rolling stone gathers no moss.
I didn't know Tom worked there.
Maybe you're not as stupid as you look.
Your biggest enemy is yourself.
You're not dead yet.
The baby kept quiet.
That's pure genius.
Tom is on his lunch break.
Tom was found shot to death.
We should take off our shoes before entering the house.
A notice about the next meeting was posted on the door.
You'll be missed by your friends.
I haven't discussed this with anyone.
Tom is wearing dark brown shoes.
"You've changed your mind, haven't you?"
Tom didn't hesitate to tell Mary the truth.
I don't have any problems at all.
Tom started taking pictures.
Tom and Mary are going to be there tonight.
You're such a flirt.
You did not say so.
The mouse ran under the bed.
Birds fly long distances.
My grandma injured her leg in a fall.
Everything is relative.
We have to figure out what happened to Tom.
I wonder what we'll be doing this time next year.
I thought that you told me you could do that.
"Tom ran to his room, crying."
She had her hat blown off by the wind.
"That's your favorite, right?"
I think I'll be able to help you.
I just met a boy named Tom.
The police officer wore a bulletproof vest.
I think you need to see him.
I didn't see you come in.
Don't be late for work.
Do you love Tom?
She's but a child.
Do you still need them?
Tom has been taken hostage.
Doctors were afraid to remove the bullet.
How many guards were there?
He woke up in the middle of the night.
Tom is the guilty one.
I changed my name to Tom.
Tom lost his passport.
I went to the park to play.
Give Tom the money.
I've lost a little weight.
You should tell the boss.
Have you ever seen a grown man cry?
Do you have internet access at home?
Tom will wait for Mary.
Tom has agreed to help us paint our house.
I told Tom you'd wait.
You don't know whether he has a girlfriend?
Do you have a snow shovel?
Tom's conduct is a reflection on the way he was brought up.
A man can't be judged by his appearance.
I need to know where Tom buried the gold.
I'll send for you.
Please close the window.
We need your key.
I never saw him before.
Please bring a cup of tea to me.
Tom needs to talk to you.
Why didn't you answer me?
Tom sat down on a folding chair.
I hope this isn't a mistake.
Where do they want to go?
I feel very unhappy.
This book is suitable for beginners.
The story reminds me of an experience I had long ago.
We're wasting time.
Good shoes are expensive.
What did you do yesterday evening?
We sang around the campfire.
Tom will be here until noon.
I made some corrections.
Tom should just talk to Mary.
They all giggled.
Have you already forgotten me?
You've underestimated Tom.
Maybe you gave up too fast.
I had never been late for school before.
That's not what I meant.
We haven't really talked about this.
I'm a bit confused.
You're smarter than me.
We're giving up.
Maybe Tom can help you.
You know who I mean.
I just stubbed my toe.
That's fair.
Tom asked me for advice.
She watches TV constantly.
Is it a joke?
It doesn't seem so absurd.
That's not going to happen.
I wasn't home.
You should give up smoking.
This is our ship's maiden voyage.
I brought my kids up well.
Do you want to see something funny?
I wanted to go home.
How often do you go fishing?
Did you hear about what Tom did?
I'm still here in Australia.
We'll miss you.
Put your hat back on.
Could you speak a little louder?
I'd rather eat somewhere else.
What a beautiful town!
She caught him cheating on a test.
I'm sure that Tom didn't mean to hurt you.
Tom has never lived anywhere but Boston.
I didn't know you couldn't speak French.
Tom acted strange.
Tom is strict but fair.
He told me about it in private.
I am pleased to help you if I can.
I'm just going to drop by the post office.
The company's stock price jumped yesterday.
I'm fat.
This has nothing to do with that.
We do everything we're asked.
The table is wobbly.
Tom has a large bedroom.
Visit us tomorrow.
What should I tell the kids now?
"It's you that Mary loves, not me."
I don't care what he does.
You were always playing tricks on me when we were in junior high school.
Can't you do it any faster?
She doesn't know what she really wants.
Tom said that he wanted to buy a horse.
Let's talk about your work.
You haven't told me why you asked me to come here.
He knows what he's talking about.
Please throw this away.
We need to lower our expenses.
My husband is away for the weekend.
I don't think that it's a problem.
He claims that he is a painter.
Why wasn't that in the report?
Mary looked at herself in the mirror.
I don't think it's important.
I thought about you all day.
I hope you're listening.
She's sitting in the kitchen and drinking tea.
"Come on, do it."
Wash the dishes.
The castle was in disrepair.
Where's my brother?
Why did you leave the door open?
Don't be hypocritical.
Why do you need it?
Thanks for the tip.
I didn't know you were busy.
Do you know anybody who speaks five languages?
I'd like a little more water.
We ate some apples.
I'm looking at those flowers.
Would you mind waiting a moment?
You were absolutely right.
Are you pleased with the results?
How about going to a movie tonight?
I'm in seventh heaven.
Tom didn't buy any bread.
I saw Tom yesterday and he looked sad.
Are you sure this is right?
Everybody already knew that.
Tom doesn't go to bars.
I know Tom won't want to go with us.
"Excuse me, where's the exit?"
What's in your car?
You got that right.
You look really great.
What's your cat's name?
Could you explain?
How could that happen?
Tom said that he was already married.
A parrot can mimic a person's voice.
I don't know why that's hard to believe.
You must make a choice.
Everybody's worried.
Tom knew that I was desperate.
We'll meet again.
Twenty-five hundred British soldiers guarded the border.
I haven't told Tom yet.
It's not polite to speak with your mouth full.
I've decided not to go to Boston.
I've just spoken to Tom about that.
"No matter what happens, I'll always love you."
I have a terrible pain.
The whole building was deserted.
How dare you say such a thing!
Tom drives me mad.
Tom aimed at the target.
It's a worldwide problem.
Mary said she wanted to marry me.
I just wanted to make you happy.
His plan was discarded.
The door was opened.
How did your speech go?
You can never catch Tom off guard.
I know that Tom doesn't often win.
I had no idea that you didn't like Tom.
We really do need to talk.
What would you do?
What museums would you recommend that I visit?
Tom gave a rose to Mary.
I'll never ask Tom for help again.
Tom has promised to help.
What movie did Tom want to see?
Why can't we swim here?
I'll consider that possibility.
Tom does anything we tell him.
You know I like you.
I can't say I wasn't disappointed.
Another problem has come up.
Tom needs to help us today.
He couldn't bring himself to shoot the deer.
Have you told anybody?
I thought you were my best friend.
Why do you continue to argue with Tom?
Thank you for all you've done.
I'm glad you came.
Tom really meant it.
Do you think it's funny?
I don't have anything to complain about.
Tom didn't want to explain anything.
I thought you understood me.
I wrote a letter to my mother last night.
House prices are up.
I'm sure Tom hasn't forgotten about the meeting.
That's a copy.
Tom knows a lot of proverbs.
They sell candy.
Tom decided to try.
I am very surprised that she became a Diet member.
What state is Boston in?
Tom got out of his car and opened the trunk.
Does Tom want me to drive him to the airport?
I can't allow it.
I'm going to stay home tonight.
Who told you to write with your left hand?
I've already caused Tom a lot of trouble.
Do you want to go to the zoo with me?
This fish is not edible.
Tom isn't the one that cried.
What has Tom done wrong?
I've been waiting for this moment all my life.
I see you haven't lost your touch.
You've got a big hole in your sock.
This seems risky.
Tom doesn't know how to play the piano.
Tom advised Mary to take her umbrella with her.
I'm convinced Tom did nothing wrong.
He's over forty.
We can do without that.
It's important that you practice every day.
I know that Tom cheated.
He thinks that planes are safer than cars.
I remember mailing the letter.
Who are you texting?
"This way, gentlemen!"
I didn't want to kill Tom.
Please remember to water the garden.
Tom said he would leave on Monday.
I've always considered you a close friend.
The accident wasn't my fault.
Tom threw me an apple.
It was very cold that evening.
I seem to have overdone it.
I wasn't too hungry.
How much water do you drink a day?
Tom says you may not need it.
Do you know where Tom is taking us?
I think you're jealous.
She is wearing an expensive necklace.
It looks like this car is his.
She was buried in her hometown.
It is a pleasure to watch a baseball game on TV.
I met a girl.
I didn't notice that my fly was open.
That country has natural resources.
How do you feel about his suggestion?
Probably not even Tom knows what to do.
I've crossed the Atlantic several times.
The table is wobbling.
"For goodness' sake, don't say that!"
My parents never punished me.
Why were you angry with me?
Don't compare yourself to me.
I said we'd find Tom.
Tom is working as a software engineer.
It's in the kitchen.
Thank you for picking me up.
Tom says this is the best he can do.
I didn't think you were jealous.
I don't think that Tom knows why you want me to do that.
I'm resting.
It all happened so fast.
We can't sleep because of the noise.
Tom went to sleep.
Didn't you know I wanted to do that?
I heard you are going to get married.
I don't think that anyone else wants to do that.
He is considered trustworthy.
Tom found the wallet he thought he'd lost after searching the house from top to bottom.
I sent you some flowers.
This is the one I like best.
It happened at a quarter past eleven.
I already told you what happened.
I wanted you to like me.
They're joking.
Did you hear about what happened to me?
This milk tastes odd.
They heard wolves howling in the distance.
Tom is likely to be frustrated.
The fog lifted quickly.
My friend said he had bought a new watch.
I won't do this again.
I know you're looking at me.
Did you ask the price?
I've always liked baseball.
You'll get what you deserve.
It has stopped raining.
Are you happy?
How long has it been since you've had a girlfriend?
Our refrigerator isn't working.
I don't need Tom's help anymore.
Do what I tell you to do.
I had to do that by myself.
Are there a lot of Africans in Germany?
"If you don't like this, you don't have to eat it."
I told Tom that it was a risk.
Tell me why you went to Boston.
Do you keep your money in a bank?
We're very fast.
Every person is unique.
Don't talk to me about Tom.
Nature is changing.
Are you leaving Boston?
Work began almost immediately.
I don't want to discuss it.
Tom will visit Mary tomorrow.
You deserve a pay raise.
You're only three years older than me.
He lost everything he owned.
I left immediately.
Does that amuse you?
I forgot to call him today.
The rice was still warm.
Tom needs to stay in bed.
I can't move.
Does Tom walk to school?
Can you do a headstand?
My father has never gotten sick in his life.
I'd like to ask Tom what he means.
Tom will give it to Mary tomorrow.
You won't need a gun.
Please move this stone from here to there.
The forest was very still.
I've asked you repeatedly to do that.
I don't drink tea.
Can we talk in private?
We don't have any questions.
I took Tom's picture.
Tom may change his mind later.
Do you have a showroom for your products in the city?
Tom saw us do that.
It was silly of you to make such a mistake.
I saw you spying on Tom.
I don't remember him saying that.
Tom drew a picture of a dog.
Tom says he studies French.
"You don't really believe all those stories, do you?"
The police are questioning witnesses.
Tom thinks Mary is cute.
I think Tom only speaks French.
I'm jealous.
Maybe I threw it away.
Let's work together.
I thought I might be able to help.
I wanted to know about everything.
Tom hasn't done that for many years.
Tom took the blindfold off Mary.
I understand French a little.
I think it's true.
Don't tell Tom. He'll tell everyone.
How did Tom find out about us?
Tom works in a bakery.
How tall is he?
Tom underestimated me.
How long can you hold your breath?
Tom isn't my boss anymore.
Was your father right?
You want answers to questions you shouldn't ask.
The oldest movie theater in town is being pulled down now.
He's a notorious liar.
Tom thinks Mary will be absent.
She shouldn't have written that.
Do you like to study?
I answered your questions. Now let me ask you a few.
Why wouldn't Tom take our offer seriously?
Please stay for dinner.
It sounds strange.
When was the last time Tom was in Boston?
Tom wants me to stop talking to Mary.
I told Tom not to tell Mary about that.
He wrote the report.
We want to work.
Tom lives here alone.
The negotiations failed.
Tom told me he was sleepy.
What did Tom bring?
You must be getting tired of listening to everyone's personal problems.
Get out of my sight.
Tell me what the rules are.
Tom wants advice.
I'm being used.
You can do that later.
I can't believe you did that by yourself.
You drive.
Tom has two jobs.
Tom has already spoken to Mary about that.
I want you to lay back and relax.
Tom told me he'd be home on Monday.
How do you like the climate here?
This reminds me of home.
Nobody knows where it is.
They promised not to go on strike during the conference.
Her voice is pleasant to listen to.
The baby is still sleeping.
Do you think it'll snow tonight?
I helped Tom a lot.
A great man doesn't care about his appearance.
There's been quite a series of accidents lately.
"Instead of taking notes, I spent the whole class doodling."
You're too young to know what a slide rule is.
Tom is my youngest.
We wish Tom the best.
Give Tom something to eat.
The buildings look so tiny.
I never said that to you.
This one's for me.
He lives next door to us.
My sister insisted on going with me.
Tom has to stay in bed.
Tom can't turn Mary down.
Why don't you buy both of them?
Tom cried.
My plan is still better than yours.
It's an illusion.
You must do it.
We were both busy.
Tom wants you to hear this.
Have you checked your email this morning?
You're thin.
How much will we need to pay?
Someone told me Tom has quit his job.
It's not a permanent solution.
Who else agrees with me?
I thought we'd be comfortable here.
That won't be an easy task.
"I looked in the direction of the window, but didn't see anything."
Tom almost married Mary.
Were you on the train?
Have you ever forgotten your wife's birthday?
What'll you do if that happens?
I run every morning.
You should write it down before you forget it.
I give in.
Is it you?
No one saw that.
Where did I put it?
Tom isn't much taller than you are.
Have a good weekend.
I'm sure your intentions were good.
We're not doing anything.
I hate to wait.
Her father is Japanese.
I've got a job to do.
We found something.
I think you must be mistaken.
Tom didn't go to the lake with us.
There's only space for ten people in the lifeboat.
Close the door after you.
Do you know who wrote this novel?
"However hard you try, you can't finish it in a day."
I may have made a mistake.
You should wash your face.
The police are going to arrest Tom.
You will help.
Tom and I'll do all we can.
Tom doesn't know how to milk a cow.
I don't know which one I should buy.
Have you told anyone what your real name is?
I'm horrible.
Have you ever tried doing it this way before?
I don't have a broken arm.
How about you?
The robber escaped being punished.
He bought an English book at a bookstore.
Tom emptied the bucket of water.
I'll do the same thing you do.
I didn't even know that you had one.
There's something we have to do.
I can go next week.
Tell them what you want.
Tom is too young to do that alone.
It was getting louder and louder.
I will get in touch with you.
I called him this morning.
I can easily convince you of his innocence.
I didn't ask Tom to dance. He asked me.
That doesn't matter.
I don't think that Tom knows what Mary wants to do.
Please remove this.
I have a comment.
We miss Tom a lot.
Everything Tom says is a lie.
I swim.
Three options were proposed.
Tom's dangerous.
Do you want me to put Tom to bed?
I wasn't surprised when Tom told me that he didn't want to go to Boston.
Tell Tom to hurry back.
Do I know you?
No alcohol is allowed on campus.
Tom wasn't wearing his new coat.
"If I were you, I wouldn't go to Australia."
Where were you that night?
"I know you've been waiting a long time, but could you wait just a little bit longer?"
Let Tom buy whatever he wants.
Tom ran inside.
Must I do it now?
I used to be able to see the garden from this window.
The buzzer sounded.
Tell him to call me.
Don't walk on the carpet.
Don't look out the window.
In order to keep our feet warm we had to shift from one foot to another and keep moving.
I'm going to miss Tom so much.
Tom has done that on purpose.
"I didn't want his help, but I had to accept it."
I have three cars.
I can't bear to see him cry like that.
"Tom understands what this means, I think."
We have to split.
I don't want Tom to get angry.
It's not easy to translate a poem in a foreign language.
Who are Tom's friends?
Tom knew that Mary was awake.
Don't buy too much.
I'm sure Tom won't forget Mary.
The enemy attack ceased at dawn.
I wondered why Tom wasn't drinking.
The little girl just kept crying.
Let's keep our classroom clean.
We had a good time at a coffee shop.
That's all we know about you.
"Ah, that's much better."
Tom's answers were wrong.
I'm only doing this for your own good.
Twenty miles is a long distance to walk.
One day this caterpillar will turn into a beautiful butterfly.
Your daughter is tall.
I'm convinced that Tom did nothing wrong.
How long will it be?
I'm sorry it took so long.
I don't think Tom knows how to play this game.
Your mom is cool.
Where did you learn karate?
Do you want to leave with Tom?
You're clever.
Tom asked us to stop doing that.
No one was hurt.
I will give you a call as soon as I get home.
We thought it was hilarious.
I've been giving this a lot of thought.
I don't think this rain will let up.
I knew Tom had done it.
Tom went to the kitchen to get a cup of coffee.
Let's do the math.
Has Tom changed much?
What're you thinking?
Do you know when Tom got his driver's license?
Tom has a picture he wants to show Mary.
We rented an apartment.
I must've left it at school.
Don't you think so?
We had no other option.
I don't think it's going to rain today.
Tom was waiting for me in the parking lot.
I hated Tom for that.
Tom didn't even look at it.
Tom was married to a Canadian.
Tell Tom I want to see him first thing in the morning.
Let Tom come aboard.
You think I don't know what's going on?
I'm going with you.
Tom used to eat a lot of junk food.
We're just trying to help you.
I have friends who can help me.
Tom says there isn't any food left.
Tom is still smoking.
Where did you put it?
That's out of the question.
Let's find out for sure.
You ran a red light.
She was merely stating a fact.
Please show me another example.
He has a good head on his shoulders.
They are reading their book.
Tom's delirious.
I'm relaxed.
Do you like pizza?
I don't know anyone here.
When will you come home?
Tom decided not to argue.
Tom and I share a room.
Got it?
Tom is ready to work.
I hope we can fix that.
Do you remember when you last saw Tom?
The bridge was carried away by the flood.
Tom won't be happy.
"If it's raining tomorrow, we'll go there by car."
How many times a week do you take a bath?
I've come to ask you a favor.
I'll split it with you fifty-fifty.
It's sand.
I told Tom you already knew what to do.
Tom could've told me about this earlier.
Do it delicately.
I spent too much.
This job pays pretty well.
Can I get you something to eat?
We were supposed to go together.
I'll make a copy for you.
Tom works at an Italian restaurant.
Tom couldn't fall asleep.
Do you think that's true?
It's stuffy in here. May I open a window?
What could've changed Tom's mind?
I don't think you're right.
They know what Tom wants.
"A lot of people would like to become famous. However, a lot of famous people wish they weren't so famous."
You should've asked me.
Tom saw the cat.
Why didn't you tell me that before?
Are you going?
They don't care about that.
Tom has a good camera.
I hate the winter.
I'll eat the same thing you do.
I forgot to call you.
We have to tell Tom immediately.
You don't have to sing if you don't want to.
Tom is nodding his head.
Tom sobered up a bit.
I wish I hadn't told Tom that I forgot to do that.
Tom wants me to take a picture of his new car.
You deserve a prize.
Did everybody leave?
The red umbrella reminded her of her grandma.
Would you do it?
Tom didn't have to take off his shirt.
Tom wouldn't like it if Mary didn't do that.
Let's go have lunch.
I didn't accept the invitation.
Did you hire Tom?
This is ice.
I don't understand why she doesn't love me anymore.
I don't want to write with this pen.
Did you tell everybody all about me?
"In the absence of sufficient proof, the police could not indict him."
I think that Tom is stuck-up.
Tom's blood type is O positive.
"Tom will win, I'm pretty sure."
That offer sounds too good to be true. What's the catch?
Tom walked out of the room.
He writes Arabic.
Tom looked at me like I was crazy.
How many hours did Tom work yesterday?
I wish I could turn back time.
I thought you didn't believe in ghosts.
Are you sure you don't want to go swimming with us?
You're going to be a mommy.
We have to stand up for minority rights.
Tom was elected in 2010.
I'm not surprised that that happened.
He zipped his bag shut.
My brother has become a priest.
She has many valuable books.
Give me one more chance.
People with autism often don't make eye contact when talking to someone.
You should've come by train.
I suspect Tom won't be doing that today.
Is Tom retired?
Tom clenched his fist.
I knew you'd come home.
I'll be there in 30 minutes.
I wasn't the only one who was late.
Tell me what to do with it.
Thousands of dollars in scholarships go unclaimed each year.
Tom knew too much.
I try to avoid going into the woods after dark.
Tom has to do that.
The door opened and Tom entered the room.
Tom doesn't have a visa.
Tom tried to blame me for everything.
"I'm not afraid of you, Tom."
We just finished painting the house.
I read all your text messages.
When was the last time you ate paella?
Congratulations!
I suspect Tom and Mary aren't in Boston now.
Do you know where your children are right now?
I don't want to get married too early.
Tom isn't the only adult in the room.
Tom has a lot more books than you.
I hope it's OK.
She bought a shirt for him.
Tom never discussed that with Mary.
What would the world be without women?
This magazine has a picture of the Queen.
Tom is in your office.
The classroom was almost empty.
Tom raised his glass to his lips.
I still think Tom is hiding something.
That's a very interesting topic.
Mary found a long blonde hair on Tom's jacket.
Have you ever shot a gun before?
It was a beautiful summer day.
I don't often ask questions.
Now I remember.
Where do you keep your gardening tools?
I don't think that that's why Tom isn't here.
Tom laced his shoes.
Please promise me you won't do that.
Why don't you want to eat lunch with us?
Who's in the basement?
I didn't know how to solve the problem.
Tom bikes to school.
I think you might need my help.
Did I tell you that?
He was strict with his children.
They said you were fired.
What's your reason for doing this?
Tom hates me for no reason.
Is this your first visit to Australia?
Everybody in the room let out a sigh of relief.
Will you sing today?
I waited a whole year for that.
Does someone here speak French?
Will he ever forgive me?
Did Tom take Mary home?
Where's Tom's office?
Come over here.
I am quite comfortable in this room.
They're not telling us the truth.
The idea isn't new.
I got fired for doing that.
I've been worried.
Won't that be dangerous?
Tom is a runaway.
They swam with the dolphins.
"You can't read French, can you?"
Father is now busy writing a letter.
I know that Tom didn't know who should do that.
Tom stayed home all day yesterday.
We'll discuss it.
Tom paid nothing.
It's excellent.
Are you telling me it's my fault?
Where is your classroom?
How can you know that?
Wait a while.
He had an odd look on his face.
Tom is hiding something from me.
Tom likes that dog.
This house isn't very large.
Tom works here.
It's getting bigger.
That was ages ago.
We need another plan.
Aren't you waiting for Tom?
It's already 11.
"Mary wanted to ask a question, but she didn't."
I'm hiding.
We'll call you later.
Maybe I should help you.
We're not wealthy.
I hope you can hear me.
I've got someone with me.
Bring the kids.
I didn't know you were such a good cook.
I think it would be better if you left.
Tom doesn't have any idea what Mary is thinking.
Why don't you just admit that you're wrong?
"When I was little, I was blonde."
It is rumored that the firm is going to tie up with an American company.
I'm living with my mom now.
Tom doesn't want to go for a walk.
I have proof that Tom is the one who killed Mary.
Tom went out to get groceries.
I went to Boston with Tom.
We've already learned a lot.
The work is done.
I think you know who I'm talking about.
How can I find you?
Tell Tom not to be late.
It was a nice race.
I don't think that Tom knows who Mary is.
We must help as many people as we can.
Tom had a chance to meet Mary in Boston.
Feed the bird.
Is Tom at your place?
Take my coat.
You want to get us killed?
Don't close the door.
Tom told Mary that he'd stay at John's place.
"Tom has never dated a girl whose name ends with an ""s."""
Tom told me he needed some money.
You should set a good example to your children.
I think that's enough for today.
It'll cost around ten thousand yen.
Are you fair?
I will do it myself.
Why didn't you try calling Tom?
I'm not used to waiting.
Boston is where I want to be.
Do you drink black coffee?
He did not live up to expectations.
I'm not your friend.
I still respect you.
I wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed your party.
I wish they could find out what's wrong with me.
Tom had icy hands.
Tom adopted Mary's idea.
Can you hear the noise of the waves on the beach?
"Open the window, will you?"
Tom is waiting with Mary.
It wasn't that hard.
Tom didn't like it here.
You're the last person I want to see now.
Why can't Tom sing?
Do you prefer a male or female doctor?
Tom can't stand it.
I've never been more serious in my life.
Tom started a day with a strong cup of coffee.
You did something incredibly stupid.
That game is boring.
Everyone's waiting to see what Tom will do.
You'll regret what you've done.
I have a few easy questions for you.
He talked of her kindness and humility.
Mom said that we can stay up late tonight.
Life is often compared to a journey.
Tell Tom everything I told you.
I got on the wrong line.
Tom was a taxi driver for about three years.
He's out cold.
I totally agree with you both.
Do you know what time the class started?
I liked to draw.
I can easily touch my toes.
I've seen you somewhere before.
A friend told me that story.
It is our obligation to help.
They started kissing.
It looks strange.
I didn't know that you wrote poems.
"It was raining, so I stayed home."
I've just spoken to your French teacher and he says you're doing well in his class.
Tom is a monster.
Who taught you how to do this?
I've got a question I want to ask you.
Her derogatory remarks towards her boss caused her to lose her job.
I think that Tom is gone.
Tom began to cry again.
The man looked at me.
"Which do you like more, skiing or skating?"
Is that Tom's car?
Scorpions are dangerous.
She stopped picking daisies.
Tom questions everything.
I totally agree with both of you.
Tom says he wants to learn how to fly an airplane.
Let Tom finish.
We hurried to catch the bus.
What other options do we have?
Tom told me to answer your questions.
I'm aware of what happened.
I don't want to play with you anymore.
I am studying now.
Tom is still too young to drive.
She speaks German.
The next train to the airport departs from platform 2.
Why don't you go play with Tom?
This movie is worth watching.
I was speaking with Tom.
You're a little weird.
I will do it myself.
Tom fixed it.
I don't like myself.
That won't work.
Tom would never lie to Mary.
I don't wear a watch.
Who's going to try your case?
"You didn't tell them, did you?"
"Which do you like better, Denver or Montreal?"
They're probably drunk.
"It's windy today, isn't it?"
You were right all along.
Tom has agreed to pay us three hundred dollars.
Tom hasn't played the guitar for years.
You won't be able to see Tom today.
We found one.
Tom asked me to sing.
It is no wonder that he has succeeded.
I want to invite you to the party.
I'll pick you up tomorrow evening at 6:30.
Where were you 3 years ago?
I'll discuss the matter with my boss.
Why were you there so long?
I heard about your problems.
I won't wear a jacket if Tom doesn't.
Don't walk alone after dark.
Were you drinking that day?
Tom has already been told not to do that again.
That was just the beginning.
I haven't called Tom lately.
I'll be thirty soon.
"I didn't want to work late, but the boss told me that I had to."
I think my leg is broken.
The flowers smell so good.
Everything's under control.
Don't drink on an empty stomach.
This should fit you.
You'd be perfect for that.
I wanted to leave.
I see a light.
Tom didn't see you.
Tom owes Mary a lot.
We'll need it.
It's funny.
Her grandmother lived to be 88 years old.
I don't like Tom's looks.
I can't buy it because I have no money.
Can you hear me?
I don't believe what you're saying.
Please tell me about your company.
Tom was angry with me.
Tom has been beaten.
Did he ask you to spy on me?
Tom arrived yesterday.
Do you really want to walk to Tom's house?
I got your address from Tom.
Tom tries to read the future.
Just looking at a picture of food makes me feel nauseous.
I was the only one who survived.
Why do I have to work with you?
Don't hesitate to ask me questions.
Tom is used to this kind of work.
I don't know anybody else here.
Did you tell Tom?
Don't tell anyone anything.
We have many reasons to be hopeful.
What time is dinner?
Send it by mail.
I'm a communist.
I know that Tom is a thief.
The bookcase is level with the table.
Tom knows what I'm talking about.
Tom and Mary have both already eaten.
I'm looking for a room.
It's good that Tom didn't win.
You have to change trains at the next stop.
I didn't think he would come.
I have clients waiting.
They didn't do that.
I just want you to be happy.
Don't eat green apples or you'll get sick.
Tom still isn't used to the way things work here.
Why weren't you with us yesterday?
They made Tom chairman.
"When I visited my hometown this summer, I found the city different from what it had been ten years ago."
I am an entrepreneur.
I'm so happy you're back.
I hope you will call again.
I don't think that Tom would make a very good boss.
You're on the wrong floor.
What do we do after this?
Tom sat down on the desk.
"You aren't going to tell on me, are you?"
He is very sensitive to cold.
She always stands up for her convictions.
"I'm sorry, but I don't understand."
I'm not apologizing.
I attended the meeting in place of him.
"I did that and Tom did that, too."
I think they very likely won't help you.
Let's go home early.
I'm often wrong.
Tom didn't have a weapon.
I thought I told you to clean your room.
You missed your chance.
There isn't any hope.
I almost forgot to tell you about what happened.
We've done it.
Thanks in advance for your help.
Tom never talks about his feelings.
Tom is looking for a reasonably-priced used car.
Let me leave!
I know that you won't be here tomorrow.
I love him and he loves me.
I hope you feel better tomorrow.
Are you going to give Tom anything for Christmas?
I'm feeling much better today than I was yesterday.
Can you explain this?
I must remind you about your promise.
The rioters beat many policemen to death.
Tom says that he's lived in Australia his whole life.
No one's upset.
We didn't talk about it very often.
They're all hungry.
They just don't trust you.
Sweden's population is growing.
That'll help.
Where did Tom find it?
I knew that Tom was afraid.
Do you want to be with me or not?
I won't be bothering you anymore.
It has nothing to do with me.
Tom said he wasn't going to wait for us.
How tall is she?
Are you here to see Tom?
Shut up and do what you're told to do.
You can take it.
I didn't think I'd get punished.
It's a misunderstanding.
That's the most important reason.
I cook for Tom.
"Please be on time. If you're late, we'll leave without you."
Don't pretend you don't know what I mean.
This restaurant is good.
Have you ever eaten chocolate-covered popcorn?
You can just leave if you want to.
Don't call Tom that.
You're back.
When did you find out the truth?
Tom made some mistakes on the test.
Give Tom the gun.
The bus Tom is on should be here soon.
Do you want kids?
He is rich and I am poor.
I can't open this door.
Tom is a Canadian guitarist.
Tom opened the door and walked inside.
I don't think Tom was ready.
I arrived there too early.
When did Tom tell you that?
That's what troubles me.
What'll you give me?
I think you know exactly what I'm talking about.
She tried in vain to please him.
Life's not easy.
I was sentenced to three years for robbery.
I told Tom to see the dentist.
I think we could do that.
Tom was wrong yesterday.
"I didn't want to get married, but my parents forced me to."
Just please do that.
What movie did you see?
Tom is a pretty capable guy.
"To tell the truth, I don't agree with you."
Is that genuine?
I think Tom understands all that.
Tom stayed calm.
Tom came to my rescue.
Do you really think Tom is rich?
Tom resolved to stop calling himself an idiot.
Tom missed the last train and spent the night at an Internet cafe.
Thank you in advance for your help.
I have to feed my cat.
Tom left without me.
Tom's car is blue.
I didn't know that Tom had been sick.
I thought Tom was your husband.
Tom repaired his watch by himself.
He's really angry.
The noise was a nuisance.
You had a chance.
Tom went on a camping trip.
I need water.
Tom thinks schools should teach children to obey authority.
He was determined to finish the work at any cost.
Tom wants to eat some apple pie.
I predicted it.
You may use mine if you want to.
I'm now married.
Tom is always smiling.
I'm trying to be fair.
Tom asked me why I was laughing.
The owl gave a loud screech.
Tom looked at the menu.
It looked like you didn't want to do what you were doing.
Tom loves flowers.
Tom passed away yesterday.
I remember telling you about it.
I have no idea where I am.
Sometimes I struggle to speak English.
Do your children know French?
Here's the money I owe you.
You're so beautiful!
I completely agree with you.
"The next time I'm in Boston, I'll try to visit you."
Tom is lazy and spoiled.
We can't let them kill Tom.
We have to reduce the national debt.
The fire burnt ten houses down.
Can you read this manuscript?
We'll capture them.
What do I know?
Do you like jazz?
I went to the dance with Mary.
Tom is an amazing songwriter.
I don't know how noodles are made.
Shut the window.
I don't understand you at all.
Where would you like to meet?
I wasn't going to say anything.
We need a group of people we can rely on.
There was food enough for us all.
Why don't you show Tom how to do that?
I asked him about the accident.
Children like fruit juice.
Do you agree with their decision?
I almost always take a bath before dinner.
The only ones who know for sure are Tom and Mary.
I wonder what Tom will tell us.
I've made a list of foods that I can't eat.

I thought Tom was at school.
Tom said that he was wounded.
You're too hard on yourself.
I didn't even know you were married.
"Who are you, and what are you doing here?"
This letter isn't for you.
Tom would've liked you.
"If you go, I'll go, too."
Your brother won't buy it.
Your fate is in my hands.
Tom's friends knew he couldn't speak French.
Why don't we do that tomorrow?
Would you rather live in a big city or a small town?
I've already been here for three hours.
Don't say too much.
I should've studied for the test.
I can do this.

Were you the one who told Tom about what happened?
I wanted to ask you a question.
Tom thinks I'm right.
"Bring me the newspaper, please."
I'm still not ready.
I learn French at school.
Why are you in Boston?
I came to thank you.
I hope that you will get well soon.
I still haven't decided where to go.
Both are alive.
His sad story touched my heart.
It's not easy to speak a foreign language.
I'll never set foot in this house again.
It was hard at first.
"Tom will follow my advice, I think."
Tom was in a wheelchair.
What a big cake!
I've given you everything.
I still need to see if Tom wants to go with us.
You will soon hear from him.

Did you think I wouldn't notice?
Tom is still lonely.
This isn't for me.
I spoke to Tom yesterday.
I hear voices in my head.

"You're a good assistant, Tom."
I have no idea what's going on there.
I'll join you.
He told me about the accident as if he had seen it with his own eyes.

What will happen will happen.
We're planning a robbery.

You're all very nice people.
They look like they're having fun.
Tom took a short cut.
When will dinner be ready?

The children left for camp this morning.
I don't think I'm the only one here who speaks French.

He is working as a security guard at a warehouse.
He is the best player on our team.

All of us know Tom.
Go up these stairs.
I never imagined anything like this.
Can I at least hug you?
Do you have time to help me?
I'm horrible.

I only meant to scare Tom.
How could you not tell me you know my parents?
I'm not that desperate.
"So, Tom, are you doing anything tonight?"
It doesn't matter anyway.
Do you know the bus driver?
Tell me what's going on.
There's someone behind you.
Has Tom ever told you how he lost his leg?
Don't tell Tom the answer.
Tom is making lunch.
Tom wants to talk to Mary.
"How tall are you, and how much do you weigh?"
It's all Tom's.
Please don't tell Tom.
We're leaving right away.
Everyone is happy.
Were you working last night?
Tom didn't want to think about it anymore.
I need to talk to one of you.
Empty your pockets.
Tom annoyed me with a lot of questions.
I am not sure whether I will be able to come with you.
Let's not jump to conclusions.
Both Tom and Mary know it wasn't John who did that.
I hid myself behind the door.
What are you two doing?
It was raining that day.
How do we make this problem go away?
Can I cancel this ticket?
Did you see your friends last week?
I think Tom is clever.
She asked me to pick her up at the station.
"The letters were from Tom, not from Mary."

We're glad to have you both here.
We are with you.

Why are you doing that today?
The water will soon drain away.
It is two miles from here to the park.
You need to go.
She turned a page of her book.
Could you gift wrap it?
I'll know tomorrow.
I got married yesterday.
What could happen?
Come fishing with me.
You don't have to thank me.
I know a guy in Boston.
I convinced Tom to go to the party.
They are all the same.
Tom wanted to please the crowd.
She looks happy.
You've done enough already.
Did you mean that?
You're very rude.
This concerns you.
I'm still the same person I used to be.
There's no blood on the floor.
We're going to go back to basics.
Tom is making a list of what he needs.
I stopped by Tom's school on the way home.
"After his wife died, he lived for quite a few more years."
I was hoping you'd find something.
You're the oldest.
Tom called Mary a couple of times last week.
I read the label.
Does Tom know you like him?
You have blood on your hands.
Do you still live with your parents?
Hold on a second.
I think we should concentrate on other things.
No two words are identical in meaning.
I have another assignment for you.
It is more than five years since I last saw him.
I strongly suggest you visit Kyoto.
I hope Tom doesn't let us down.
I did that the wrong way.
Tom had one child.
This was a mistake.
I will stop it.
I believe that I can trust you.
Cut them with a knife.
Tom was on edge waiting for news of how Mary's surgery went.
Be tolerant.
"You read a lot, don't you?"
Tom and Mary are both from Boston.
Take only one.
Tom isn't here today.
Open this door.
I had sore legs the next day.
He kept me waiting.
I'm not hungry at all.
"Could I have a knife and fork, please?"
Where did Tom buy this?
Please don't be mad.
I heard him humming in the shower.
He wanted to be in the newspapers.
Both Tom and Mary speak French.
Tom's eyes were open.
Tom has tricked us.
Tom was quick to volunteer.
Tom is not as fat as I am.
I'm not a teacher.
Is there a park near your house?
I kept on reading.
Let's eat first.
I know myself very well.
Won't you meet me halfway?
You two make a beautiful couple.
She's a wonderful wife and mother.
Do you think that Tom is busy?
I hope that won't happen again.
We went to Boston last week.
They can afford it.
Tom will fix that.
Tom wants Mary to come here right away.
Tom still hasn't completely recovered.
Tom was wearing a janitor's uniform.
He knows how to dive.
It is important that you should be punctual.
They went on board the ship.
Tom saw his reflection in the mirror.
You need to hear the truth.
There isn't much snow on the ground.
No one has come.
How much time will you need?
Doesn't it bother you?
No one can hear us.
I don't think I snore.
I did it for him.
I watched three movies yesterday.
Why are you crying?
How bad is Tom hurt?
I'll soon catch up with you.
Don't tell anybody where I'm going.
I like both volleyball and basketball.
What's Tom worried about?
What made you decide to come here now?
You're very lonely.
I want to stay here longer.
Does he live here?
Tom isn't too happy.
Tom says he wants to buy a house on Park Street.
Where's my breakfast?
She put the gun to her head.
Is your mom at home?
You can drive if you want.
Why did you buy this expensive dictionary?
Why do you need this?
Do you remember what I told you?
She knows your mother very well.
Let me take care of that.
More men are going to die before this thing is over.
We have plenty to talk about.
I hope you won't tell Tom about this.
Tom canceled his trip.
I told you to leave.
Have you found the leak?
Tom knows who won.
Where do you plan on staying in Boston?
I got back at 2:30.
You never cease to impress me.
I can't do that right now.
You have nothing to fear.
What's the safest way to defuse a bomb?
Tom doesn't like modern architecture.
Tom believes me.
"I told Tom to clean his room, but he didn't."
"To tell the truth, I don't know him well."
Do you know why Tom is crying?
You should've seen the look on Tom's face when he found out.
Tom said I had to leave.
I'm glad you agree with me.
Tom's great-grandfather was the mayor of Boston.
I'm not claustrophobic.
Our team is likely to win.
Who is that stranger?
Tom and I got married this winter.
He kissed his daughter on the forehead.
Are you going to learn English?
When did you take this picture?
I'll help you if you're in trouble.
Don't make Tom angry.
I was a witness.
Are you still a high school student?
I loved that dog.
How are you feeling today?
It's just a novel.
Fear nothing.
Something happened.
I didn't do that with Tom.
You've got to help Tom.
Does Tom know the way?
"I didn't do that yesterday, but I did three days ago."
I think that Tom isn't able to do that anymore.
Tom annoyed everyone with his constant complaints.
She got a flat tire on her way home.
I forgot my jacket.
He works hard because he is anxious to succeed.
Tom is working as fast as he can.
I asked Tom for a favor.
Would you like some more ice cream?
Aren't you and I friends?
Control yourself!
Tom has three cats.
Can you do that in one day?
You're a wonderful human being.
I think Tom would say yes.
Tom was wearing an old pair of shoes.
Would you rather eat a mouse or a tarantula?
"You're in a bad mood today, aren't you?"
I could go with Tom.
Tom is going to have to help Mary.
Just be happy.
"You're not mad anymore, are you?"
Tom didn't even want to go.
Is Tom with you?
Tom thinks that he's the center of the universe.
Why are you imitating me?
Tom eats a lot.
Tom didn't read the contract as carefully as he should have.
Tom is just doing his job.
Were you born here?
Tom isn't old enough to vote.
She died yesterday.
Tom told us what he knew.
Tom denied that he told Mary that.
I'll bring you something to eat.
I think that Tom is still home.
I don't know whose umbrella this is.
Tom doesn't know what made him do that.
They will be surprised to see you here.
Tom will not do it.
Someone is watching Tom.
You should always ask for permission first.
"As winter approaches, the days get shorter and shorter."
Where did you hide my passport?
I don't know anybody in Boston.
Baby teeth are sharp.
Who can run fastest in your class?
Tom is not happy.
Tom didn't need to buy that book.
We met a writer.
The shop was crowded with young people.
He tends to tell lies.
Your French is really good.
I didn't think you'd catch any fish.
I sat down next to him.
Are you absolutely sure it was Tom you saw doing that?
Do you really think Tom is unmarried?
"Did it help? ""A little."""
I've only spoken to Tom once.
They were soldiers.
Tom is a botanist.
Put handcuffs on him.
Rural life appeals to me very much.
She got her left hand burned.
The Milky Way is huge.
He lived there completely alone.
I thought I heard the doorbell.
Just be strong.
I'll be honest with you.
Are you sure you don't want to move to Boston?
Tom doesn't care what Mary says.
Tom discussed the details with Mary.
A pair of gloves was left in the taxi.
What a lovely morning!
We knew we could do it.
I have to work today.
Don't let people take advantage of you.
I wonder why Tom is so upset.
I think Tom wants you to do that.
You work for me.
What did the police say?
Don't let Tom do it.
We cannot overestimate the value of health.
I know Tom is furious.
Tom knows that I'm married.
Tom is having a crisis.
Tom told me that he was sick.
You must be careful when talking to a European.
I'm going to apply for that job.
That's Tom's hat.
We'll come with you.
Am I making sense?
I just don't want to lose you.
The audience stopped clapping.
What time will you arrive?
Tom hid himself behind the door.
I remember all that.
Tom often plays guitar with Mary.
We flew business class.
I think I know your brother.
How did Tom get you to sing?
He made a thorough analysis of the problem.
I've decided to start taking piano lessons.
Can you afford a car like this?
"Compared to our house, yours is a palace."
Tom moved out to Los Angeles to become an actor.
Are you going to help us tomorrow morning?
A fork is missing.
Tom was the only one who knew that.
There is nothing that can't be bought with money.
I asked Tom what he meant.
Tom died with a knife in his back.
Tom put the apples on the table.
Tom needs urgent help.
"Tom did that again, didn't he?"
Rome is in Italy.
He was the one who suggested it.
Tom doesn't have to eat this.
Tom's house is easy to find.
I told you I didn't know.
Would 9 o'clock be all right?
I met her on the street.
Tom invited Mary in.
You had better take her advice.
Tom is going to have to stay in the hospital for another three weeks.
"In London, quite a few musicals and plays are presented at the theaters every night."
You don't need my help.
Do you want to kill me?
Please don't hang up.
Tom says that he studies French.
Did you all go?
You don't have any reason to be jealous.
Tom usually does his homework before dinner.
He opened the cage and set the birds free.
Neither Tom nor Mary was surprised.
Tom says he can't speak French.
I'm sure Tom told you the truth.
They traveled together.
Tom had blue eyes.
I doubt if he will come.
Shut the door behind you.
Tom is the only one who didn't cry.
What a selfish woman!
Tom visited us yesterday.
I don't want to know.
You're invited.
The weather here is very unpredictable.
I won't stay here alone.
Tom is waiting for someone.
He can no longer wait.
The wind is blowing hard now.
We could see enemy ships on the horizon.
You do ask a lot of questions.
"If you need to leave, then leave."
Tom told me all about what had happened.
Tie your dog to that tree.
I was going to tell you.
You're my woman.
I wasn't expecting to see you here.
That's why you're still single.
Which team will win?
Tom doesn't understand why Mary is so popular.
"Listen, I have to go."
Could you turn the volume down?
"Africa is a continent, but Greenland is not."
She put on dark glasses to protect her eyes from the sun.
I don't think the pain will ever completely go away.
I remember the day I met you.
My school is near to the station.
Tom didn't believe Mary would win.
I'll answer you tomorrow.
I wonder why Tom wants that.
We hope you'll succeed.
Why did Tom do this?
Tom shouldn't have said that.
My wife cooks well.
This is mystifying.
Tom said goodbye to his sister.
Tom adores Mary.
I'll keep an eye on Tom.
We know you lied about Tom.
I can see a difference.
Every woman is different.
That's exactly what he said.
Everybody saw what happened.
Tom didn't like the taste.
"I didn't know the city, and what's more, I couldn't speak a word of the language."
Please make my bed.
They want to make it bigger.
I'm leaving you.
No one threatened Tom.
You know it's true.
I hear Tom has quit school.
You're a terrible liar.
"When I have homework to do, my brother always helps me with it."
I never trusted Tom.
I'm not leaving with Tom.
I want political asylum.
I think you should come back to Boston.
I read in the paper that he was murdered.
We'll be back in three hours.
Thank you for buying food.
You were mine.
Reading helps you build up your vocabulary.
Tom didn't like that movie at all.
I'll go tell everybody.
How's it going with your family?
Do you have any idea who did this?
Did you know Tom is planning on moving to Boston?
Tom went to Mary's.
You'll die in jail.
I only need one.
"Eventually, Tom found out what had happened."
It's my business to investigate such things.
That's happened to me plenty of times.
Tom reached for his weapon.
You must do exactly as I tell you.
My father is home.
I heard that Tom got married to a rich woman.
I didn't invite Tom.
The fact that he did not accept any money shows that he is an honest man.
I don't know anything yet.
These sunglasses were very expensive.
She has even teeth.
What do you want for dinner?
Can I ask you something personal?
I'm having an awesome time.
You're the only one I trust.
I need to get my oboe repaired.
The dog is beautiful.
The net is huge.
Why didn't he go to Germany?
Tom said he'd do that as well.
I live in a hotel.
You may make use of his library.
Not everybody will be able to understand this.
Tell me more about yourself.
You're safe here.
What's it used for?
The thing that impressed me the most in China was the Chinese.
This tie goes very well with your shirt.
This time you won't be alone.
Do you speak the same language to your father that you speak to your mother?
I'd like to come over after work.
Everybody wanted to sing.
Please come to my house.
You had better go to the dentist.
She's a single mother of two.
I want to be careful.
Get out while you can.
Your handwriting is quite elegant.
He never asked me.
Don't disturb the others.
This is the man that I see every day on the train.
I don't think Tom knows Mary is here.
I think we're about ready.
She has a long nose.
Do you know what that was?
That was your third drink.
It does bother me.
"If people never fell in love or got their hearts broken when love fails, what would lyricists write their songs about?"
Here comes the cavalry.
Does Tom know I want him to win?
The captain was so angry he refused to give the crew shore leave.
The door won't budge.
They oppose the plan to raise taxes.
How long have you been in prison?
I lost my money.
It is impossible for him to become a doctor.
Is doing that really all that difficult?
Tom is planning a trip to Australia.
We rented an apartment when we lived in New York.
I knew Tom would suspect me.
Do you know where she is?
The speed limit was 60 mph.
Grab that.
Every student who has graduated from our university has studied English with a native speaker for at least two years.
The door was unlocked.
Add more salt to the soup.
That's the current plan.
I don't think TV will ever take the place of books.
Do you want this job or not?
I'm afraid Tom can't come.
Please tell Tom that I won't do that.
Tom said that you were going to Boston.
Tom said that Mary was cold.
I have to prepare for the English test.
I wish the subway wasn't so crowded every morning.
Tom hoped that Mary was all right.
She waited for you for two hours.
Please tell the truth.
He is too old.
Tom wasn't as busy as you were.
She finished writing a letter.
We're still here.
I think a part-time job is a good experience.
Tom knocked him down.
I'm unnecessary here.
I know that you're guilty.
I do need you.
Call the police.
I have a question I want to ask you.
Tom asked if Mary really had to do that by herself.
I think she is sick. She has a temperature.
I'd like to buy a small mirror.
Aren't you frightened?
It's a bad example.
Tom spent a lot of time in Boston.
You know it better than anyone else.
"I don't like it, but I will do it anyway."
I knew Tom would be able to win.
Tom and I are no longer living in Boston.
I'm brave.
Why would he lie?
Please watch closely.
He knew he did not have much longer to live.
We joined the country club.
Now what do we do?
I'm not even surprised.
The boat is sinking.
Your daughters have turned into women.
Tom's famous.
He crossed the river in a small boat.
I can't find my ticket.
What size shoes does Tom wear?
I'm very busy here.
Please fix this.
Don't tell lies.
It's dead.
You don't have a temperature.
Tom works for a large company.
Tom didn't know what Mary was thinking.
Do you sell newspapers here?
"Tom, I want you to meet Mary."
You're the only one who understands me.
I wanted to thank you.
Tom used to live in the woods.
You're very wise.
I thought we'd be able to do that.
It's just a figure of speech.
Tom won't be able to work tomorrow.
Tom often helps me in the garden.
Tom wouldn't tell us anything.
I know one of Tom's sisters.
Tom isn't where I told him to wait.
"You don't want to go, do you?"
Do you really believe that?
We'll call you.
I just had a talk with your teacher.
I want to marry a girl like her.
No one listens to me.
No one comes to visit us anymore.
Tom seems friendlier than before.
"I'm sorry, but I can't go with you."
Tom is the one who told me how to do it.
Tom was content.
She came back ten minutes after the explosion.
Could you please translate this for me?
I didn't make those answers up.
What are you going to do with this car?
What makes you think I want this?
Please wait at home.
Tom is a lousy kisser.
Tom has a decent salary.
What makes you think Tom can do this?
I do that almost every day.
Tom is deaf in the left ear.
That would be very unfortunate.
He prepared carefully for the meeting.
You know that I hate spinach.
There is little wine left in the bottle.
We'll meet again.
Tom likes to watch action movies.
Things can't be all that bad.
Tom said that he wasn't used to this kind of hot weather.
Please iron this.
Tom is lying on the sofa.
Tom has learned a few words of French.
This old bread is as hard as a rock.
Tom told Mary he'd study French.
The country's economy is about to collapse.
"Which would you prefer, this one or that one?"
"As far as I know, what he has said is true."
I'm looking for Tom. Do you know where he is?
I don't have a problem with that.
I know that isn't ketchup.
I have bad news.
I hated Tom.
Tom is the only one who was injured.
Would you eat this?
The train will depart soon.
She plays the violin very well.
Tom wasn't tired.
I'm being careful.
I'm expected.
Tom and Mary were talking quietly in the kitchen a few minutes ago.
Tom told me how to do that.
It's up to us.
I was surprised when Tom asked me to play tennis with him.
Tom spent quite a lot of money for his house.
I have to apologize.
Are you really going to Boston next weekend?
Tom gave Mary a sinister look.
Give us a break.
I don't want to lose you.
Tom said he asked himself that same question.
I know it now for sure.
Do you know the answer?
I need to buy one.
I want to sing.
I don't need it.
Could you open this can for me?
I want you to go to the doctor.
I'm going to start with this one.
Tom is going to tell the truth.
What else can I give you?
I wasn't the one who ate all the ice cream.
The train's about to leave. Hurry up.
We're all trying to win.
How old is Tom now?
It has become noticeably colder.
Tom phoned to say he couldn't come.
I will look it up in the dictionary.
You're actually wrong.
Tom grew up in an orphanage.
I assumed that you were happy.
The toilet is clogged.
I'm not armed.
It was your own fault.
I got up early today.
The first girl I ever kissed was Mary.
We have a meeting.
What did Tom do that made you so angry?
I saw some birds flying away.
That's my medicine.
We've been asked to help.
What time do you plan to be home tonight?
Are you willing to go to the beach?
I voted for you.
I don't think I'm unbeatable.
I've gained weight.
Tom swore that he'd quit smoking.
The pitcher was Tom.
Tom and I've forgiven Mary.
It's unbelievable.
I have the house all to myself.
Tom wanted to return to Australia.
A parrot can imitate human speech.
"OK, what's the secret?"
Tom was released from prison three weeks before Mary was murdered.
Tom didn't know Mary last year.
I heard a noise upstairs.
He tends to think of everything in terms of money.
Tom had no money to pay for a cab.
It was just a guess.
"Have you seen Tom? ""Not in the last few days."""
Do you think I've put on weight?
"Roll up your sleeve, please."
Why do they call New York the Big Apple?
I didn't know Tom could sing so well.
I've discussed this with Tom already.
You aren't invited.
I've got good news and bad news.
You're not late.
That's what you told me.
I'm glad you suggested this.
Tom looked like he hadn't slept in days.
Why do you like it?
"I understand what you're asking me to do, but I won't do that."
You're the most beautiful women in the world.
Do you know what time it is?
I don't have anything to read.
"However hard you try, you can't finish it in a day."
Why are you still standing?
I've already apologized to Tom.
They supplied money to him.
"I miss you, too."
Is it serious?
I don't think Tom is in Boston.
I don't work on Sundays.
The dance was the most brilliant affair of the season.
I want to ask Tom some questions.
Tell her that I am listening to music.
He showed me the ropes.
We're moving next month.
She glanced shyly at the young man.
I asked her to wait a minute.
Tom and I are very close friends.
Tell Tom what you want.
I knew that Tom would likely not need to do that.
I'll give you anything you ask for.
That's really odd.
I'm impartial.
This is all unnecessary.
We'll definitely ask Tom to do that.
This is obviously wrong.
The orchestra began to play.
I did what was necessary.
Tom is richer than you might think.
Which one is more expensive?
I've known Tom since I was little.
Tom lived in Australia in 2013.
Aren't you a little young to be doing this?
You're dangerous.
This is something that only Tom can do.
"The sooner you clear the matter up with Tom, the better."
You're very busy.
Girls are crazy.
"Tom knew where Mary was, but he wouldn't tell the police where she was."
I asked Tom a question.
Teach me how to do it.
Now it's time for the weather forecast.
It's money down the drain.
Didn't you know Tom and I were married to each other?
I think I'll be busy this week.
Tom's fingerprints were on the gun.
Tom claimed he saw a UFO.
It is too difficult a problem for me to solve.
Tom is still upstairs.
I know you're working for Tom.
Never give up hope.
I swear I'll pay you back.
Did Tom ask about us?
Wisdom is better than riches.
They're using you.
Tom is very tall.
You have only to ask for it.
I'm looking for a certain old woman.
Do you want to hear the new song I'm working on?
Tom isn't the right choice.
Tom couldn't bring himself to do that.
Fill up this pail with water.
Tom washed the dishes.
I don't know what he's trying to say.
Will you have a little time this weekend to help me with my French?
I didn't want Tom to see me in handcuffs.
Tom did everything Mary did.
Tom said he didn't know.
I'll give it to you tomorrow.
Tom seems to be getting nervous.
We finish each other's sentences.
Tom wants to find another job.
I'm still on vacation.
She was born in England.
"Tom said he'd do that, too."
"What's Tom going to do? ""He didn't say."""
I think Tom is homesick.
Tom wanted the kiss to last forever.
I can fix almost anything.
Let's rest.
We're moving to Boston in a year.
Tom has made himself comfortable on the sofa.
Let's get Tom out of the water.
Tom knew what Mary wanted him to do.
I haven't got it yet.
Tell me how to solve the problem.
A hideous monster used to live there.
I hope Tom will do that.
Why do you need a hammer?
I'm so glad.
Tom was arrested on Monday.
What are we fighting for?
I can't come with you.
I'm facing prison.
I'm confident I can do that.
I owe my success to his help.
There's a reason for that.
Tom said he wanted to study abroad.
I want you to return to your seat.
What's your older sister's name?
Was it really Tom?
The architect achieved worldwide fame.
There's one thing I didn't mention.
Tom is about the same weight as you.
Tom is hoping you'll do that.
Tom locked himself in his bedroom and turned off the light.
Can't we tell Tom about it?
"To some extent, you can control the car in a skid."
We know it works.
I don't really understand.
Do you drink coffee?
I intend to go there.
I told Tom I wanted him to do that.
Tom can help me.
I think about her often.
Tom is boiling an egg.
Tom just needed a little more money.
Why don't we talk about it now?
Put it on the floor.
You must always do what is right.
Is that a new shirt?
I've done that already.
I thought you were coming today.
May I take off my coat?
It's your turn to take out the garbage.
Time's on my side.
He is used to getting up early.
You've definitely gotten better at French.
Tom has helped me many times.
What's your size?
The captain is dead.
Don't talk so loud.
Is it cloudy?
He survived being struck by lightning.
Tom couldn't conceal his disappointment.
Tom Jackson is our only suspect.
I will take you home.
Tom believes the system is broken.
Tom says he knows why Mary didn't do that.
You won't regret hiring Tom.
She accused me of telling a lie.
Can you do it or not?
Tom knew everybody by name.
Many of my friends can speak French.
Tom knew he wouldn't be arrested.
Tom did a lot of things right.
We need to find out what happened to Tom.
Promise you'll tell Tom about this.
I don't want to end up in court.
She was wearing a black hat.
What do you think they'll do to Tom?
I've been to America twice already.
Read whatever you like.
You can invite anyone you want.
Why were you so surprised?
He likes animals more than people.
You should buy Tom some new toys.
I knew what had happened.
I don't like working at the bank.
I've done that many times.
Tom was eating alone.
Throw it there.
I knew you'd be late.
I hope we meet again.
"What have you found, Tom?"
I think you paid too much for that.
What's your horse's name?
"Could I get some water, please?"
"Whether you like it or not, you have to go."
We're going to need your help.
How is the family doing?
The bread is old and hard.
I got a letter from Tom.
I hope I can help you.
Tom writes books for children.
You won't have to do that alone.
He pretended not to hear me.
The President vetoed the law after Congress passed it.
I thought Tom sounded happy.
It seems to me that the pictures speak for themselves.
Call me when you can.
I don't want to go back to school. I wish summer vacation would never end.
Is there a picture of Tom in that album?
I have a family myself.
Do you think we're blind?
The boy lost his way in the forest.
Let's take some pictures.
Tom lent me the money I needed.
He married his daughter to a lawyer.
Mary is the prettiest girl in her class.
I was a little disappointed.
Tom can type very fast.
Which one will they choose?
What's the last thing you remember?
Is this your homework?
I think you were wrong.
My father is to arrive in Honolulu at 4:30 p.m.
Tom spoke in an angry tone.
Germany is about half the size of Texas.
It's hard to say.
Tom is just three weeks older than Mary.
I don't think that it's worth it.
I want my key back.
You don't need me anymore.
You're vain.
He ordered them back to the fort.
What happened to Tom could've happened to anybody.
I told you to get out of here.
Tom seems to be suffering from a guilty conscience.
Tom and I live together.
Tom knows he's being lied to.
There is a place for Tom here.
Tom hated his mother.
It is said that he is sick.
You should think about your future.
I wish that I hadn't eaten the sandwich that Tom made for me.
Tom had to say that.
He is a methodical person.
That's all I wanted to hear.
What's on your plate?
You're overweight.
Tom will give Mary everything she wants.
I think you're too picky.
I don't need your money. I just need your time.
I've been to the supermarket.
I want you to help Tom.
Tom could refuse.
Which is the most difficult language in the world?
I haven't done anything wrong.
Tom didn't want to see me.
I need somewhere to stay.
Are those guys from your school?
That would be fair.
Tom told Mary about what he did.
They filmed the entire ceremony.
He's now a college student.
Where are you going to live?
Why are they so upset?
Tell me what has become of him.
Does this still work?
Tom said that he isn't mad at Mary.
I can't forget that.
I have a family myself.
I didn't mean to bother you.
You have nothing.
Just be careful.
"Tom, I disagree with you."
I need to know for sure.
What exactly does Tom have to do?
I just wanted to drop by to say hi.
How much time do we have?
This paragraph is vague.
How many cups do you need?
Tom told Mary he was thirsty.
No one was aware of her literary talent.
Those are empty words.
"She gave me a beautiful clock, but I lost it."
Where do you want us to go?
We didn't know each other at the time.
What did you say yesterday?
I don't think you have a choice.
I don't eat red meat.
Why didn't Tom win?
We're both very upset.
"Come here, all of you."
I will have to be away for some time.
Give them to her.
It looks like an egg.
Tom was sitting next to me.
I'm in the bath.
There's nobody here by that name.
Tom asked me for permission.
I think I'd like some more coffee.
Did you run?
Tom asked Mary many questions that she couldn't answer.
She seems to have a tendency to exaggerate things.
I was expecting Tom to be here.
Make a guess.
Open the box.
I knew you'd never let Tom die.
A new dress was bought for her.
I was in a rush.
Tom knew he'd made a mistake.
"I'll do it tomorrow. ""You said that yesterday!"""
We make decisions together.
I'm not doing anything.
What's Tom baking?
My children are hungry.
I promise I won't hurt you.
He both speaks and writes French.
Do you think this is fair?
Tom didn't give further details.
Tom said almost the same thing as Mary did.
I was able to go to Boston.
Don't leave your stuff behind.
I thought you'd left.
They are loading oil into the ship.
Try not to take yourself too seriously.
Did they tell you who I was?
There are a lot of people and cars in this city. It is a busy city.
I'd like you to leave.
Your pants are unzipped.
I don't feel like playing either.
I just want us to be friends again.
You are my father.
It'll cause trouble.
I know that you'll learn a lot.
I didn't even know that you had one.
Tom's parents are older than Mary's parents.
He was lucky enough to catch the train.
"Everyone laughed, including Tom."
Put your glasses on.
I don't think that anyone can do that.
When was the last time you ate lunch with Tom?
Mary is a good girl.
Do you know what time the post office opens?
I didn't measure it.
I think it's not a good idea.
"She hit me, not him."
That's the hardest part.
Tom hasn't shown up yet.
I think I can beat Tom's record.
When did the meeting start?
"To the Hilton Hotel, please."
Mary had a flower in her hair.
The situation was unbearable.
I think that's a stupid idea.
There is no doubt that he was murdered.
Does this medicine work quickly?
"Actually, I just want to talk to Tom."
How high can you jump?
Tom won't miss you.
I'm hoping for a really big discount.
They supported his right to speak freely.
Tom's fall resulted in life-threatening injuries.
The train for Cambridge leaves from Platform 5.
There's no substitute.
I go there three times a year.
Why doesn't anyone help us?
Why should I talk to you?
He's not very good at it.
I know Tom well.
Why should I care about Tom?
I can't do this without help.
Who has time?
How long is the ticket good for?
They saw you.
Does Tom play tennis?
Tom told me not to trust you.
Do you know what love is?
I woke up in the middle of the night.
I get a call from her once in a while.
I shouldn't have told you about that.
Tom is planning a trip to Australia with Mary.
Tom won the contest last year.
Tom talked Mary into going.
We've got to save Tom.
I've already told Tom he doesn't have to do that.
Tom always sleeps cuddled up to his Teddy Bear.
It's the third of October.
I've never heard Tom sing.
I thought you'd forgotten.
I'm brushing my teeth.
I can't believe that you fell for it.
I can't bear the noise any longer.
It looks cheap.
I always wanted to be a cowboy.
My room is a complete mess.
Tom wouldn't kill anyone.
I didn't dare tell Tom my secret.
I knew this would be hard for you.
It's no use talking to Tom.
What was it that you wanted?
I know what those guys want.
We all agree with you.
I'm not tired yet.
Tom will try again.
Tom's thirtyish.
I think the wind's picking up.
I want you to get started right away.
What's the title of the book?
What else can Tom do?
Tom may not go to Australia with us.
It wasn't easy for Tom to do that.
Don't talk to me about religion.
He believed that the earth was round.
She knows your mother very well.
I'm glad I did that.
We will have to call on our friends to help us.
One of you is lying.
I'm going to marry Mary.
I told you to stay away from me.
You can't pretend that this didn't happen.
"Tom didn't know how long the leftover chicken had been in the fridge, so he erred on the side of caution and threw it out."
Why don't you understand?
I know that you won't like this movie.
You have to talk to Tom.
Tom went inside.
I drive my kids to school every morning.
I want you to cook dinner tonight.
I just want you to tell me why you lied.
What's your favorite shampoo?
I don't want to go back home.
Tom asked me to help him.
God created the world in six days.
You're shy.
I really don't have much time.
Tom only did that because he was drunk.
Tom did what they told him to do.
I want you to know that I won't do that.
We have an important decision to make.
We'll go to Australia and New Zealand.
How's your dad?
Either Tom is lying or Mary is.
We've got to be ready for that.
The cat is brown.
You must go to the dentist.
He always asks the same question.
Unfortunately the store was closed.
He flirts with every woman he meets.
You'll have to tell Tom yourself.
Tom has been drinking a lot since he got divorced.
Don't go in my room.
How could you not know?
It's all your fault.
"We protested, but it was in vain."
We're all angry.
My tie is orange.
We have no school today.
Do you know what happened?
Every bus is full.
When was the last time you called Tom?
Tom isn't a fanatic.
Who do you usually go skiing with?
Most people live in urban areas.
Tom is the best player on this team.
Come back here.
Give me the keys.
I won the lottery.
Tom doesn't need this.
I'm just glad I could help.
Please see that this letter is mailed sometime today.
Tom must've had an alternate plan.
Tom didn't even attempt to help Mary.
Tom gave Mary a key on a silver chain.
I reckon it's about time I went home.
I wear a tie almost every day.
They are always hard up for food.
He's two years older than I am.
I was told not to do that.
Does Tom have experience?
Her house is a few kilometers away from here.
Tom didn't mention that on the phone.
Did you write this fairy tale by yourself?
Do you want them to help you?
Fish live in the sea.
Didn't Tom tell you?
I think that guy is Tom.
He can speak Chinese.
Tom has no idea how to do that.
Tom was covered with mud.
We're having fun.
How did you know Tom was going to be arrested?
Tom said that he was shocked.
I've been looking for Tom.
He's my friend. Do you know him?
Tom doesn't want to talk to you either.
I wanted to help you.
About how much money do you have?
Tom was momentarily silent.
It's my younger brother's.
These days nobody believes in ghosts.
I enjoyed working with you.
You may come tomorrow.
Everybody claps.
Do you have a blog?
We decided to stay.
"When we're together, I don't worry about the future."
Tom used to live on Park Street.
"You still need more sleep, don't you?"
Tom spent time with Mary.
That river is wide.
She told him that her father had died.
You should apologize to her.
I feel lost.
My girlfriend was crying.
A lot of people were waiting for him.
Please tell us the truth.
Do you really think anything will change?
This isn't about them.
I'm being candid with you.
Why don't you come over?
You're not my friend.
I beat him at chess.
Who else ate with you?
"I don't want to kill you, Tom."
These are gifts for my friends.
It is warm there all the year round.
This medicine helps relieve muscle pain.
I know Tom was late.
"I used to eat pizza, but now I don't."
Tom knows more about that than Mary does.
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.
Tom and Mary took their seats.
You're next.
I didn't click the link.
I didn't know Tom was your father.
I'm not offended.
Do what you want with it.
We were forced to defend ourselves.
You saved my life.
I'm adventurous.
Why can't we do it again?
Where's the book I need?
Tom spends a lot of time on the beach.
We talked about this last night.
Most cars have clear glass.
She is good at speaking English.
You wait right here.
It's my ship.
Is that unfair?
He will never break his promise.
Tom speaks with a southern accent.
There are happy people and unhappy people.
Promise me that you'll do that.
Thank you for everything you've done for me.
He fought until the end.
That's an unusual name.
Tom is captain of the football team and is on the baseball team as well.
A right angle has ninety degrees.
I can't find my glasses anywhere.
This could start a panic.
Tom is glad you're here.
Tom's flight has been delayed.
Didn't you know Tom has lots of cats?
Tom nodded OK.
Are you through with the phone?
"Tom, bring me a sandwich."
Neither Tom nor Mary looked disappointed.
Tom decided to marry Mary even though his parents didn't want him to.
I knew that someone would come.
I want a word with you.
This is all I want.
I thought you said you had a dog.
Do you want to tell me who they are?
I don't like raw fish.
Tom is talking to Mary now.
We can order a pizza.
Tom and Mary are bored.
I thought you were together.
Tom doesn't understand why Mary behaves the way she does.
Your question is hard to answer.
Tom loves money.
There's something I've been meaning to ask you for a while.
I couldn't take that risk.
I knew Tom wouldn't pass the exam.
What kind of birthday present would you like?
I knew something like this would happen.
You're back.
I'm so glad you called.
Do you know what would happen if you did that?
Would you like to stay for dinner?
There aren't that many synagogues in this city.
Have you played that game before?
Why is Tom not eating?
I would rather die than do such an unfair thing.
I can't tell you why I was late.
You have to understand that he died.
Tom wouldn't do this.
Where can I wash my hands?
Why do you want all this?
"I have seen ""Star Wars"" twice."
Play it cool.
I stole something from Tom.
I told Tom not to come here.
Tom is a millionaire.
I'll give you an example.
We need to cross the river.
We need more.
"Will he come home soon? ""I'm afraid not."""
My parents got divorced.
Don't take it seriously. It's a joke.
Why do you give Tom money?
We haven't made a decision yet.
What makes you think I trust you?
Tom likes reggae.
My father wanted me to go and see that place.
Do you want my help or not?
Why would I want to help Tom?
I wanted to give Tom some money.
Did you know that Tom doesn't like chocolate?
There's nothing worse than hunger.
Be kind to old people.
I forgive you.
What is it made of?
Tom looked at Mary.
Tom is in Boston on business now.
Tom attacked Mary with a dagger.
Who gave you that package?
I was Tom's teacher.
Tom betrayed you.
It's awfully expensive.
Excess of politeness is annoying.
This photo was taken in Nara.
Tom is more popular than me.
My dog often lies on the grass.
The baby was fast asleep in her mother's arms.
I weigh 130 pounds.
I'll get you another lawyer.
Stop the train.
I could've done that if you'd helped me.
Tell me about it.
Who did you think it was?
I usually do that in the evening.
The prices remain as they were.
What did Tom whisper to you?
I never even saw you.
There's a big storm coming.
You promised that you'd do that.
I'm asking you to do this because I trust you.
Do you want to be famous?
Let's go for a walk after it stops raining.
I only just noticed it.
Do you know how to drive?
I had difficulty in solving this problem.
I'm your new lawyer.
Did I touch a nerve?
Tom says he'll correct it.
Everyone likes winning.
Who do you think they are?
Who should I bring?
I've been trying to fix that.
Tom told Mary about what had happened.
Tom and I bought that house on Park Street.
When exactly did you see Tom?
"At first, I didn't believe you."
Where were they?
Tom lost 30 kilograms.
Tom made us a generous offer.
Tom was punished by his father.
I'm working on a new idea.
We were stuck for hours in a traffic jam.
There is no doubt.
Tom continued eating.
"His house was sold for $10,000."
Tom isn't going to let you die.
I don't care what he says.
Tom can't believe Mary's over thirty.
I kept an eye on Tom.
I owe you an apology.
You might want to go.
It's pretty routine.
Tom locked the door.
Tom didn't stay in Boston very long.
I can't help you because I don't understand French.
We'll probably never know what happened to Tom.
Tom and Mary are almost done.
Tom never told me where he worked.
Did you go out?
He was so tired that he couldn't walk.
An up-to-date edition of the encyclopedia will come out next month.
What time did Tom leave for work?
"According to the thermometer, it's thirty degrees."
Tom isn't going to do that.
I wrote a letter yesterday.
He had to share a bedroom with his brother.
There have been a lot of complaints about kids skateboarding in front of the school.
Tom is cool.
I don't know where Tom bought his computer.
I want everyone to know that I'm not a murderer.
They forgot to wake me up.
It's getting very late.
Tom and Mary wanted to have children.
I still want to talk to you.
Did you bring what you promised you'd bring?
I never thought I'd ever get married.
It's a pity that you can't join us.
He wrote a lot of stories.
I cannot walk any farther.
What does it all mean?
Father is coming home tomorrow.
I ran into the house because it started to rain.
He has only a superficial knowledge of the matter.
May I go to bed?
Tom was here thirty minutes ago.
It happened last year.
We want to tell you something.
I know that won't happen again.
We should never have given up.
I know that that's my ticket.
Tom is certain Mary will win.
Why do you need so many clothes?
I wanted to go home.
I need a loan.
Tom isn't ready to die.
Tom leaned down and kissed Mary.
I've heard that people can eat cat food without any harmful effects.
Keep looking.
Tom is a genius.
Do you think Tom knows what's happening?
Everything is OK. Don't worry.
Tom is three years younger than me.
Everyone seemed very calm.
Tom is going to wait.
Tom made stew for dinner.
They often help each other.
Tom knows something you don't.
I wanted to be like Tom.
I'm surprised you didn't get the job.
Tom said that Mary is sick.
Does he want to look at it?
We'll never forget.
"You aren't listening, are you?"
Didn't you know peanuts aren't really nuts?
Tom is in a safe place now.
Tom said you wanted water.
I didn't know you wouldn't do that.
Tom won't starve.
She acted the part of a fairy.
You'll get into trouble.
Why do you want to study French?
"It's going to rain, for sure."
You don't know whether he has a girlfriend?
Did you remember to buy dog food?
"Wherever you go, I will follow."
I told Tom not to give up.
I'm not as worried as Tom is.
Call an ambulance.
Can you remember where this all started?
I found the broken camera.
You made the right choice.
Haven't I told you this before?
Let's take a break and drink some tea.
I wasn't there when it happened.
Tom played much better today.
We're not young.
We were all alone.
What time should I wake you up?
Women live longer than men in most countries.
The money we offered them was obviously not enough.
Would I kid you?
The baby started to cry.
Don't talk to me about work.
Give us a minute.
I warned you what might happen.
What impressed Tom the most?
Have we made any progress?
My time is very expensive.
I truly hope not.
I hardly knew Tom.
Bring your friends with you.
Would you like me to order it?
I often take a walk before breakfast.
That's pretty hard to believe.
"Hey, open the door."
I'd have waited for you.
I put the key in exactly the same place where I found it.
Playing with fire is dangerous.
Tom snores louder than Mary.
I'm contented.
She and I are Brazilian.
Tell me what your opinion is.
I don't think Tom knows why you're here.
It's not contagious.
Tom said he wasn't going to help us.
Are you ever late for class?
I won't tell anyone you're in Australia.
She killed him with a knife.
Do you have dinner plans?
I have to attend a meeting.
Do you think I'm too tall?
That's the book I told you about.
Can you help Tom and me?
I'll make a bargain with you.
I promise I won't do that anymore.
Tom recently converted to Judaism.
Eventually Tom fell asleep.
Tom tried to sell his old couch.
These items are rather hard to obtain.
Tom's only pretending to be drunk.
We can't leave.
I spend money as soon as I get it.
This is very difficult.
There was silence.
Tom went to the other room.
What's in the living room?
I know you did it on purpose.
Tom suddenly stopped laughing.
Tom stopped writing.
I think this one's better.
Let me help you. Your bags look very heavy.
My best friend is in Rome now.
We've got three whole hours.
Babies cry when they are hungry.
I can't lend this to you.
I can't imagine what you've gone through.
Do you want me to massage your shoulders?
That might not be as difficult as you think it's going to be.
Tom bought it for me.
What do you have?
I wasn't sure how to respond.
I dreamed about you the other day.
Should I tell Tom that you're coming?
I'm bossy.
He is an ardent music lover.
We're unlucky.
"Tom is in the living room, watching sports on TV."
My advice would be to get some sleep now and finish this tomorrow.
We need to get rid of Tom.
It was a hoax.
Where are you going to move?
Tom tried to hide his embarrassment.
Children like climbing trees.
I want you to remember what happened here today.
They are busy.
"You're not Canadian, are you?"
"Before I answer your question, please answer mine."
The boy is jumping.
Are you in a good mood?
Tom and Mary talk a lot.
Are you feeling better now?
I don't like football.
The baby started crying.
Try it again.
Tom made coffee.
How many feet are in a yard?
Do you think that plants feel pain?
He drank a lot yesterday.
It only took Tom a few minutes to fix that.
I've already tried it.
Tell me what's going on here.
This is the guitar that Tom gave me.
Who told you I was back?
I can hear your heart beating.
Tom claimed that he didn't know his beach house was being used for illegal activities.
Are you missing Tom?
Boxers need quick reflexes.
Tom will be back tomorrow.
You can take off the bandage tomorrow.
I totally disagree with Tom.
I'm pleased with the result.
"She seldom, if ever, goes to movies by herself."
Which one will they choose?
I knew Tom would laugh.
What happened to the dog?
Tom thought Mary was going to tell him what to do.
Mary is a nice girl.
You made me lose my mind.
My phone is vibrating.
"Tom bought himself one, too."
You are exactly like your father.
Just stay there.
I don't think that anyone knows yet.
Tom got tired of waiting for Mary.
Give me back the TV remote.
I don't really like Mexican food.
Tom says the house has been sold.
I wrote down that telephone number.
Tom is likely to be in Boston now.
Tom wants to go with us.
How do you know I didn't volunteer?
Everyone seeks happiness.
Tom missed the deadline.
The path between the two houses was blocked by snow.
You need to go on a diet.
They won't listen to you.
"I wanted to discuss this with you yesterday, but you didn't seem to want to listen."
You're upset.
Tom has decided to stay in Boston.
Don't be cruel.
Tom put his gun down.
I have a bad imagination.
It's unbelievable.
Haven't I told you this before?
You have a sense of humor. I like that.
What are you saving up for?
Tom saw the newspaper on the floor and picked it up.
Tom doesn't look like John.
Don't come near me. You're filthy.
Could you explain how the dishwasher works?
Tom told me he had no enemies.
Are you waiting for Tom?
I want to make sure you are who you say you are.
Maybe she will not come.
It is not easy to learn a foreign language.
I'm glad you're all right again.
How many more years do you plan to work?
I haven't looked inside this box yet.
Please speak quietly.
Tom really helped me out.
You could have drowned.
He didn't stop talking.
There'll be a problem.
I never said I wouldn't go.
Drop the knife!
I will go abroad next year.
Aim at the target with this gun.
Smile.
They won't allow it.
I'll pick you up around 2:30.
I saw him enter the room.
I'm a little drunk.
He can't come with us.
I am okay.
I waited for thirty minutes.
Is Tom working today?
He's afraid of dogs.
Tom plays the violin very well.
I didn't recognize your voice.
It's clear Tom took the wrong bus.
I don't have time to help you today.
I just got promoted.
There's nobody else here.
Is Spanish spoken in Mexico?
Get out of my bed.
I'm sure Tom is grateful for your help.
I'm not likely to need a gun.
There's no talking to him when he's angry.
Tom was surrounded.
I'm not likely to be the first one to do that.
The children are our future.
I was just unlucky.
I will come if I can.
You're very resourceful.
What makes you think I'm rich?
I thought you wouldn't recognize me.
I don't remember who gave this to me.
Tom lost his favorite toy.
Tom has already decided who to go with.
She's a good liar.
"Everyone wants to go to heaven, but nobody wants to die."
Is this dog yours?
It's not your style.
I promise I will protect you.
You have to come.
Collect your things and leave.
Tom didn't put up a fight.
You have to do it again.
The girl said nothing.
I told Tom to leave as soon as possible.
"So, what's the problem?"
I know that you'll do what's necessary.
I suggest you do that by yourself.
We definitely need Tom's help.
I want to take a plane back to Boston.
Is it possible to talk now?
Leave the poor girl alone.
I managed to get in.
Please give me the letter.
I know you're afraid of snakes.
I hate terrorist organizations.
What are you doing for Christmas?
Men don't cry.
Tom played with his dog.
"They are building an apartment building next door, which will ruin our view."
How do you relax after work?
Tom forced me to do that.
Tom is voting.
I always said no.
That tie looks good on you.
Don't you know each other?
Tom has been asked to do that already.
This is the hardest thing I've ever done.
Tom liked what Mary said.
We'll all miss you when you're gone.
We used to swim in this river a lot.
I don't really understand your question.
I was born and raised here.
I have a friend who feeds his dog strawberries.
I see I was right.
This ticket is non-refundable.
Tell me where it is.
Tom acknowledged what he'd said earlier wasn't true.
They moved closer to each other.
Tom is still in his pajamas.
He finished reading the book.

You're very young.
I'm glad you replied.
Country life is very peaceful in comparison with city life.
Tom owes Mary a lot of money.
"If Tom comes, please tell me."
I have two questions for you.
I want Tom to come to Boston.
The car is very fast.
He went to bed at ten as usual.
My father goes abroad sometimes.
An old man sat surrounded by his grandchildren.
Do you also like jazz?
Tom has known Mary for a long time.
She writes to her son from time to time.
I had no idea you didn't know how to speak French.
Did you record it?
I did that in a couple of days.
Tom told me to give you anything you want.
Strike Tom's name off the list.
It doesn't have any significance.
It's been nice meeting you.
I know what they'll want me to do.
Tom often borrows money from his friends.
He has no equal in the field of electronics.
Tom walked across the field.
Stop by at the grocery store and get these things for me.
I can't recall her name at the moment.
Tom kissed Mary and left.
Tom would've failed without Mary's help.
I fell asleep before the end of the movie.
The ship set sail.
They're inseparable.
Tom has been absent from school for three days.
What would you change?
"I can't do this without you, Tom."
Stir the paint with a stick.
We just landed.
Why did Tom buy a new car?
I didn't know Tom was your boss.
I should start dinner.
The teacher put a short comment on each paper.
Shut up and do what you're told.
French isn't a difficult language.
I'm still mad at Tom.
The lake is very deep.
Go get help.
Tom told Mary to leave.
I will do all I can for you.
It's a very big apple.
I wanted you to know how I felt.
It took us two hours to get to Tokyo by train.
I just wanted to stay with Tom.
Tom's eyes sparkled.
I watch the news every evening.
Tom unzipped his coat.
I didn't even know that you had a horse.
Whose turn is it to wash the dishes?
You have something on your face.
I don't care for him.
Didn't you know Tom and John were brothers?
Please call him.
"You're not giving up, are you?"
Tom was third.
"Unfortunately, I can't accept your invitation."
Don't struggle.
How long should I wait?
How come you didn't do that?
I don't know which way I should go.
My father's hobby is growing roses.
I bathe in the river.
This requires patience.
Take the garbage out.
There are no flowers growing on Mars.
Tom will go to the bank.
I was hoping this would happen.
Which key is it?
We'll have a party.
The password you have entered is invalid.
Politicians don't always tell the truth.
Tom stood right behind Mary.
Tom didn't notice that Mary was smiling.
Tom had nothing to read.
"You want me to tell you it's OK, don't you?"
I can tell you their names.
I was starting to think Tom would sleep all day.
Tom is married to someone else now.
Tom hit it off well with his new boss.
Did Tom actually tell you that?
I'm so glad you came.
The box is empty.
The cabin had no water or electricity.
You have no right to ask me that.
Tom's a volunteer.
Have you ever seen a car accident?
Tom will need these.
Has anyone talked to Tom?
I want to talk to the press.
He put on his glasses and began to read.
What did you do yesterday?
She's not perfect.
Why don't you guys head on home?
Have you received an answer to your letter?
"As I was having lunch, the phone rang."
They say that he is seriously ill.
How long is the flight from Tokyo to Hawaii?
Has the snow melted already?
Who gave it to you?
Tom had one son and two daughters.
I've promised Tom I wouldn't do that anymore.
Something's wrong with the car.
I can't simply give up.
You look much better.
How did Tom ever talk you into this?
I've finished reading the book.
Tom has gone fishing.
How long has he lived there?
I will speak to you tomorrow.
I'm too poor to buy a new suit.
You are blinded by love.
I never expected Tom to cry.
What could go wrong?
I'll send you a postcard.
I've been waiting a long time for you.
It's not me you have to convince.
My car's parked over there.
My home is your home.
Tom ate a quick lunch.
You're quite attractive.
We're almost there.
It looks like we'll get there in time.
Tom pointed at the restaurant across the street.
How can you afford something like this?
Tom and I are awake.
Tom needs to buy a new bicycle.
Why didn't Tom tell Mary about this?
I don't think I should help you.
You look a little pale.
I ate a banana for dessert.
I went fishing again last weekend.
Tom slept more than twelve hours yesterday.
Do you know what time it is in Boston?
It'll never happen again.
Tom doesn't always wear a hat.
I was kidding.
Your feet are dirty.
I'll help you find it.
I'm here to help Tom.
My orders are not up for discussion.
Let's go.
I've never thought about that before.
Put it back where you found it.
"Actually, I feel like talking."
Everybody knows Tom and I don't like each other.
Tom and Mary live on the same street.
I'm glad you didn't get injured.
Tom now understands what's going on.
I'll scold him.
I tried to warn you that Tom was looking for you.
It happens a lot.
I hurt my knee.
Let me try it.
I've spent most of my life in Boston.
Do you understand French?
You could've jeopardized the entire operation.
The accident was due to careless driving.
"If Tom had stayed in his hometown, he never would've met Mary."
I told Tom I didn't intend to do that.
He was almost asleep.
That girl can't ride a bicycle.
I explained to Tom what needed to be done.
I have three computers.
They aren't twins.
I didn't want anything.
It's almost noon.
Which color do you prefer?
What happens when an unstoppable force hits an unmovable object?
You're turning red.
I'm glad you're not dead.
Do you think the situation will change?
Tom means a lot to me.
It's because of you that we were late.
Tell Tom he can't go to Mary's party.
He got lost while he was walking in the woods.
Tom apologized for what he'd done.
Why didn't anyone tell Tom?
That's absolutely right.
"The fog was so dense, we could hardly see anything."
Our teacher likes his new car.
I dreamed that all my teeth fell out.
Where is the nearest internet cafe?
"I don't know when it happened, but it happened."
I think that Tom may be right this time.
Do you want some more cake?
That doesn't prove anything.
I know that I've helped you.
There's no one but me here.
Tom would've never done such a thing.
Tom's French is quite good.
Tom wanted to talk to Mary face to face.
Are you scared?
I've got to go back.
What was that girl doing in your room?
Tom told me why I should study French.
Scientists haven't found a cure for cancer yet.
Tom isn't much to look at.
Everything happened at lightning speed.
You'll soon be able to speak French.
Have you really already found a new job?
Last week I was in Boston with my wife.
Tom and Mary look cute together.
I lost the watch.
I'm not sure that I can contact Tom.
I don't think that anyone really understands me.
I hope that won't happen again.
It was apparent that someone had taken the money by mistake.
I forgot about it.
It's not that simple.
He trained very hard.
Don't treat me like a dog.
I don't want to live in a big city.
Tom doesn't seem to be enjoying the party.
We're leaving early tomorrow morning.
I don't like to run.
He is angry with you.
Tom wasn't shy.
I think your cat is under the bed.
Do you know what your children are doing right now?
I'll only be staying a few days.
I'm sure Tom dreams.
You're the person I've been looking for.
Have you tried negotiating with Tom?
You're a dreamer.
Let's do it this way.
Where do you think I can find Tom?
You're not supposed to know that.
Do you want a drink?
He put the gun to his head.
"Tom, I've got a surprise for you."
Tom painted the wall white.
Get in touch with your agent right away.
It's obvious that Tom and Mary are more than just friends.
"Could I have one more coffee, please?"
Tom slept on the pull-out sofa.
What else do they need?
They went fishing yesterday.
Tom helped me do that.
"You loved them, didn't you?"
Your car is fast.
Do you really think Tom likes Mary?
Tom told me why he couldn't win.
"Squirrels eat seeds and nuts, as well as insects and mushrooms."
Didn't you know that the door was locked?
I think that Tom lives somewhere around here.
Tom is a religious man.
Do you know anyone here?
What does being a good mother mean to you?
You don't need to come here anymore.
I bought it for ten dollars.
Tom looks winded.
I want to eat.
You're not guilty.
I didn't know that you had so many cats.
He can not have gone to school.
What time yesterday was the concert?
Tom is happy when he's with Mary.
We often play cards on Sunday.
It was in this box.
"I don't know about you, but I believe Tom."
The world is not going to be saved by legislation.
I'm glad you could join us.
"I think I'm right, but I'm not going to fight about it."
I need to try.
When will you leave?
I'm sure you're busy.
How did you and Tom first meet?
Did you think I was Canadian?
Why are you so mad?
I believe her story.
His name was becoming widely known.
I hope Tom remembers us.
We have a plan.
Can I try it?
I felt I should apologize.
When was the last time you went to church?
Tom is much taller than you are.
Please tell me this isn't true.
We knew we just couldn't give up.
Solve the problem.
Tom will be thirty in March.
We know we're going to lose.
The heat of the sun hardens clay.
Blood rushed to Tom's face.
Is this a real diamond?
Where did it come from?
Why do we need weapons?
My uncle has been diagnosed with leukemia.
Tom cooked dinner.
"The year before last, we went to Europe."
It's a huge mistake.
I have to write some letters.
Tom and Mary usually speak French together.
Part of his story is true.
"Despite all his setbacks, he remains an optimist."
What year was your car made?
What do you think we can do to help Tom?
The calendar on the refrigerator had Tom's birthday circled.
Tom is just a friend. He's not my boyfriend.
Are we coming back?
I'm focusing on my job.
We solved that problem last week.
Tom is the best drummer that I know.
Tom said that he was homesick.
Didn't you know that that would happen?
Do you think I should ask Tom for help?
Tom was worried about that.
Don't you think that's a bit weird?
I hear you've been promoted.
I'm drinking juice.
Let's eat.
I have to set a good example.
I can't read music.
I told you I'm not hungry.
I saw you in the park yesterday.
We played cards to kill time.
Tom doesn't want to lose you.
Tom knows Mary is rich.
I don't know when I'll be able to get back to Boston.
Tom said you were his friend.
I know that what I did was wrong.
Tom will be a hundred years old next year.
How many hours are left?
Get a ticket for me.
We heard shots in the distance.
Tom walked his dogs every morning.
Tom went back to his room.
We started studying French in elementary school.
Do you think your money is safe in a bank?
Tom cleaned the top of the table with a wet rag.
"You are young. I, on the other hand, am very old."
I suppose you didn't even talk to Tom.
Tom was the first to enter the room.
I can't hate you.
How do you know which one is yours?
Tom has done his part.
It didn't bother me.
Get out of my life!
I'll call back in twenty minutes.
All I had in my pocket was a bus ticket and thirty dollars.
Tom doesn't cook well.
Tom didn't commit those crimes.
How does this remote work?
I'd love to have breakfast with you.
I know the Jacksons.
You said that you loved Tom.
Don't worry. It's perfectly normal.
I thought you were serious.
Hand me that oven mitt.
Can I use your pencil?
Tom believes that Mary was murdered.
Sunday follows Saturday.
I'm best at math.
We're not in school anymore.
Tom needs to be arrested.
I know that Tom helped you.
No one took notice of him.
I don't want to break your heart.
He climbed up the tree like a monkey.
"Tom and Mary walked down the path, holding hands."
Tom had a problem yesterday.
That would be too easy.
Could you give me a lift home?
I don't blame you.
Tom asked me if I knew where Mary lived.
You have to leave now.
Tom can't afford to buy a house.
I know you aren't a doctor.
Tom was asked not to do that again.
I already bought it.
I want to open my own restaurant.
Rollerblading is fun and is also good exercise.
That bridge is made of stone.
Teach us something new.
She went to the hospital by taxi.
Come to the party.
Do you know where Tom and Mary are?
Why is it empty?
Why is this so important to everybody?
Cut off the power.
I don't know why Tom is tired.
They have been married two years.
"When she heard the news, she broke down crying."
Why are you in Boston?

Do no harm to others.

Tell Tom I want to see him first thing in the morning.
Forget about it.

Tell me I did the right thing.
Tell me where to put this.
Why didn't you tell me about that earlier?

Tom must come.
What size do you think I take?
Please ask me before you borrow my clothes.
Tom bought it for Mary.

I'm too tired to walk.
Tom is probably a bit older than Mary.

Tom said he didn't know anything about that.
I have a round trip ticket to Tokyo.

You're too kind.
We'll win.
The day turned out to be fine.
I have a round bald spot on my head.
"Since you're here, you can help me."
Take this chair. It's sturdy.
We don't know if it's a problem or not.
Tom is often absent.
Are we in danger?
It'll take longer to tell you how to do it than to just go ahead and do it myself.
The coffee's on me.
Mary is clearing her throat.
I had to stop.
Tom made one more request.
You can find more information on our website.
I sent Mary flowers on Valentine's Day.

Tom says that he'll do that on Monday.

You don't have to thank me.
Tom never killed anyone.

We were lucky again.
Is Tom coming back?
I heard about what happened.
Let's not talk about school.
I know that you're smart.

Are you afraid of the future?
You're getting better.

Some people are for the plan and others are against it.
She did not go there.
How long has Tom worked with you?
I hope you don't snore.
I can't say that's the result I was hoping for.
I get up around seven.
I've already told Tom I don't want him to do that.
Have you thought about what I said?
When does the magazine come out?
Don't play baseball in the park.
Tom only talks to Mary.
I'm afraid it's going to take a bit more money.

Do I have to do that today?

Please make coffee.
You know I don't believe you.
Didn't you know that I could speak French?
I'll eat it.
It's time for you to go.
Have you ever been stuck in an elevator?
Are you sure that's enough?
Turn to the left.
Tom will never find it.
Tom has been driving without a license.
There's no need to worry about Tom.
What a pleasant surprise!
"I didn't want to go, but I did."
She did it easily.
She goes to school by bus.
What led you to this conclusion?
Tom hasn't left yet.
Can you break a five dollar bill?
Just give it to Tom.

Tom will come back soon.
He'll be able to make it in three hours.
"What's worrying you, Tom?"
Tom will be moving to Boston next week.
I wasn't worried.
What did you do to my computer?
Tom doesn't think it's such a big problem.
We'll deal with them later.
Let me see your tongue.
I didn't ask whether Tom was planning on doing that or not.
Please read the instructions.
I have something I want to tell Tom.
He handled the knife and fork very well.
Will Tom be here soon?
"This is for you, Tom."
It won't help you.
I know Tom is a cook.
I had the flu last month.
We kept together for safety.
I wasn't kidding.
"It was Tom, wasn't it?"
Look what I can do.
I've never seen so many books in one place.
We're moving to Boston next week.
Stop hitting Tom.
I water the flowers in the garden every day.
Tom didn't respond immediately.
Christmas falls on Sunday this year.
I hope Tom and Mary do that.
Why are you asking me about Tom?
I'm coming to pick you up.
Tom had a narrow escape.
Do you know my husband?
That's obscene.
Aren't you going to vote today?
The floor is very cold.
You're acting very strange tonight.
Tom loved you.
Tom isn't old enough to understand this.
Stop crying. You'll ruin your mascara.
I knew Tom wanted to do that.
I know a little French.
Did you read everything?
I'm the only one who understands.
Tom paid for it.
Why didn't you tell Tom this?
Tom can't stand you.
What do you think happened to me?
I don't have time to read.
Did he hit you?
Turn it off.
I worried about Tom's health.
Fold up the map.
You broke my nose.
You never told me about what happened.
Tom told me you're smart.
It's acceptable.
You are going to have to pay for it.
Eat whenever you want.
How about going swimming?
I have a son and a daughter. My son lives in Boston and my daughter lives in Chicago.
I've got to do it.
You may go anywhere you like.
They both died.
I hate insects.
Tom's new wife's name is Mary.
I've just spoken to Tom about that.
I am calling my brother.
Tom took a sip of my drink.
I knew Tom wouldn't be here.
Were they lying?
You said Tom liked me.

Did you take it?
Tom said you were in Boston.
I don't want visitors.
I wasn't dressed appropriately.
He was weak from the loss of blood.
Tom fell off his horse.
Tom doesn't want to die.
Tom and I are going to the mall.
I'm too tired to do anything right now.
I don't have anything.
I'm taking a walk.
Tom gave Mary a gentle push.
Tom has done many stupid things.
She had nothing to say about it.
I wish that you hadn't seen me doing that.
Tom didn't tell me why he wanted to do that.
Tom always speaks in French.
Is this what you want?
I told Tom to go.
I am talking to my sister.
Tom pitied Mary.
I have to go to the station to meet Tom.
Tom will need to wait here.
Have you told Tom about what happened yesterday at school?
Tom asked Mary what she was planning on doing.
Tom left on time.
I completely forgot about her.
She is no longer what she used to be.
I got a B in physics.
I was late for the last bus.
You're free.
You have to stay away from Tom.
Tom attended Mary's funeral.
The toy store is closed.
This place is creepy.
Tom and Mary don't know each other.
I counted up to 200.
Let's be friends.
I didn't go with Tom.
Tom has been telling lies.
I don't see anything remotely suspicious.
You're too young to join the army.
Tom likes to hunt.
I don't think that he's right.
I often receive letters from her.
Thank you for asking.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
Tom will fight.
Let's talk here.
Tom is probably going to wait.
I don't think Tom will want to go with us.
What was Tom's last name?
Tom won't even talk to Mary anymore.
"I don't want to do this, but you leave me no choice."
There is a large lake near our town.
Will it rain tomorrow?
Tom's mother told him not to talk with his mouth full.
You would make a great mother.
You didn't come at four. That's why they went without you.
What did you want?
Tell me which one to choose.
I think you should watch that movie.
Golf isn't my cup of tea.
Tom won't talk about it.
I thank you.
I didn't hire Tom.
"Quiet, please."
The CIA is watching you.
I'm a little tired.
My daughter likes Tom.
I knew Tom was dead.
Say it again.
Haven't you ever done this before?
How many concerts did you go to last year?
He founded the school five years ago.
I did my job.
Did you tell Tom what we talked about?
"Even though Tom eats mostly junk food, he rarely gets sick and his BMI is in the normal range."
Tom calls me every day at about 2:30.
Tom hates Halloween.
I'm shocked you could make such an accusation.
That's not what I meant to say.
"If you knew about this, why didn't you tell us?"
Dinosaurs are animals that disappeared long ago.
Why don't you ever cook?
It looks like you're bored.
Tom kicked the trash can.
Let's rest a little.
Keep warm.
I was probably thirty years old at that time.
I thought you didn't believe in ghosts.
Tom didn't work on October 20th.
Take a deep breath and hold it for as long as you can.
Why did you hide?
I've just come home.
Tom hid in the barn.
I don't recall asking for your opinion.
Have you read the whole paper from beginning to end?
When was the last time you went to Boston?
I'd like to go on another cruise.
I'm very grateful for everything you've done.
Try to be yourself.
I think we can help one another.
I miss Tom already.
Tom doesn't come to school very often.
Can you do that for Tom?
Did Tom make it?
"By the year 2020, the population of our city will have doubled."
There is no smoking allowed on our campus.
Tom says he's hungry.
Why is there sawdust on the floor?
You were probably right.
You have to believe us.
This is exactly what I wanted to see.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I have to change into my work clothes.
I have my own house.
Do you play a musical instrument?
I don't think that Tom is weird.
Smoking stinks.
Tom almost never eats chocolate.
She asked him to call her later.
You don't have to thank me.
I loved you.
I'm impressed with your work.
We'll deal with this later.
I seldom make mistakes.
A rat chewed a hole in the wall.
I can replace it.
I wouldn't be so sure.
I won't breathe a word.
Tom just had a bad day.
Does Tom want something?
You can wait outside.
Tom has already been captured.
What have you done with Tom?
Tom is a miner.
I'm unarmed.
Which one's yours?
What do you plan to do about it?
Please tell us something about yourself.
What other games did you play?
That girl loved climbing trees.
It looks like Tom is waiting for somebody.
I don't want to cause you any trouble.
The sun was shining brightly.
I want to buy a new car.
Who's taking responsibility for this mess?
Tom usually eats a bowl of cereal for breakfast.
I like to talk.
How often do you eat pork?
We forgot.
I don't think you're the right person for the job.
I'll never ever forgive Tom for what he did.
Ignorance is bliss.
I'm hurt bad.
"Unfortunately, it wasn't that easy."
I'm glad Tom isn't here.
Tell me what movies you guys have seen.
I'm not entirely sure.
I hope that you'll come tomorrow.
I didn't order fish.
Do you want the job or not?
This is something to consider.
Tom knows he can trust us.
What's the name of your ship?
"Join us, won't you?"
"I understand what you mean, but I'm not sure how to translate it."
How did you find out where I live?
She is a little shy.
When do you use it?
The children made a giant snowman.
Tom stayed at home with his family.
Tom is quite thin.
"If it rains tomorrow, they will not go."
I would like to see it.
There is a hole in your sock.
Are local trains included on this schedule?
"If I get the opportunity again, I'll definitely do that."
I don't know what to talk about.
I am tired because I had to study for this exam last night.
We've got to help Tom.
"Tom hangs his clothes, then arranges them by color."
We study French.
I'm doing great.
I'm glad I invited you.
My parents died when I was three.
Don't try to trick us.
There is no use waiting for her any longer.
You're so right.
Tom is very hard to get along with.
Don't you know me?
Everyone in the room was stunned by what happened.
Are you sure you don't want to study at my house?
Tom is a very creative person.
Your idea is similar to mine.
Maybe I should have spoken with Tom.
He bought a bottle of cheap wine.
I see no reason to continue this discussion.
Does it matter to you if I'm a little late?
Thanks for your support.
You're not even listening.
Tom told me to stay quiet.
I hope someone will do that.
Tom tried to stop Mary.
Tom doesn't like clubs.
We should've stayed with Tom.
I shouldn't be talking to you.
Tom is about the same height as Mary.
Are you working today?
I'm sure Tom doesn't think that.
What were you telling Tom?
He often gets sick.
You're supposed to be relaxing.
We need to finish what we've started.
Did anyone tell Tom?
When was this wall built?
Tom's very nice.
Not all girls are like that.
Can you spell it?
The construction of the building will be started next year.
Wait in the lobby.
She hit him again and again.
Leaves begin to fall in October.
Tom isn't a superstar.
Tom may stay.
Today I have a good appetite.
Tom is currently on vacation.
"Wait in line, please."
I didn't get fired.
Would you eat this?
Tom went home on foot.
I don't want Tom to get upset.
You are a good student.
I know that Tom wants to become a pediatrician.
Tom is very worried.
I hope Tom is easy to get along with.
Tom isn't accustomed to city life.
Never confuse pity with love.
You're not supposed to be here.
I'll support you.
I have nothing more to add.
That's what I was going to say.
Let's go back to Boston.
I was impressed with Tom.
It was obviously a mistake.
Find Tom before he tells someone.
I have many talents.
Tom says he doesn't know when Mary was born.
Tom raised his rifle and pointed it at Mary.
They all listened.
Please continue.
This is the book that Tom was talking about yesterday.
I'm not as stupid as you think I am.
Tom isn't always at home on Sundays.
What do you love? What don't you love?
Will you stay here for a while?
Just keep trying.
Tom is a typical workaholic.
I wish that I hadn't hit Tom.
"By the way, have you seen him lately?"
How do you know Tom did it?
I knew that Tom wouldn't be able to help us.
Was that too easy?
He bought a bicycle for fifty thousand yen.
He came from Tokyo yesterday.
I know you're there.
I hadn't expected anyone to be home.
I've already found a volunteer.
Don't touch that. It's evidence.
Doctors were afraid to remove the bullet.
The meeting began at nine o'clock sharp.
I think I'm pregnant.
Tom may decide not to do that.
Tom will take care of everything for us.
He went to the airport to see her off.
I think you'll win.
It's a sure thing.
Somebody's following me.
There's nothing Tom can do to help Mary.
Tom looked at the picture and smiled.
He looks confused.
My aunt gave me a photo album.
"You must kneel at my feet, kiss my hand and swear that I am an angel."
I'm not advocating that.
The killer's identity is still unknown.
He worked last night without taking a break.
I saw Tom do it.
Is his father alive?
I'm not going to marry you.
I know it was you.
I've always played with my brother.
The sun sank below the horizon and it got dark.
I really don't know what you're talking about.
I told you I don't know anything.
What did you cook for dinner?
Do you need to leave today?
Learn from your mistakes.
"If that happens, let me know."
I don't want to hear your excuses.
Tom is a trainee.
Tom claims he's never done that.
Here's the magazine you were looking for.
I asked her for her address.
What did you both do?
"Up to now, we've never had this problem."
It didn't help.
You beat me fair and square.
I haven't bought anything recently.
I'd rather stay here.
They're better than we are.
I know the problem.
I didn't realize you were already here.
They called off their visit to London.
I thought I heard a gunshot.
One of those girls is my sister.
I didn't come here to talk about my problems.
Tom is devious.
Tom plucked the chicken.
I can't live this way anymore.
He made a bet with her.
How's that again?
I ate a large pizza with a friend an hour ago.
Tom asked Mary what she was looking for.
Nothing else matters.
I ate a little too much yesterday.
I could hardly hear what Tom was saying.
I want to tell you something.
I don't think that Tom was hiding.
Why hasn't anyone said anything?
I might've done the same thing.
Tom said he didn't want anything.
He was about to start.
The atomic energy is expensive and dangerous.
I think a lot of people would agree with me.
We miss Tom.
Theory and practice do not necessarily go together.
I hope Tom laughed at your jokes.
This will be an interesting challenge.
Tom came to Boston when he was thirteen years old.
We smiled.
I can't tell you everything.
Dinner's ready!
She takes private piano lessons.
Can I borrow $30?
We want out of here.
Tom's car has been stolen.
Help me.
This vacuum cleaner makes a lot of noise.
Can I do that tomorrow?
The police stationed a man at the door.
I didn't even know that you had one.
Just tell me where Tom is.
The light has turned green.
She folded her handkerchief neatly.
I think it's time to get out of here.
You have to pay in advance.
I wanted to remember.
Tom closes his eyes when he swims underwater.
Don't be so outraged.
Thank you for listening.
Is that against the law?
Why aren't Tom and Mary here?
Bring a camera.
Tom always forgets Mary's birthday.
I ran out of time.
The white umbrella is yours.
It's going to get dark soon.
She's an outspoken person.
I'm free this evening.
You've got to tell Tom what happened.
Tom thought you were drunk.
There's another way out.
Are you sure that's a good idea?
I promise you I'll stay with you until your father arrives.
We don't talk a lot.
It belonged to my mother.
Do we have enough food for everyone?
A bunch of people were standing outside waiting.
What's this hotel's fax number?
Tom sent me a Christmas gift.
Today is a warm day.
The party's tomorrow.
I was the only adult other than the driver on the bus.
You're my son.
I'll obey.
Which of you will try it first?
We have very high standards.
Tom was like a brother to Mary.
I'll try harder.
Are you sure that Tom wants to do that?
Are you 18?
Tom loves to fish.
Tom said that he knew you.
Cut it out.
Tom told me not to tell Mary about what happened.
Tom didn't give Mary a choice.
How dare you say that to me!
The entire family is shocked.
I don't eat a lot of fruit.
I didn't know you were a surgeon.
You said that you needed more time.
Give us three minutes.
I believed that he was a physician.
Tom knows more.
Is there anything you can do for Tom?
"Some are expensive, and others are very cheap."
I don't remember him saying that.
Please help yourself to the cake.
I think you've been punished enough.
I shouldn't be talking to you.
You are entitled to your opinion.
Tom took his time.
That's a question I can't answer.
"Your name is Tom, isn't it?"
Tom didn't tell me that he didn't have a driver's license.
"When did he die? ""Not very long ago."""
Tom doesn't want you to share this information with anyone.
Tom made a lowball offer.
It is dangerous to drive so fast.
"We were close, Tom and I."
How was the math test?
It's a strange one.
I don't know how much time we have left.
I got a job.
There is nothing like cold beer on a hot day.
Do you want to go someplace?
Tom has a black eye.
Why is this necessary?
Tom isn't Mary's uncle.
I can't stand this pain any more.
We've got plenty of money.
Tom will help me.
I'm not lonely anymore.
What'll happen if I push this button?
What color clothes do you usually wear?
Somebody set the fire.
We're both men.
I knew Tom would do what we asked.
Tom didn't have to apologize to me.
How is your grandmother?
Have you ever been in a long distance relationship?
Guess where I'm calling from.
Is this the train for London?
Tom admires your courage.
Can you tell me anything else about that?
I don't think it's safe to swim here.
I have to give it to Tom.
That's just what the doctor ordered.
The national debt is growing.
Tom wants to escape.
I'm thinking about moving to Australia.
The Chinese are a friendly people.
Tell me everything you know about this.
I just didn't know what to do.
"Look at the blackboard, everyone."
I don't know who she is.
The boy eats bread.
It was a disaster.
The data is incorrect.
Do you really care what they think?
Please come to my house tomorrow.
I'd rather skip school and play video games.
Will you go with Tom?
I'll write or phone you next week.
When did Tom find out?
Bring a warm sweater.
He knows who I am.
I've missed you so much.
There's something coming.
I'll tell you what I know about that.
Tom died in Mary's arms.
Don't call Tom at home after 2:30.
I'm swamped with work.
I'm learning so much from you.
How much time do we have to finish this?
The car is blue.
Tom complimented Mary.
I told Tom that I would help him.
No one was helping us.
I know how to take care of myself.
I didn't see it.
The sky is blue.
Do you know where it is?
"When I grow up, I want to be a king."
He left for America the day before yesterday.
I don't know if I still have it.
Tom isn't very fat.
I've already taken out the garbage.
This is a picture of Tom's wife.
Tom's dog has run away.
The concert's been canceled.
The police want to talk to you.
Possibly it wasn't Tom who did that.
It happened three hours ago.
Tom wasn't able to go to Australia.
Tom was lying.
A burglar broke into the shop last night.
Put your coat back on.
Do you trust Tom yet?
This is what I wanted.
My watch has stopped.
"When asked how to do it, he said he didn't know."
I can explain this in detail if you want me to.
See you at Christmas.
You can't change the past.
The murder weapon was never found.
It looks like you're skeptical.
That sounds amazing.
Tom said that he quit his job.
He seemed sure of himself.
Tom said he didn't have a dog.
I wish I had your job.
It would be better for you to read more books.
I spent hours reading books.
I don't think that Tom knows what Mary is looking for.
Did you know Tom very well?
These chairs are not comfortable.
Are you sure his name was Tom?
I have no idea how Tom must feel.
I thought you enjoyed swimming.
I ran downstairs.
I'll go to the beach.
Tom and Mary live in this neighborhood.
How many goats do they have?
We work together.
I'll buy it.
We left at 2:30.
I called a taxi for Tom.
I'm sure Tom will be here by 2:30.
Why didn't you want to go to Boston?
Tom doesn't know anything about us.
I'd really like to help.
You drank from my cup.
You're three years older than me.
Did you get the flowers that I sent you?
"Go home to your wife, Tom."
I recognized Tom.
You're dying.
Tom slept in the barn.
Tom wasn't told not to do that.
You were wrong.
Tom is the only one who knows Mary's phone number.
He expressed himself clearly.
I think you're drinking out of my glass.
"The more one has, the more one wants."
Tom is not likely to win.
Here is the hospital where I was born.
This is not at all surprising.
I have a rash on my hand.
What does Tom mean by that?
Did Tom tell you where to park?
I'm not done with you.
I have fewer books than you.
Tom has school tomorrow.
Tom knows how to play the piano.
This is the best.
Did you enjoy the concert?
Go stand over there and wait for me.
Think about tomorrow.
I'm not the one who told Tom to leave.
He will have to go there.
Is your blood pressure high?
How do you say this word?
A fork fell off the table.
Tom is an optimist.
I wasn't ready.
There's a spot on your shirt.
He keeps his age a secret.
Are you mad at Tom?
I just want you to listen to me.
"Which is more important, me or your job?"
We'll certainly invite Tom.
Did Tom say how long he'd be in Boston?
Why are you telling us this?
Can you understand?
Tom handed his cellphone to Mary.
Tom can't be here.
I hate women who say that all men are the same.
I'm in the cellar.
"Can you hold the elevator, please?"
I don't know if I should tell Tom.
Why's it so hot in here?
What do these dots represent on the map?
When did it start snowing?
I couldn't stop myself from laughing.
Were you looking for Tom?
I'm really fast.
I don't think I've broken any rules.
Do I owe you something?
Are you eating right?
Tom lives in a safe place.
I have work that must be done.
I shouldn't have gone to Boston without you.
You know better.
Do you need any more help?
Call me this evening.
He doesn't know much about Japan.
Drop by my office this evening.
I'd rather discuss this later.
She became a great artist.
I don't care what you want.
Tom was really drunk last night.
"I did that, even though I didn't need to."
I wasn't the one who broke the window.
She may not come.
I don't know Tom's address.
He asked me to open the door.
Look at that mountain.
I have no reason to lie to you.
There was an uneasy silence.
We just want you to tell the truth.
Tom owes Mary three hundred dollars.
I see you are awake.
I don't think that Tom knows Mary can speak French.
Keep your promises.
You should write Tom a letter.
Tom is afraid of getting lung cancer.
What's come over you?
Can I have it back?
You had a long day.
Tom sliced the tomatoes.
I told Tom you'd come to Boston.
Do you have a generator?
What do you say to dining out tonight?
Say hello.
You could have told me.
Please write the answer on this piece of paper.
Didn't you know Tom?
I don't know who did it.
I thought it was delicious.
We all have secrets.
You told me that you were busy.
I can't believe it's true.
I hope you don't get lost.
I've always been proud of you.
I knew you'd say something like that.
I was quoting Tom.
Tom is in luck.
Spanish is spoken in many countries.
Who's missing?
Dancing is prohibited.
Tom and I don't speak to each other.
Tom made a big donation to the hospital.
I hope I get a chance to visit Boston.
I feel protected.
Tom got nervous.
I wanted Tom to help me clean the living room.
There remains nothing to be desired.
This one's empty.
That job paid well.
Can I ask you a delicate question?
They sent us the results.
I've already waited for three hours.
Tom is rarely late for appointments.
I know you don't do that.
I think something bad will happen.
I went downstairs to get some milk and cookies.
I bought Tom a tricycle.
I hear you just got married.
We have a lot of them.
Tom found the door locked.
How old were you when you stopped believing in Santa Claus?
I've never heard this song before.
Tom wants to become an electrician.
She climbed down from the roof.
I wasn't informed.
I'm not just going to give it to you.
Tom doesn't have the skill to win.
I know that Tom is guilty.
Do you want to give up?
I don't think Tom will cry.
Tom will be very proud of you.
Can I go to the movies tomorrow?
You make it sound so easy.
"Tom wasn't there, was he?"
Tom is still in shock.
There were no other survivors.
You should sleep.
Tom graduated from college in 2003.
I want what you want.
The men loaded the baggage into the truck.
Don't make me wait.
All the boys enjoyed skiing.
I'm retiring.
It looks like snow.
I don't think Tom knows where Mary is now.
It's almost time to go.
I don't want Tom to leave.
I don't know why you want me to do that.
I know how I can do it.
Clocks measure time.
Tom is almost always right.
Is your watch correct?
I need this space.
Tom wanted to eat spaghetti.
She smiled at her baby.
Why are cooks fat?
I don't think Tom does that.
We have branches everywhere.
I'm glad to hear you're better.
Only Tom can do that.
I'm ready to work.
Tom didn't do everything he needed to do.
Tom is on his way in.
Yesterday I met Mary on the street.
This must've belonged to Tom.
Did you draw that?
Tom wants to go for a walk.
Do you consider them dangerous?
We've stopped doing that.
"You know her name, don't you?"
May I talk to you now?
You won't like what I'm going to say.
I am writing to you on behalf of my mother.
Police suspect that the kidnappers could be armed.
Tom asks us the same questions all the time.
Someone unlocked the door.
I'm here every day.
Do you live near Tom?
He arrived after I had left.
I'm quite sure.
Tom is too scared to talk about it.
Do you want to watch the baseball game on TV?
Everybody's a suspect.
I didn't know that you were here.
I don't know much about sports.
Tom continued speaking.
I'm going to miss you so much.
I didn't know that you were upset.
Tom died in a traffic accident.
You haven't even tried.
I want Tom to go get me something to eat.
I missed the 7:00 train.
Mary reached for her purse.
The bridge is closed.
Tom wasn't a hero.
Tom thought that we could win.
Let's speak French.
I'm sorry if I offended you.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Do you think Tom would like me to show him how to do that?
Tom didn't mean that.
"Just be careful, Tom."
Are you sure you don't want to wait till tomorrow?
What color do you like?
I joined the football team.
That's not for you.
We lost a lot of time.
We'll all go to Boston next weekend.
Why are you doing this to me?
I need Tom's help.
I understand why you're upset.
Tom walks three miles a day.
Be patient.
They were very happy.
They're armed with knives.
I prefer red wine to white.
I have a train to catch.
Don't fritter away your allowance.
Do you have any apples?
"Speak more slowly, please."
Tom injured his knee.
Two pints are equal to a quart.
That was last week.
"Tom can say ""I can only speak French"" in thirty languages."
Who are you to judge?
Tom became agitated.
You're our neighbor.
You look afraid.
Do you need more time to finish that?
Give Tom a minute.
Did Tom say where he went last weekend?
Tom introduced Mary to his daughter.
Are you still up?
He helped me to get over the difficulties.
Not all men are like that.
Nobody believes what I say.
Tom looks like he's pleased.
The sun went behind the clouds.
It's the end.
Let me stay with you.
I'd like to find out how Tom is getting along with his new boss.
Did you know that your oven doesn't work?
Tom is sitting by the campfire.
Tom didn't want my help.
It might be expensive.
Innocence is a beautiful thing.
Tom handed Mary a pen.
"You didn't know that I couldn't do that, did you?"
He did the work to the best of his ability.
I don't know what I'm going to do tomorrow.
We're overworked.
That cheese is made from sheep's milk.
I don't know where they're from.
I promise I'll do it.
I'm afraid we won't be able to help you tomorrow.
She is proud of her father being rich.
Tom said that he liked it a lot.
Tom wasn't there that night.
Do something.
"Which do you prefer, dogs or cats?"
What have you come to talk about?
You look tired. You should rest a little.
You can go if you want.
I thought that I told you about that yesterday.
I'll catch the next train.
Did you really think I wouldn't help you?
I saw him crossing the road.
She fell in love with her friend's brother.
Tom doesn't usually do this kind of thing.
She was wearing a strange hat.
She needs this.
All Tom needed was money.
They haven't won yet.
Where are Tom's keys?
I believe I can trust you.
You must not smoke while working.
Tom has two girlfriends.
Tom can come with you if he wants to.
Did you wash that?
Tom is used to doing that.
I don't know when the prices will change.
Tom felt helpless.
Tom is now studying in his room.
It is neither good nor bad.
"Are you there, Tom?"
I thought of you immediately.
Who did you hear this news from?
Tom didn't have to go back to Boston.
It's that important.
I don't like you very much.
He zipped open his bag.
Don't get killed.
Tom likes lacrosse.
I'll help you if you help me.
I have a backache.
How do I know you didn't do it?
Did anybody see what happened?
I will inform Tom.
Do you know us?
We'll continue later.
Tom will definitely help me.
What's Tom doing?
She went to the airport to see him off.
You need to shave.
Don't expect Tom to do that.
Tom doesn't know exactly when Mary will get home.
You know where the problem lies.
That's my favorite expression.
That displeased everyone.
My parents won't mind.
I knew you'd cry.
Mary said that she had nothing to wear.
Do you think Tom is going to agree to this?
I've written three letters.
Don't call me at work.
I don't know how to explain that.
"Thanks for the help, guys."
Tom looks worried.
I had a dog for thirteen years.
Do you want it now?
Tom is going to be ready.
We have different needs.
Let's try again.
He doesn't love his girlfriend.
I don't know whether Tom can do that or not.
I wish I wasn't such an idiot.
I'm feeling good this morning.
You know I can't wait any more.
You seem very nervous this morning.
Tom told me what was happening there.
Can you leave the light on?
We have yellow apples.
Everyone was looking at you.
I'll explain the situation to Tom.
I'd like to live in Boston.
Tom knows that I don't care.
Her questions indicate that she understands the subject very well.
I know Tom was offended.
"The last time we met, Tom called me a liar."
Tom seems to be unwilling to be a suicide bomber.
I asked Tom where he got that.
Tom didn't want to help.
How did Tom know that Mary would be here?
What are you two doing?
Do you think he made that mistake on purpose?
Tom is digging a hole.
I returned home from Boston yesterday.
This history book is written for high school students.
I'd like to help you if I can.
Both of them are kind and honest.
Tom Jackson was elected mayor.
Tom saw Mary and John kissing.
You don't want Tom to think you're insane.
It needs washing.
My father says he's planning to buy me a horse.
You have taught him well.
My eyes watered.
Things aren't easy.
I do things in my own way.
He got all he wanted.
Find out what they're doing here.
I'm kind of hungry.
Do you have a better idea?
That's what Tom does to those he doesn't like.
I don't like doing this.
Roses smell nice.
I think everybody's hungry.
Sometimes my sister makes supper.
She and I are in the same class.
I want to tell Tom.
Where exactly are we going?
It was easy to find Tom's office.
Tom should know this.
Do you have a light beer?
You will be there again soon.
Tom is younger than you think.
Tom says you're a genius.
Tom thought about what he'd do when he got out of prison.
I'll try to be quick.
How's that your fault?
Why didn't you tell me all this before?
I'm tone-deaf.
Tom zoomed in.
What's in the boxes?
What can't you do?
Don't give me that.
I'm sorry I asked.
"I can read English, but I can't speak it."
"We'll have a picnic tomorrow, weather permitting, of course."
It's your duty to vote.
They laughed again.
I thought you'd seen this movie.
I almost fell into the pool.
"You speak French very well, indeed."
We are in part responsible for it.
I need his help.
Don't think I didn't try.
Is this the car Tom told us about?
A strange car was parked in front of my house.
The American troops held their ground.
The investigation is continuing.
What do we owe?
They said no.
You deserved it.
The students learned this poem by heart.
I had to hide.
I need to know what you know.
They lost again.
Are you listening to me at all?
I made Tom laugh.
Stay out of the water.
I studied French.
Were Tom and Mary friends?
"Fortunately, today Tom is much better than he was yesterday."
The project to build a new sports center has fallen through for lack of adequate funds.
Do you really expect Tom to win?
You did your part.
Tom didn't convince everyone.
I remember giving Tom the key.
Tom knows a lot about Mary.
I'll make you some tea.
I'm a stranger here.
Tom knows why Mary cried.
Do you have lots of friends?
Tom has had his say.
I want to know when Tom will be back.
Tom has a moustache.
I exaggerated.
We could've helped Tom.
I'm not allowed to talk to you.
I know Tom's brother.
She lived to be ninety.
Neither Tom nor Mary has anything to apologize for.
How many kids does Tom have?
He tasted the cheesecake.
We want to win.
Don't waste my time.
Why do you say that?
We don't need any more chairs.
I knew that Tom would get into trouble.
I added his name to the list.
Please call me before you come.
There is a doll in the box.
Tom hurried off.
The sum of all the angles in a triangle equals 180 degrees.
Go wash your hands.
His brother went to the station to see him off.
She cooks very well.
I really like your work.
Tom needs to be told not to do that again.
Don't you want to know how Tom did that?
"I'm sorry, this isn't for sale."
I remember it vividly.
Members of that tribe settled along the river.
I don't think I can do that tonight.
We must protect the environment.
I want to change my clothes.
I'm afraid Tom had to leave.
He taught his son how to swim.
I didn't know that Tom was Mary's grandson.
I'm not ashamed.
Can I speak to Tom?
I never liked that one anyway.
Let's take a train.
Who broke this?
I made you lunch.
Can you settle this?
You'll never guess where I've been all morning.
Why do you need matches?
Tom took care of Mary.
Tom is much shorter than you.
Tom and Mary must really like each other.
Tom will do the same thing for me.
Tom never talks about his childhood.
Tom told us to leave.
They trust you.
You may leave your bag here.
The time has come to tell Tom the truth.
Tom slowly closed his eyes.
We'll survive this.
Tom told me you'd say that.
That can't last.
I didn't pass the exam.
He delivered a very long speech yesterday.
Tell Tom I'm hungry.
Can you tell me about your project?
I went on foot.
You both seem afraid.
Why do you always avoid that topic?
Can you find it?
Many people are on vacation.
Do it the way I told you to.
Tom said that Mary wouldn't win.
What do you need the money for?
I didn't know what to do.
Tom told me that he liked working with Mary.
It's so cold here. You'd think we were at the North Pole.
Words cannot describe the horror I experienced.
I'm sure that Tom is happy.
Tom set the bird free.
Tom will be glad to see you.
You're splitting hairs.
I know that you don't like me.
Tom has rabbits.
I knew that I was going to be punished.
I was concerned.
"Do you know Tom, by any chance?"
I think Tom may be right this time.
Tom needs to remain in bed.
I nearly had a heart attack.
Do you still play golf?
"If Tom goes, I won't."
You're qualified.
We don't have that.
I don't need to know this.
Tom hasn't been paying attention.
My band's playing tonight.
I'll come back Monday.
You'd be amazed how often I've seen Tom and Mary hanging out together.
Drink it down.
This happened before.
You've underestimated Tom.
"This room is very small, so it is impossible to put more furniture in it."
I want to work with you.
"Tom doesn't care, but Mary does."
I'd like to think I'm a good father.
You're a life saver.
Tom threw a snowball at Mary.
Tom says that Mary didn't win.
Does your brother pick on you a lot?
Do you know what you're going to do?
Don't stop now.
Tom died from pneumonia.
You know that I love all three of you.
"If you don't mind, I'd like to say a few words."
"The shopwoman showed me a lot of neckties, but I didn't like any of them."
Stop pretending you don't know me.
I'm learning French.
All these books will be worth their weight in gold someday.
What's the first question that comes to your mind?
Did you know your oven doesn't work?
Do you hate me?
Are you extroverted?
I think that you paid too much for that.
I'll grab your bags.
I didn't want to believe it.
I should be in Boston before noon tomorrow.
Tom has a broken leg.
"Englishmen are, on the whole, conservative."
Tom looked a bit sheepish.
The teacher opened the box and took out a ball.
I wasn't lonely.
Tom said that you were very beautiful.
I cried all night.
Keep Tom guessing.
Your telephone's ringing.
All of my grandparents are still living.
Tom dropped his pencil.
Conciseness is a virtue.
How long will the meeting last?
Can you imagine what our life would be like without electricity?
How many cups of tea do you drink a day?
He is not a doctor.
I don't know when she got married.
How are you going to prove that?
Isn't Mary beautiful?
Tom really wants to go.
No one is asking you.
Tom and Mary aren't dating.
You see what I mean?
How did you get caught?
We must devise some means of escape.
Tom asked Mary to walk faster.
They may not know anything about this.
Who is this boy?
Have a pleasant journey.
Tom is only thirteen years old.
They are both colleagues of mine.
Tom will be furious.
You could do that if you really wanted to.
Tom told Mary that I was afraid to do that.
Tom bought a gift for Mary.
I will show you around the city.
Where are the children?
"If you wish to leave, you may leave."
Tom admitted that he had made a mistake and apologized.
We're lucky it's not Monday.
That guitar is too expensive for me to buy.
We don't want anything from you.
You don't seem to trust me.
Tom asked Mary who she was.
Are there any beautiful parks in Japan?
I was able to help.
Do you know much about Boston?
His words hurt her feelings.
Why are you under the table?
You must study much harder.
I wish Tom hadn't lied to the police.
Why don't you want to wear a tie?
I'm sure Tom will sober up by morning.
I think I know you.
I will see him after I get back.
Can you tell me when Tom'll be back?
"I'm not married, but my sister is."
We've bought our tickets already.
I'll be there waiting for you.
You should win.
Even smart people sometimes do stupid things.
I told my parents everything.
Everyone's shocked.
Did you see what I did?
He has to repair the clock.
Do you know what Tom is going to do next year?
I don't think I agree with you.
Don't tell anyone we've done this.
It's been raining since Monday.
Are you asking me for help?
Let's just sit here and wait for Tom.
Maybe Tom will go with us.
Tom told me he knows Mary.
The brake's not working.
I could rip you apart with my bare hands.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Tell Tom that I don't need his help.
Tom told me he liked doing that.
You should go in the opposite direction.
I don't want Tom in my house.
"We're on the same team, right?"
Maybe I need a new assistant.
I spoke to him yesterday.
I've worked with Tom before.
Tom didn't say Mary was hungry.
He employs a maid.
We aren't doing anything wrong.
Do you understand or not?
Your story doesn't square with the facts.
I wasn't alone.
I sat next to a woman from Boston.
We must try to determine the best course of action.
There's many a true word spoken in jest.
I'm not even sure if this is my key.
Where will you be in October?
"You have no idea who I am, do you?"
We've already discussed that.
I don't speak French as well as I'd like.
I ignored him.
Are you ready to go?
Tom wasn't very kind.
That was a sign.
The door is unlocked.
He does not live in Sendai.
We should be in a position to help you.
Everyone seems tense.
This is how it has always been.
Can we call Tom now?
How did you manage to escape?
What's your favorite color?
Tom offered Mary a glass of champagne.
"Excuse me, I have a request."
Tom showed Mary a photograph of his father.
Tom didn't buy what he needed to buy.
I live an hour away from work.
I think this is ridiculous.
The boy kept standing for a while.
I was in shock.
We finally have everything we need.
Don't you think that's a bit odd?
When did I give you that?
I don't watch TV.
I know both of them.
Tom is having lunch with the police chief.
I only wanted to protect you.
Don't you want to know?
She shouldn't go out by herself at night.
Does it make sense to fix this?
Everyone's been talking about it.
Someone has died.
Tom can swim.
You know that I don't have a car.
Tom bought me a dictionary.
Nature plays an important role in our life.
I think Tom is hurt.
You punch like a girl.
I am not frightened of anything.
Tell Tom I don't know Mary.
We need to buy a new TV.
Tom says he'll call you later.
I didn't know Tom was your son.
Tom doesn't want to go anywhere.
Show it to him.
I know both Mary and her husband.
I heard a wolf howling.
Tom refused to pay the ransom.
We've all got to start somewhere.
Will you please explain the meaning of this sentence to me?
I don't know why Tom didn't want to go to Australia with me.
We don't need to be here.
Were you born in Boston?
He kicked it.
Can't you read?
Are you sure you're ready for this?
Tom is a really good lawyer.
They sat up all night.
Whose child are you?
Cats can see in the dark.
Tom and Mary are studying together in the library.
I'm the one who painted this picture.
Maybe that's the secret.
Three Canadians were killed.
I knew that Tom had lied to us.
We only want to help you.
This problem isn't going to go away.
I'm sorry Tom wasn't able to come.
I hope you're hungry.
It's quite urgent.
Tom was a sailor.
It is impossible for me to do the work in a week.
This is a ring my grandmother wore.
You're rude.
How did you come up with this crazy idea?
Tom is a singer.
I agreed to do it.
I feel so lost.
What time do you want to leave?
I can't wait because I'm in a hurry.
Did you watch TV tonight?
Tom has gone somewhere.
We simply have no choice.
I still love Mary.
They have their own troubles.
Who am I to tell Tom what to do?
How much time and money would we save?
Tom wants to go out with Mary.
Tom is in very good shape.
Tom wanted to eat some ice cream.
Tom stood in the middle of the room.
Tom is much more experienced than I am.
She wouldn't harm a fly.
He kept it secret that he had bought a bicycle for his son.
I'm waiting for him.
Why can't I hug Tom?
The flood ruined the crops.
Tom isn't doing that for the money.
"Tom tried to say something, but couldn't."
"Tom and I are both married, but not to each other."
I wore the white dress.
Why didn't you tell me that Tom had a daughter?
Show Tom the picture.
Tom has been found.
Why are you out of breath?
You could do this.
I'd say you're jealous.
I can't live this way anymore.
Tom was very cold.
This happened in October.
I still have things to do.
Are you alone right now?
I'm glad you're not a coward like Tom.
Tom put a bunch of keys on the table.
You look tired. You should rest a little.
What's asphalt made of?
We've already talked about that.
I want to stretch my legs.
Tom is really weird.
You must go on a diet because you are too fat.
Tom says he will never go there again.
"That skirt's too short, isn't it?"
I'm easily influenced.
Tom is still having doubts.
Do you want me to explain it again?
We heard voices.
Put it right there.
Tom cut himself with his knife yesterday.
I have a poor appetite.
Buy a book and read it.
I see you are awake.
It has become noticeably colder.
Tom doesn't know you were helping me.
It was a beautiful day.
You can come in here.
Tom could've killed somebody.
I'm not doing this for money.
Tom would like to thank Mary for her help.
Do you know what Tom does?
I hope Tom comes as well.
How long were you in Boston?
Tom drank three cocktails.
Leave it.
My shirt is wet.
I know Tom is a journalist.
Be patient.
I'll introduce you.
I have no money today.
The movie was really scary.
I plan to have lunch with him.
Tell me whose hat this is.
I've already talked to Tom about that matter.
Do you eat rice in your country?
When do you expect the next train?
He promised me to come early.
Don't fail to write to me.
Tom cut himself.
What's the yen-dollar rate today?
Tom didn't do what he was asked.
I think I don't understand you.
Tom talked about music.
You didn't invite me.
Tom and Mary named their son John.
I don't care who does this.
Tom doesn't have a family.
I wish you luck.
We're being hunted.
What Tom has told you is true.
Don't stop here.
I don't have anything to worry about.
Could you make a copy of this for Tom?
We have to cross the street.
I think I shouldn't make a decision without consulting Tom.
Is this your bag?
Tom didn't shoot anyone.
I take a lot of pictures.
You mean you didn't see the fight?
Did you call the plumber?
I was very polite.
I suspected Tom might not have enough money.
I recognized Tom as soon as he walked into the room.
Tom has written another book.
I can't save you this time.
Come home at six.
Tom doesn't talk to anyone.
You're highly intelligent.
Tom will explain it to me.
What Tom saw changed his life.
Tom took off his clothes.
Tom told me that he'd do that.
I broke it.
I would prefer to speak to you in private.
What did that cost?
We're no longer living in the stone age.
Did you notice Tom leaving?
This is the place where she works as a secretary.
Do you like rap?
He is an utter stranger to me.
"You're right, Tom."
Would I lie to you?
Didn't you know Tom had a swimming pool?
Stay at home.
I should've warned you earlier.
Tom killed himself.
I don't like being questioned.
Where did you hide?
I've never seen you like this.
Tom began to sing.
It doesn't happen much anymore.
It's best not to mention that.
Tom boiled the eggs.
Mother told me to behave myself.
It's so pretty.
I can never get Tom on the phone.
Don't you think I'm attractive?
I wish I hadn't had to do that by myself.
Would you mind if I left a little early?
Tom likes trying out new things.
I miss my friends.
I'm hesitant.
Tom died in 2013 of cancer.
I know both Tom and Mary.
I'd stay away from Tom if I were you.
Our school is a ten-minute walk from here.
I have no idea how many people will be at the picnic.
Tom isn't going to force you to do that.
He has quite a few valuable paintings.
Tom taught me how to do this.
Will you be home this evening?
What time are you coming?
We measured the depth of the river.
Tom was afraid of getting caught.
He continued singing.
I'll go with you if necessary.
"I feel very sorry for Tom, poor fellow."
Tom spoke to the doctors in French.
I'll be eternally grateful if you do that.
I've not started yet.
I know why you gave Tom so much money.
Don't jump to conclusions.
Cattle feed on grass.
How lucky you are!
Stop running.
My hobby is writing stories.
There was a big earthquake last night.
Tom is concerned about your safety.
I hope I'm not boring you.
Their daughter is a nurse.
Nobody voted against it.
I know that this is important.
I didn't know you didn't understand French.
They're still in Boston.
Please iron this.
A fuse has blown.
You must have forgotten them at the office.
I thought it was mine.
Tom is sitting between Mary and John.
I just don't want to have people thinking I'm weak.
Tom is better at cooking than I am.
Don't blame yourself for what happened to Tom.
What did you take a picture of?
Senator Kerry was considered a liberal.
I don't know what happened to you.
That computer has a quad-core processor.
I am meeting him next Friday.
I knew that I shouldn't do that.
Do you want to trade places with me?
Tom didn't need to explain it to me.
I'm pretty sure Tom's serious.
That's Tom.
Tom has lost interest in watching TV.
Tom ran down the stairs and hugged Mary.
He is a very important person.
Are you sleepy?
The guitar player is my brother.
The buildings were damaged by the storm last night.
That's why I liked Tom.
I hear Tom doesn't eat meat.
Tom falls in love with every beautiful girl he meets.
Do you want to touch it?
I'm only interested in the truth.
I was warned not to believe what Tom said.
Tom works the late shift.
I only know what Tom told me.
Tom didn't come.
It's important that you tell the truth.
Tom paused for a moment before continuing with the story.
Why didn't Tom help you today?
Tom gave it to me.
Are you still living in Boston?
Do you know how my friends describe me?
Are you saying I'm wrong?
What does this sign say?
There is no future in this job.
Tom is the one most likely to win.
"Believe it or not, that is true."
They found Tom.
It's a good question.
"If you want, we can talk later."
Tom was disfigured.
Tom made up his mind not to do that.
I surprised myself.
Let me know when it's ready.
He's afraid that he might be late.
They won't help you.
I just know it's not right.
He must be around 40.
You don't want to go there.
We're not crazy.
You've got to trust me.
Tom hasn't seen Mary either.
I've never heard anyone swear like Tom.
I don't know anything about racing.
Tom is always in a hurry.
Do you have a course for beginners?
You must eat something.
I'd like to reserve a seat.
Tom doesn't think you understand me.
You were so right.
I want a notebook.
"Tom can swim, but not very well."
Stop talking loudly.
What exactly will it cost?
We won't forget you.
I don't have a dress good enough for such an occasion.
Your shoes are wet. Put them near the fire.
I really don't understand the question.
Let me show it to you.
Tom didn't wave back.
Do you still live where you used to live?
Tom and Mary aren't stupid.
Hit the brakes!
I know about that.
I was alone in the classroom.
Tom isn't trying to impress Mary.
Do you really have to work?
Please don't play near the railroad tracks.
I would never betray you.
Are you interested in politics?
You're taller than I expected.
Have you gone totally bonkers or what?
We're trying to find somebody who can speak French.
Tom skips classes too often.
Tom is hoping you'll help Mary.
"Have you ever had genuine Hungarian goulash? ""No, but I'd really like to."""
I don't think it's a problem.
This animal is very clever.
Tom told me he could fix it.
We'll do it tomorrow.
This is very wrong.
His crime deserved the death penalty.
What makes you think that I don't want to go?
Some people think that Earth will be invaded by aliens.
Why should Tom apologize to you?
Did you know Tom was dealing drugs?
They'll be afraid.
Tom decided to come with us.
Can we rest a while?
Apparently there's a cancellation charge of 30 percent.
You should never put on makeup while driving a car.
Her behavior is my primary concern.
He's obsessed with cleanliness.
Tom wants Mary to know that she can trust him.
Tom told me to stop talking.
Just don't tell anybody.
He left the motor running.
I'm younger than you.
Do you believe this is true?
I wish I had a girlfriend.
Tom said you shouldn't think about it.
He thinks that I am in love with her.
Does it upset you?
When did Tom come back?
"You shouldn't use the word ""gay"" as an insult."
"Don't interrupt me, Tom."
Tom's last girlfriend was Mary.
I'm certain Tom will pass the examination.
Tom wanted to be the best.
Don't ask me how it works.
Things like that happen sometimes.
Let's not waste time.
I thought Tom had stopped smoking.
Tom recognized me.
Does Tom know about this?
Where is your coat?
I didn't want to upset you.
I eventually left Boston.
Tom had only three dollars with him.
We have mutual friends.
The readers cannot ascertain whether the news is true or not.
Can I have a kiss?
Tom was told not to do that.
I can only tell you what I know.
I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy.
Tom knows who won.
It's a fruit.
Tom isn't a kid anymore.
What fun is that?
There is a big hole in your stocking.
They would never meet again.
Have you finished reading the book I lent you last week?
It's very kind of you to help me with my homework.
The contents of the four registers are preserved by the called subroutine.
I don't think Tom did anything wrong.
I'm sorry for making you cry.
We'd better leave now.
He married my cousin.
What's Tom's dog's name?
Tom asked about you.
Did you call Tom?
Show it to us.
She takes very good care of her clothes.
My mother bought me a new bicycle.
Didn't you know Tom was planning to move to Boston?
The knife punctured his lung.
Why didn't you tell me you didn't understand French?
You're always busy.
"From tomorrow on, I won't smoke anymore."
I'd like to call you sometime.
Tom doesn't usually show his feelings.
I hope Tom will understand.
"Strange to say, I didn't notice it."
"I liked Mary, not for her looks, but for her kindness."
Exhale through your mouth.
He'll be back by Monday morning at the latest.
She has very good manners.
Tom said he didn't want to think about it.
Tom is a professional basketball player.
You must be very hungry.
I am going to apply for a visa today.
I suggest you buy it.
My work here is done.
Do you think Tom could win?
Tom was an astute businessman who made a lot of money.
I can't bear living alone.
Tom didn't go upstairs.
There is a limit to everything.
We'll be late.
I thought you wanted to get married.
Did she say it?
How much honey do you need?
She asked me if she could use the phone.
Tom loves me and I love him.
Tom was a farmer.
Where are you hiding?
Tom saw his reflection in the mirror.
Where did you put the keys?
Tom rushed to Mary's aid.
The child threw a stone at the cat.
Tom's house is on the other side of the river.
You may use mine if you want to.
Those books are always in great demand.
Tom has no guts.
Please tell me where you bought that.
Do you think you could talk Tom into joining our team?
Tell me more about this.
Tom closed his eyes.
What's your mother's maiden name?
I would like steak with a baked potato.
Go now.
I want to see the ocean.
Do you really think Tom is better than I am?
Tom is the real hero.
I got to Boston yesterday afternoon.
Tom learned a few words of French.
This is very important to us.
What are you going to do to me?
Tom worked overtime.
Tom glided across the ice effortlessly.
Your parents will never allow you to go.
His dad calls him Tom.
He's as strong as a horse.
Tom and Mary don't even know each other.
This shirt costs ten dollars.
Grandmother sent us a box of apples.
Where would you like to sit?
You're the only Canadian I know.
Are you out of your mind?
Do we have anything else to eat?
Happy hour is from six until eight.
Didn't you know that Tom lived in Boston when he was a kid?
I'm old enough to make my own decisions.
That's what I wanted to ask.
How much candy did you eat?
I want an answer from you as soon as possible.
Let's go talk to Tom.
I wanted Tom to go to Boston with me.
I don't think Tom will help us.
I don't get enough sleep at night.
I was able to pass the test.
Tom got wounded.
I've always understood you.
Quit whining.
It makes me shiver just to think of it.
I think I can help you solve your problems.
"Of course, we're prepared."
"You agree with me, don't you?"
Do you like your job?
Tom's stoned.
She is bound to come here.
I always eat something before going to school.
We're extremely busy.
Our school stands on a hill.
Tom ignored Mary's question.
She burst out laughing when she saw me.
We are disturbing him.
No one's arguing with you.
That was very interesting.
Tears ran down my face.
You've made a horrible mistake.
Tom was the only one not wearing a suit.
How do you know where I live?
Australia is the smallest continent in the world.
Is there a restaurant around here?
Please tell me about what happened.
Could you stay and help me?
I'm making a list.
"You can see that I'm tired, can't you?"
How much cheese did you eat?
You've got a bright future ahead of you.
What a great view!
Thank you for the wonderful dinner.
Tom told me he wasn't ticklish.
It is very careless of you to leave the door open.
I knew you'd want to go with us.
Why didn't Tom tell us that he was going to be late?
I told you to stay in the house.
Tom is eating something.
"Tom was going to go to Boston to see Mary, but decided not to."
"Lend me your book, please."
I know that you lied.
I can't imagine life without music.
Some people started dancing.
He lived to be ninety.
There were few students left in the classroom.
My father likes pizza.
It's not as big a problem as you think it is.
Do you want me to tell Tom that?
I am tired of my monotonous life.
The airplane was flying above the clouds.
I continued taking photographs.
Tom doesn't listen to anyone.
The pizza is cooking in the oven.
Tom knew Mary wouldn't win.
I don't have the address now.
How long were you married?
One sniff of that stuff was enough to make me sick.
Glad you like it.
He's a singing teacher.
I know Tom was there.
I don't know what Tom found out.
Women hate you.
I like the color of your car.
She is proud of her students.
Don't blame them for what happened back in Boston.
My father often helps me with my homework.
I want Tom on the phone.
Where's my desk?
"Tom will be fine, won't he?"
Tom says that he needs a little more time.
We should help people in need.
Are you the boss?
I don't think it'll be easy for you to do that.
Why did this occur?
Many people use ATMs to withdraw money.
Give me back my ring.
I'm getting old.
His temperature is normal.
The children should go outside and play.
You have to believe me.
Tom said he felt cold.
I know her.
I'm sure you would have done the same for me.
Tom isn't busy anymore.
We'll meet at 2:30.
The room is dark.
I want to handle the problem myself.
The American Civil War is the central theme of the book.
Are you sure you can do that?
"I would cry, too, I that happened to me."
I hate mosquitoes.
"If you invite him, he'll probably come."
Don't get nervous.
Give me a little space.
I think that the problem is here.
Tom wouldn't do that.
Are you sure you won't come with me?
You're the only one who knows how to do this.
You won't be able to see Tom today.
Tom and Mary were busy.
Did you remember to turn on the alarm?
Tom made a lot of money.
I just wanted Tom to shut up.
Are you talking to me?
"How're you doing, Tom?"
Why did you like it?
This wasn't very expensive.
You're going to have to wait here.
I shut the door so that they couldn't hear us.
You may not like it.
It is pretty cold today.
Don't forget that there are exceptions.
Is Tom infected?
He washes his car at least once a week.
I have no home.
Tom didn't like the concert very much.
Were you flirting with Tom?
I looked at my watch.
I think you're probably right.
Get to work.
Do you know how to speak English?
Who gave you permission?
Haven't you decided yet?
It'll break.
I have to tell Tom.
I've never read a novel in French.
Tom's not from around here.
Are you going to stay long?
They kept quiet so that they would not be found.
Why did you show it to Tom?
You need a hobby.
Do you want to know what your problem is?
I'll never leave you.
Tom wasn't able to wake Mary up.
Are you talking about this?
I didn't thank Tom for his help.
Tom doesn't drink much.
Glass breaks easily.
I would never make a mistake like that.
I often have the same dream.
I guess Tom was right.
Help! I can't swim.
Tom says he'll do that by himself.
Tom will tell you what to do.
Stop staring at me.
Your prophecy has come true.
The torn dollar bill passed through several hands.
I could hardly believe my eyes.
Have you seen the news?
He asked that we be silent.
I still don't like it.
How many times do I have to tell you?
Let's sing a song.
We're greedy.
Their talks centered on their trip.
He is not wearing a hat.
I'm not here for that.
How do you know Tom did that?
Maybe you'd better leave.
One of the professors whispered.
Please weigh it again.
You don't need to come here anymore.
Your watch is on the desk.
I'm old-fashioned.
Grandpa bought it for me!
Is this your first visit to Japan?
Tom borrowed some money from me.
Olive oil is perishable.
"Go to bed, Tom. You need to get up early tomorrow morning."
He was visibly nervous.
Where is your patriotism?
What do you want me to tell Tom?
I don't know what you're so worried about.
Your room is the first one on the left.
There was no chance to finish the job on time.
Didn't you know Tom was a Canadian?
Is Tom ready yet?
Read me your speech.
She's going to have a baby.
Please call me at seven tomorrow morning.
Where will you put it?
Tom is working on a new song.
I think I'll go now.
Let's party.
I'm not much of an artist.
Tom is weakening.
Tell us a story.
I do that sometimes.
Words failed her.
How would you help Tom?
How does that work?
Tom is ill at ease among strangers.
I knew you wouldn't be there.
Tom got a visa.
Do you see what's happening?
You're so stuck up.
He's married.
I had lunch with Tom yesterday.
Tom taught Mary survival skills.
We're counting on you.
I'm not as talkative as you.
Tom said he thought we might have a problem.
You've already done the hard part.
I think that Tom said that.
What's your choice?
How are we going to get inside?
He was the last to leave.
"Eventually, Tom and Mary got married."
This laptop computer is very thin.
Anything can happen.
We can't swim here.
Tom lied to the cops.
Tom didn't drink all the milk.
Don't give me that.
I'm eating right now.
Tom pulled off his wig.
Give Tom some money.
"Hey, didn't you wear that shirt yesterday?"
Tom cracked several jokes before beginning his speech.
Who wants ice cream?
Don't be alarmed. He's not hurt badly.
Tom wants to become a ballet dancer.
All I want now is a glass of water.
We'll miss you.
Put these on.
Tom was the youngest.
We have no reason to be ashamed.
Are you a morning person?
I'm aware of your problems.
Did you stay in the same hotel as Tom?
When are you going to tell Tom?
This is the only way out.
Tom gently shook Mary awake.
She refused to take the money.
I had a date last night.
I can't really help you at all.
The teacher opened the box and took out a ball.
Tom won't come back here.
Tom spoke very well.
They both screamed.
Does she know you?
Who wants to take me home?
Are you going to cut down all these trees?
A harmony prevailed among them.
What else do you know?
I don't have much to spend.
I've got a lot of good ideas.
Tom was about to leave when it started raining really hard.
I would like to attend that lecture.
Tom doesn't care what Mary thinks.
"Everyone, say cheese."
I got a bug in my eye and I can't get it out.
Why are you denying it?
I'm waiting for my boyfriend.
I love you.
I'll see Tom today.
Why are you telling me this now?
I couldn't bear it.
Sickness kept me from attending the party.
We had nothing to do with it.
Can usernames be changed?
I've suddenly lost my appetite.
Tom is in love with another woman.
Does Tom have to walk to school every day?
I didn't know you'd be here.
They were chosen at random.
Who owns this ship?
She solved the problem with ease.
Tom smiled at me.
Please tell me how I can get in touch with her.
He arrived at midnight.
I know what you are thinking.
Watch your feet.
You'd better see for yourself.
Tom says Mary doesn't believe John really did that.
Please come on Monday.
Tom arrived three days ago.
They're safe.
How often are you sick?
You should've left earlier.
That's good to know.
It's not always easy.
I wanted to have children.
Tom felt something was wrong.
"I think you worry too much, Tom."
Hand me that magazine.
Does it hurt?
Tom doesn't need to go home now.
Tom and Mary have a small vegetable garden.
What am I looking at?
Why do you want to do this?
I must ride a bicycle.
Tom refused to wait for Mary.
How can you concentrate?
Tom won't need that.
I don't think the zoo is open today.
Why is the garage locked?
How are you going to stop Tom?
Sport knows no borders.
I shouldn't have eaten so much.
Why are you protesting against the government?
Tom is still in jail.
Call if you need me.
I need to see you right away.
I told Tom not to go to Australia.
I revised my theory.
Let's try to help Tom.
I'm not coming home yet.
She always keeps her room in good order.
Perhaps I'll like this book.
Tom should've listened to us.
Try to look happy.
Tom asked Mary if she knew how to read.
Tom also saw it.
It is possible that he may know the fact.
I hope you do that.
I think that Tom wants to sell us something.
We learned that the moon goes around the earth.
You can't ignore Tom.
"If you can't explain it easily, you don't yet understand it."
"Two fried eggs and coffee, please."
Who told you Tom wouldn't do that?
Is this the key you're looking for?
She was panting.
I'm not my father.
You're untrustworthy.
Can you think of anything else?
Let's try to understand one another.
You can't pretend this didn't happen.
These are difficult questions.
I have always fed my dog the dog food that comes in the big green bag.
Throw it to Tom.
Tom doesn't like cold weather.
I want you home by midnight.
"Couldn't we cuddle, instead?"
Tom likes to show off.
I want to be with you forever.
Didn't you know Tom had a house in Australia?
He is as hardworking as any.
I promised I wasn't going to do this.
Tom comes from the southern part of France.
I haven't yet met anyone I'd want to spend the rest of my life with.
Yesterday I heard you talking in your sleep.
I will kill you.
Hasn't this happened before?
Where did you put it?
She knows my wife.
"Well, I should get going."
Tom is a programmer.
Tell me their names.
Don't be condescending.
I have a 13-year-old son.
Tom deserves a pat on the back.
Can you speak French?
I wasn't happy.
What'll I tell Tom?
Tom won't likely be surprised.
Tom is the only one who knows for sure.
These keys are not mine.
Did Tom sing?
Did everyone sleep well?
Put it on my desk.
I can't believe Tom is a grandfather.
I forgave you a long time ago.
Tom had no idea if any of it was true.
Tom came to save me.
Do you really think so?
Where did you meet Tom?
Why did the prices go down?
I bought a new umbrella.
He went out of the room.
I wonder what they're whispering to each other.
You should give Tom some time.
A lot of people are waiting for Tom.
Tom never even asked Mary about that.
I let Tom kiss me.
Tom has read a lot of books about that.
His incompetence began to irritate everyone.
"His grandmother can't walk, can she?"
Who does this dog belong to?
You said that an hour ago.
I helped Tom decide where to put the sofa.
We don't know the truth yet.
What're you doing in my room?
I wrote a book three years ago.
Tom cooks chicken just the way Mary likes it.
I'll be back by six o'clock.
Tom tried to kill me.
I'll teach you how to play chess.
The cup is full.
"The phone rang, but nobody answered it."
Tom has never been skiing.
"More coffee, please."
Where's the Australian embassy?
When can you come to my home?
It was a fine sunny day.
Do you mind if I park here?
I don't like people like Tom.
Wait for your brother.
This is the list of all the people buried here.
What have you done with my pen?
They're insincere.
Tom told me you were sick.
Tom never goes to sleep before midnight.
Please tell her to call me back.
My computer cost a lot of money.
It all happened three months ago.
Please wait until 3:00. She'll be back then.
That was obvious.
I'll give you what you want.
I forgot to ask your name.
I want to know when that happened.
"At last, my turn came."
How many people have you saved?
I'm not going to apologize to Tom.
You should prepare for the worst.
Tom spoke slowly.
Tom is a great guy.
She came close to falling off the platform.
She screamed that I was to blame.
Tom told me he wasn't going to wait for us.
The boy lifted the heavy box with one hand.
You're the one I love.
Tom has been late every day this week.
I may come here tomorrow.
I'll get in touch with Tom by telephone tomorrow and ask him to give us a hand.
That's an interesting proposal. I'll think about it.
Who is playing the piano?
Go out and get some more firewood.
You may leave if you want.
I didn't show it to anyone.
I had to choose between the two.
He probably won't come.
Tom and Mary both smiled.
"If you're low on money, this one will be on me."
You have no right to go there.
Tom treated me badly.
I'm not sure I want to see it.
It's not yours.
This has all been a misunderstanding.
The police suspect it was a murder.
I lent my umbrella to Tom.
The circumstances are different now.
I was poisoned.
"Can I have a towel, please?"
I'm not a rookie anymore.
You're the worst.
Let's play volleyball.
Vice President Roosevelt hurried to Buffalo.
Tom got caught speeding.
I want you to drive.
Tom told me he didn't want to eat any more.
Tom came by my desk to ask me a question.
I have a message for you.
Don't worry about Tom. He always acts that way.
I need to buy a new bicycle.
What does Tom do on Mondays?
Tom blackmailed Mary.
I'm going to have to call you back.
You can always rely on them.
I've been very lucky.
I'm cured.
Tom was winning.
Tom said he wasn't used to this kind of hot weather.
You've got an hour.
Tom's room isn't very big.
I'm not going to let you down.
Tom didn't want to talk to Mary.
Please don't forget me.
Tom hasn't been to Boston since 2013.
He was made to sign the contract against his will.
Tom doesn't get up as early as Mary.
Tom hoped that Mary was OK.
Don't drop the soap.
I prefer walking to driving in a big city like Tokyo.
Tom didn't go to Mary's funeral.
It took a long time to do that.
It's the best-kept secret in town.
I know that Tom is lazy.
Where are my car keys?
How can you trust these people?
Tom is almost asleep.
One and three are odd numbers.
Is that your sister?
Where's the other half of the money?
"You like coffee, don't you?"
I wasn't able to defend myself.
I worked hard to compensate for the loss.
Are you going to attend ceremony?
She is much younger than Tom.
The cliff hangs over the sea.
Are you getting sleepy?
I never played golf.
I trust Tom.
I'm mature.
Do you want to go on a picnic with me?
I don't think that Tom has any friends.
I think you did that intentionally.
The water is icy.
We have a right to know.
Are you finished yet?
"Unfortunately, the food supplies gave out before the end of winter."
I want to get out of prison.
Not everyone here can speak French.
I surely hope you can help us.
Don't you want to talk about anything?
Are you happy?
I won't sign this.
Do exactly what we tell you.
Where is your dog?
Tom was depressed.
Can we trust her?
I don't know how to explain it.
It's amazing I'm still alive.
I thought I'd do that.
Tom is a dangerous man.
She has many handkerchiefs.
It's getting cloudy.
It's time you stopped watching television.
Tom says he doesn't have any enemies.
Just relax and be yourself.
I didn't want to make the same mistake twice.
I think Tom probably knows about it already.
I wanted to make sure you were here.
Did Tom ever hurt you?
I didn't plan to fall in love with you.
Tom can ride a horse.
I'll come and see you later.
Do you have doubts?
I'll fix it now.
Do you want me to finish it?
That's not going to happen.
I know that you are learning French at school.
I'm sure Tom can't swim.
Tom wants you to call him back as soon as possible.
We are badly in want of water.
Who are you going with?
Will you let Tom drive?
Tom loves talking about art.
You have to hurry.
Tom told his side of the story.
What've I ever done to you?
Japan is a rich country.
I may have to fire Tom.
This is my mother's recipe.
I flunked out of school.
What would you propose?
Why did you eat so much?
You'll be mine.
I am studying English in my room.
Put it over there.
I don't approve of it.
Is it possible to cry underwater?
I have a guilty conscience about that.
I like sleeping.
Tom has serious problems.
Do you remember the question?
Tom doesn't want to ask Mary for help.
Tom spent the evening reading a book.
I couldn't hear what they were saying.
How long are you going to stay here?
The crowd was mostly women and children.
Thanks for your patience.
It looks like you came prepared.
How do you know that I don't have it?
I know where you can hide.
Why didn't you let me know you were in Australia?
Let me go!
It was your grandfather's.
I really thought Tom liked me.
She presented him with a box of Havana cigars.
Tom's cat is fighting with Mary's cat.
Why did Tom leave you?
Tom is the guy who hit Mary.
I've never been so proud of Tom.
I don't want you to do this.
I can't eat.
Tom complained about the noise.
I'd like to find out when Tom's birthday is.
The actor died at the height of his popularity.
That's not what I wanted to tell you.
He says he's related to that rich family.
I took a risk when I made the investment.
I've been out looking for Tom.
I'm convinced Tom isn't guilty.
Do you think Mary would go out with me if I asked her on a date?
So how did the date go?
Tom said he wasn't from Boston.
I don't think that it's cold.
Tom was surprised by Mary's behavior.
Please correct it.
I have no regrets.
These details won't be published.
The ground started to shake and the alarm rang.
People were watching.
That's the most beautiful sound in the world.
I wonder why Tom came here today.
"At first, I didn't believe you."
You'll get a lot of presents on your birthday.
The doctor told her that she should take a rest.
I didn't know what I wanted.
Give it a try.
Tom thought he'd never see his son again.
How long did you go out with Tom?
Can you tell the difference?
Let's look for something better.
I hope you come to my lecture.
You shouldn't have said that.
She is no less beautiful than her sister.
The child talks as if he were a man.
Tom needs to talk to Mary about the problem.
I think it's too early to go home.
She always practices the piano before dinner.
Is he coming by train or by bus?
Tom ran barefoot in the snow.
It's only a theory.
Have you solved the mystery?
Why are you doing this?
Didn't you know that Tom was in a coma for three years?
Tom takes a bus to his office.
You'll find this book very interesting.
Was Tom the one who told you to do that?
You should observe the school rules.
Did you forget to talk to Tom this morning?
How much is that in dollars?
Where do you see him?
Did you really have a fight with Tom?
I've made a discovery.
I think you're wrong about that.
Tom is afraid that Mary will say no.
The weather is unusually cold.
That's not what I wanted to show you.
I rarely complain about anything.
I want you to stand up.
Maybe they'll find something.
Tom hurt his right hand.
It took Tom a long time to find Mary's house.
I don't think that Tom knows when Mary came to Boston.
Parallel lines do not intersect each other.
Who threw a pie at Tom?
"Tom is obstinate, isn't he?"
Tom is playing outdoors.
Why did you bring us here?
That won't happen anymore.
Tom and his brother look very similar.
Tom is a man who can be trusted.
You know that I don't like Tom.
He is but a child.
Don't talk to your mother like that!
Tom is anorexic.
Is that a castle?
I don't like the way you're talking to me.
Have you read my report?
Now drink up.
Who found her?
I'll talk to Tom about it.
I'm all alone here.
I think you're drunk.
I can't sleep any more.
May I borrow your car?
Tom is timid.
"Tom's heart stopped, but doctors managed to revive him."
Tom paid three dollars for a sandwich.
They don't have to go to school today.
The two rooms are connected.
We were surrounded.
I brought some pizza.
"Give me the phone, OK?"
How many times do I have to say I'm not married?
"We hear you, Tom."
Don't talk with your mouth full.
They arrived at the hotel.
A stapler is very useful for attaching papers together.
I saw the car hit a man.
Tom decided the best thing to do was to go to Boston.
Tom still hasn't completely recovered.
I've already promised Tom that I'd help him.
Help me find an empty room for myself.
She did her best to rescue him.
Tom told Mary not to worry about him.
A lot of people do this.
They wanted to earn money.
You're my friends.
This is a hundred dollar bill.
I learned from my mistakes.
Do you bind books?
I wake up at half past six in the morning.
Is this what you want me to do?
You could ask Tom.
Where's the list?
I want you to do that with Tom.
Whose book is it?
I don't want to do that now.
It would be nice if you helped me a little.
I'd never seen anything like that before.
"I hear you, but I don't see you."
Listen carefully.
Tom gave us the key.
This box is almost empty.
What time did Tom eat lunch?
The newly married couple walked hand in hand.
Tom checked the date.
Can you tell me why Tom did that?
Tom had no idea that Mary liked him.
He doesn't know that I'm Japanese.
Tom doesn't need to worry about me.
Tom and Mary tell each other everything.
Tom was thirsty.
We'll look after Tom.
"The more, the merrier."
Didn't you know Tom saw you in the park this morning?
I can't put up with his behavior any longer.
Tom speaks French very fluently.
"If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him."
Ask Tom to apologize to Mary.
I've spent all my money.
What's your favorite dessert with bananas?
"He has two daughters, both of whom are married to doctors."
I don't think that Tom needs to tell Mary how to do that.
Tom is going to Boston with me.
She's not as tall as he is.
I suspect that Tom doesn't want to do that again.
Tom is more intelligent than I am.
Did you say something?
Are you sure you remember everything?
Tom is the only one I'll talk to.
"Tom likes playing tennis, but I don't."
Why don't you leave them alone?
She was moved to tears by the story.
You'll miss me.
Have you heard the latest rumors?
This is my assistant.
He wrote a book about his adventures in the jungle.
We wouldn't want to do that.
She identified him as the murderer.
I've read the report.
Tom found out where Mary lives.
Don't put the glass near the edge of the table.
He ripped up all her letters and photos.
My mother is making dinner.
Nobody was watching.
I asked Tom if anyone was in the classroom.
He has a basket full of strawberries.
This building belongs to us.
Do you really want to know where we went?
We don't want to go to your wedding.
The price is too high.
The gate was left open.
Do you want to go there?
Do you like tennis?
He became a handsome young man.
I don't understand Dutch. It's difficult.
Please put your phone down.
I wanted to stay home.
Can I have another sandwich?
Tom hasn't taken a bath in a week.
When do you play tennis?
I think that anyone can do that.
"You were happy, weren't you?"
I've been forgiven.
This should be enough.
Where did you find Tom?
Did you show it to Tom?
It's one of my favorite movies.
There are few places to park around here.
I don't want to see Tom today.
You'll need to do that sooner or later.
I just want to sleep.
I always take what Tom says with a grain of salt.
Can you move this desk by yourself?
Tom and I are playing tennis.
He is said to be very poor.
I called you this afternoon.
You forgot to mention that.
I saw Tom again.
I read your book.
I know I don't have a choice.
I really want to impress Tom.
Who does Tom pal around with?
We're a bit late.
I hear voices in my head.
We were having a lot of fun until Tom arrived.
I finally talked Tom into lending me his bicycle.
Thank you very much for your gift.
I felt guilty about it.
This isn't paper.
This desk is made of hard wood.
She is not a fan of winter sports.
Tom is the tallest boy in our class.
I like cities.
She was admitted to the club.
Try that one.
I know about you.
"Mary is in her room, putting on lipstick."
Maybe it was fate.
Tom wanted to start his own business.
We're all going.
I hate carrots.
I missed you today.
Tell me what you have.
Tom looked so different after his haircut.
Tom didn't mention why he couldn't come.
I told you I'm not ready.
Tom didn't remember anything.
You need to wait.
Who will you give the book to?
Tom did his best.
Just tell us what happened.
Tom was too young to vote.
Does anybody live here?
Do you want to take this one?
Please understand my position.
What happened last week?
I don't think that Tom was busy yesterday.
We have enough water.
Who needs them?
"Hey, don't do that!"
Tom told me he didn't know anybody named Mary.
Tom never stopped loving you.
What was he doing there?
Tom had a good reason.
I'm getting ready for bed.
Tom sometimes comes home late.
"Tom speaks five languages, but doesn't know how to be polite in any of them."
You're probably right again.
I invited some friends for dinner. I hope you don't mind.
Let's hash it all out.
The toy store is closed.
Do you know how to spell Tom's last name?
Didn't you know that I don't have a driver's license?
I saw some monkeys climbing the tree.
The weather was terrible.
I need to charge my cellphone.
I'm tired of waiting for things to happen.
Would you like a glass of red wine?
Don't ask who I am.
I have something important to discuss with Tom.
I didn't know that Tom had children.
I would love a cold glass of beer.
He's unable to do that.
Stay away from there.
That's something I'd never ever do.
What do you think of my idea?
Stop blaming yourself.
Don't sleep with the windows open.
We're so happy for you.
How many hamburgers did you eat?
That won't work.
There will be a blizzard.
You have to face the facts.
Tom won't ask Mary to do that.
It isn't my place to question Tom's methods.
It didn't cost that much.
Tom has known Mary since he was a child.
That seems correct to me.
Tom told me Mary wasn't afraid.
Tom and Mary always talk about the same old things. It gets kind of boring.
We can't ignore this problem.
I filled both glasses with wine.
This fact proves her innocence.
The boy was almost drowned.
I have a good idea.
"Tom doesn't have a bicycle, but I do."
I thought Tom would ask Mary to do that.
You won't be fired.
You aren't as short as I am.
Does Tom eat meat?
The only thing that Tom drinks is coffee.
I seldom do that in the evening.
Tom is a busy man.
Did you turn off the gas?
Is there room in your car for me?
"If you speak French, I won't understand."
Tom shouldn't have done what he did.
He is busy preparing for the examination.
Call me when you return.
I came here to save you.
I don't think you understand the situation.
Can you tell me why Tom is doing that?
Tom is due back any second.
I'm glad to see you're happy.
My father gave up smoking last year.
He is too drunk to drive home.
The price of books is getting higher these days.
I've been living in Canada for five years.
"Let's forget this, OK?"
Please help Tom hang up the laundry.
Why is it so dark in here?
Unlock the door.
It's naive to believe otherwise.
I must send for the doctor.
Why did Tom leave you?
I'm not mad.
Can't we just leave?
Tom is busy preparing for his trip.
I lost my key.
Tom kept walking back and forth.
I hope you don't get fined for doing that.
How long have you already spent in Australia?
Tom couldn't contain his joy.
Tom doesn't like being treated like a child.
Did you like Tom's concert?
You must do your best.
French is difficult to learn.
I want to make sure you are who you say you are.
That's a very old picture.
Tom hasn't studied French yet.
You have to ask Tom first.
No one knows where we are.
We haven't been paid for three months.
Don't open those windows.
I don't want to rest.
This is my lucky day.
Was Tom handsome?
He tiptoed into the room.
Can I ask a favor?
We haven't begun yet.
Do you know where the dog is?
We'll be building a new airport.
Why don't you call Tom and remind him?
I threw Tom the ball.
Tom doesn't look anything like his brother.
Tom told me he didn't want to go with us.
I should've told Tom to stay in Australia.
I didn't expect you so soon.
I thought that Tom was married.
Tom played the piano and Mary sang.
She studies English.
I opened a checking account.
She greets him every morning as he enters the school building.
How was the seminar?
You should pay back your debts.
Tom found me a good job.
I'll buy it.
Have you paid the electric bill?
Is something wrong with your eyes?
"What's wrong with you, Tom?"
No one survived the plane crash.
She does not know how to ski.
I didn't sing.
I think Tom is in the garden.
I knew that I was going to be punished.
We were dead tired from the five-hour trip.
How old is he?
I thought you moved to Boston.
I want to do more.
He hoped the problem would solve itself.
I'm going back inside.
It was pretty bad.
Can you play the piano well?
I don't like women who wear way too much make up.
I thought that was my job.
I'm sure that Tom is a very busy man.
The old woman fell and could not get up.
We'll see you at 2:30.
Give me that.
Where is the bus schedule?
I almost forgot.
"If you don't do what I tell you to do, I can't be responsible for the consequences."
We've decided to postpone the meeting till next Monday.
We stayed at the Hilton Hotel.
The old man lived in the three-room apartment.
Who did Tom go bowling with?
My jeans shrank after I washed them.
"By the way, how old are you?"
I don't think that Tom can do that without my help.
You're skinny.
Thanks for warning me.
Sometimes Tom does that and sometimes he doesn't.
Tom started screaming at Mary.
You always exaggerate.
I know where Tom went.
I thought you'd be happy.
I studied French last night.
I hope that Tom will come.
I already know how to do that.
I heard explosions.
Why didn't you wake me?
Didn't you know Tom was going to be in Australia this week?
My wallet was stolen while I was asleep.
Let's go back to the beginning.
I asked Tom if he needed money.
I've never told you what actually happened.
I went to Kawagoe by taxi.
A monster lay on a rock near the top of the mountain.
I'm not prepared for this.
You don't need to do that.
I have a feeling that I've been here before.
Tom is probably still at home.
Just put it here.
I know that you're currently writing a book.
The hour hand is broken.
He had every reason for doing so.
Did you know Tom well?
Tom told me how to get to his house.
Yours was better than mine.
Tom can do that better than me.
Let's fire Tom.
Is there anyone else?
It happened last October.
I'm very sensitive to cold. May I have another blanket?
Tom's unhappy.
Tom was taken prisoner by the Germans.
I wish you good luck.
Tell Tom I've got his keys.
Tom turned off his headlights.
May I go to the zoo tomorrow?
There's no need to do that.
Do you want me to translate?
Few students knew his name.
These flowers have died.
When is the next train for Boston?
Do you have an extra ticket?
Just put it here.
You should try doing that by yourself.
I don't think anyone noticed what we were doing.
I sent Tom out of the room.
Tom is about to cry.
I need to warn Tom.
I didn't know that you weren't Canadian.
You're no saint.
She selected a hat to match her new dress.
It is difficult to talk to him.
I didn't know Tom was your cousin.
I'd like to be alone if you don't mind.
I don't want anyone to see that.
Good health is more valuable than anything else.
Always do what is right.
Tom said he had something for you.
I wonder why I didn't think of that.
The net weight is three kilograms.
Do you want wine?
He made her a new coat.
It's not going to snow.
You'll need a special tool to do it.
I was a little worried.
We took a cab.
"As far as I know, Tom has never tried to commit suicide."
I'll visit Boston with Tom.
Tom got mugged.
He was surprised to find his stolen bag.
He's a lovely young man.
What kind of music did you listen to when you were a teenager?
Why don't you look for Tom?
She has a swimming pool.
"Wherever you go, you'll be welcomed."
"I was the one who did that, not you."
"Give that to me, please."
Don't turn off your computer.
Be careful not to overcook the carrots.
I think that would be best.
I often go fishing with them.
Who's coming?
Does this ring a bell?
He didn't keep his word.
I watched it on YouTube.
How much money did you make last year?
I'll be at my desk.
Why aren't you ready?
Do you want to help me?
Your mother wouldn't like it if she knew we were seeing each other.
What do you think of Tom?
Tom is eating cookies.
You are too young to travel alone.
Tom wanted to leave Boston.
What if Tom starts asking questions?
I just want Tom to go away.
I'm ashamed of you.
I have no idea of what to do.
Why didn't you show me this before?
I told Tom about what had happened.
Everybody started laughing at me.
Do you think she's attractive?
It'll be tough.
Don't talk to the bus driver while he's driving.
You did that wrong.
She can be trusted to some degree.
Tom is a very generous man.
Quality is more important than quantity.
I went to Boston in 2013.
Do you have any beans in your garden?
You wouldn't survive.
Do your parents permit you to do that?
I hope I'm out of the hospital before October.
That didn't help much.
No one spoke up in his defense.
Tom wants to see us.
They smiled at each other.
Did you wash that?
"It hurt so much I could have screamed, but I gritted my teeth and bravely bore the pain."
You broke the rule.
I don't know which doctor she meant.
What would you do if you were in my place?
I'm a little scared.
It's people like you who give Boston a bad name.
I didn't order it.
We need permission.
I'm glad you're having a good time.
You're not trying.
Only love can break your heart.
Tom told me about your suspicions.
I know both of the girls.
This is a great question.
I think it's time for me to buy a house.
Don't make eye contact.
Tom gets very animated when he's watching rugby on TV.
Tom forged his father's signature.
Tom put his phone back in his pocket.
When did that end?
I asked the butcher to trim all the fat off of the meat.
When was the last time you spoke with Tom?
Unsaturated fats are essential to a healthy diet.
I understood very well.
I'm not related to Tom.
I'll get used to it.
Who helped you?
Who disagreed?
Tom told everyone to sit down.
Tom already knew that.
I know you were born in Boston.
We talked over the phone.

"Put the box wherever you can find room for it, please."

Why is she doing this?
Stop babbling.

Help yourself.

Stop being so naive.
Tom said that Mary wasn't afraid of John.

Did Tom say anything about who he was with?
We were rebels.
You're unambitious.

I'm glad that I said that.
I didn't know what to say next.
The police held the crowd back.

Tom sometimes watches TV.
I could hardly close the suitcase.

Help Tom study.
I've got a few questions for you.

I like him because he is honest.
Luck's on my side today.

Why are they saying that?
"He is short, but strong."
Tom is drunk.
Send Tom to me.
He's a kind person.
It was a trap.
They're eating sandwiches.
Tom doesn't know the difference between a fable and a fairytale.

I have to fight.
You shouldn't try to do that by yourself.
Old habits die hard.

I thought the food was too greasy.

How many hours did you put in at the office last week?
Why don't we check?
You're a great kisser.
I prefer to stay here.
The monkey got away.
I need mine.
Tom didn't like it one bit.
Tell me where to put this.
Are you in a lot of pain?
You're no doctor.
Tom wouldn't blame you.
You know this is a mistake.
They hated Tom.
Tom is blaming Mary.
I thought this was just between us.

That's an interesting name.
They executed Tom.
Tom is not here.
An old man sat next to me on the bus.
Are you going to give Tom anything for Christmas?
Do you have any children?
Tom can't help me today.
They say that the mayor takes bribes.

I like skating better.
She says she brushes her teeth every morning.
Tom opened the trunk of the car.
I don't even know where Tom lives.
He'll call me around six.
I was not drunk.
How was your vacation?
Tom guessed right.
Tom had to go by himself.
Tom told me he did nothing wrong.
Let Tom talk.
She survived her husband by ten years.
Come and look for yourself.
That will happen later.
I had an accident at work.
Tom didn't take off his shirt.
The devil is in the details.
You have to eat.
He said his name was Tom.
I thanked her for her kind hospitality.
Do you have anything to say?

There was a castle here many years ago.
I tried to do it.

I had to pay a large sum of money to get it back.
I'll buy the most expensive one.
I left it unlocked.
I'm going to meet Tom.
I'm a schoolteacher from Boston.
Where I am doesn't matter.
Don't ruin our fun.
Tom was looking for you this morning.
I'm like you.
Can I go with you?
I can't refuse my grandchildren anything.
I bought a wonderful watch for her.
I'll be in the attic.
Can you hear me?
A strange man came up to us.
I was just going to ask you the same question.
I used to like you a lot.
Tom thinks I love him.
Tom shot him.
How many people have you killed?
I'm the tallest kid in my class.
You're the only one I know who likes Tom.
Tom asked Mary what her plans for the future were.
How many cans of beer did you buy?
We've been living here since October.
You better hide.
You've passed the exam.
What did I do that for?
You can't leave us here.
I didn't lie to Tom.
Do you know where Tom bought his new computer?
Tom could understand why Mary was angry.
I think that's pretty stupid.
This watch is expensive.
You're free now.
Why is Tom acting this way?
Do you really need this?
That didn't surprise us at all.
I wonder whether Tom could win.
I caught three fish today.
Can I eat this cake?
I believe you're wrong.
Don't look at Tom. Look at me.
Tom knows his job.
Tom has paid back what he owes us.
He left the room as soon as I entered it.
You must come home.
My head hurts.
Put the bag down.
I am yours and you are mine.
I want you to take this with you.
He couldn't fulfill a promise he had made to his father.
I don't know anything about this project.
Tom is not a communist.
What time did you get back?
Tom has changed quite a lot.
We must win at all costs.
Are you still eating?
You don't need to go there.
This is all I want to say.
Tom was a chain smoker.
Tom slipped on the ice.
You look fabulous.
Is that all you can say?
I wanted you to come.
I thought we'd surprise you.
Tom is a florist.
My brother is good at playing tennis.
Of course I did that.
Do you smoke?
I don't think Tom is correct.
Tom is a gardener.
My father used to bring me here when I was a kid.
Tom took his dog for a walk.
What kind of activities you enjoy the most?
What can you tell me about Tom?
Where on earth have you been all this time?
Tom said I sounded angry.
We're going there alone.
I showed it to Tom.
Things are not always what they seem.
Tom was finally able to win.
Spring has come.
Can I speak to you in private?
What time are you coming back?
I told you that Tom wanted to go to Australia.
I wasn't a bit tired.
Don't forget to take a camera.
Are you going to eat?
Did you find the leak?
I don't like spiders.
I didn't know you at the time.
What's the matter with Tom?
I met him in the crowd.
Why didn't you tell me this on the phone?
When did you come?
I left my gloves in the library.
I have no idea when that'll happen.
Tom is our neighbor.
Tom is going to get killed if he's not careful.
Who else can answer my question?
I can assure you everything is under control.
Let me help you with your other problem instead.
I wanted to help Tom.
Tom told me Mary's secret.
What did you give Tom?
I participated in the discussion.
I won't let Tom leave.
The view from the summit is very nice.
Who's responsible for this problem?
"You're not going to give up, are you?"
Tom smiles a lot.
He had a smile on his face.
Did you lose something?
I'm still here.
Take notes.
I'd like to interview Tom.
The deer fell a prey to the lion.
You may continue.
Tell me about your teacher.
"If you'll get a needle and thread, I'll sew your button on."
I made this chair.
Your statements contradict each other.
I'll come at 2:30.
He lives in Tokyo now.
Be our guest.
Have you fully recovered?
Are you home alone?
I'm very unhappy here.
Tom could've done it.
Is it always like this?
The newspaper said that contact with the plane had been lost.
I'm autistic.
Tom said he'd like to visit Boston.
I hope you're not in any hurry.
Please tell me a story.
I'm really very busy.
Did that really cost you three hundred dollars?
"If Tom had a lot of money, he'd buy that for you."
It seems that he took me for my sister.
She will be happy to know you want to see her.
It seems to me that something's wrong.
What are you expecting to find here?
It's my money.
Tom has a curfew.
They're absolutely right.
I want you to stop doing that.
"Well, then, if you want me to I'll do it."
Tom said he'd be home this evening.
I want to shake your hand.
Tom became upset and began to cry.
I asked Tom to come.
I don't know when Tom will show up.
I don't usually wear a tie to work.
I know Tom is fine.
I know that Tom wants to get married.
Tom didn't want to sing.
I hope you all learn something.
Can we afford that?
I'll kill you.
The patient is feverish this afternoon.
You're still young.
Everybody's hungry.
What do you do in Japan?
Tom took piano lessons for several years.
I don't want to disappoint you.
We're getting out of here. The storm is coming.
We'll be late for dinner.
Can I wait for Tom here?
Tom really needs you.
Have you ever thought of becoming a writer?
Did you tell them anything?
I don't like writing.
We're all alone.
I can't afford it.
Have you told anybody?
These two lines are at right angles.
When do you want to go?
Please keep in touch.
The rich are getting richer.
"Tom is worried about that, isn't he?"
I inquired about the book in many stores.
I think you know that we have to do that today.
"Excuse me, but may I use the phone?"
"I'll call you tomorrow, OK?"
Tom is trying to sell his house.
What did Tom study in college?
Tom knows that he was wrong.
Insects are arthropods.
"Hey, here's a thought."
He knows a lot about wild animals.
How much will you give me for this?
I don't sleep anymore.
I hope to participate.
You make me feel so guilty.
Young people tend to think so.
Tom doesn't believe me.
"Even though my friend was a vegetarian, I didn't tell him that the soup had some meat in it."
Are you going to be here long?
We have to face the truth.
That's a little weird.
I don't want to sit next to you.
Why are you lying?
It's too early.
Can you call him?
Will it rain today?
Do you feel guilty?
I still think Tom is guilty.
She got to the other side in 10 minutes.
Tom was bitten by a bat.
I don't believe you've met him.
Tom didn't know what hit him.
I'm not sure why.
Most people think so.
I thought the same thing.
"If I can do that, so can you."
That's not the reason.
Tom was in a car accident.
Tom ignored my warning.
I need to ask you for a little favor.
Is anyone afraid?
The public is invited.
"At the dance, everyone raved about my gown."
It wasn't a mistake.
Tom is smiling.
"Instead of asking Tom to do it, why don't you just do it yourself?"
"Tom tried on the coat, but it didn't fit."
I suspect that Tom won't want to dance with Mary.
I'm blessed.
I'm glad to be alive.
It's only a scratch.
You have a guest.
Tom looks slightly puzzled.
Tom knows you.
Things are changing.
I'll do that if you ask me to.
Mary is a very beautiful and interesting woman.
Suicide is a desperate act.
Can you say that one more time?
We want to vote.
Tom accused Mary of stealing his wallet.
Tom remained silent for some time.
Tom decided to quit smoking.
I'm going to bed. Good night.
Which one do you choose?
I'm not going to say it wasn't easy.
I said don't talk to me.
The decision was made for him.
I know who he is.
I thought that you lived in Boston.
I got this vacuum cleaner for nothing.
Tom will make an announcement at 2:30.
He's wearing a hat.
"I'm sorry, I forgot your name."
Is this enough for you?
I know absolutely nothing about that.
There's no response.
Let's not discourage Tom.
Tom drank his wine.
I thought you said you didn't want to do that.
The teacher warned us that the test would be hard.
I want my key back.
Tom flung the door open.
I know who stole your diary.
I can't go to work today.
We needed to act quickly.
She was told to accompany me.
May I change the channel?
I think you should find out when Tom plans to leave.
Have you already been there?
You have an e-mail message in your inbox.
"I tried to talk Tom out of it, but he wouldn't listen."
Women generally live longer than men.
Why are you surprised?
I didn't marry him because he is rich.
I will provide you all the necessary information.
We've come here to help.
Did you show it to your parents?
It was only a bad dream.
Yours is over there.
This spoils all my plans.
I thought that you were Canadian.
Tom will sue you.
I swear I'll pay you back.
You don't need to tell me.
She lived there by herself.
This one belongs to Tom.
Tom has been working all morning.
Tom and I make decisions together.
Does anyone know what time it is?
I hope Tom can help me do that.
I have flat feet.
No one from Tom's family attended the wedding.
I don't know what has become of him.
The victim had been beaten up and left for dead.
You need to sleep.
I should've studied more when I was young.
I want you to leave my family alone.
How important is this?
They tied the thief to the tree.
She didn't press him for an explanation.
I'm going to Boston with Tom.
Tom moved away from the window.
I've won.
Can we hurry this up?
I've never had that problem.
I don't go fishing as much as I used to.
Tom hoped Mary could help him.
What were you thinking?
I'll never forget.
It took me a little more time than usually to fall asleep.
You have tons of friends.
Isn't that what they want?
Look at my arm.
Obey your parents.
Don't you want something to drink?
Tom is way older than he looks.
It's a puzzle to me how such a stupid guy ever got through college.
Tom saw Mary looking at him and blushed.
My great-grandfather was a Canadian.
Tom will try to be there on time.
I know who Tom is.
They remained friends.
It rarely snows here.
"Tom is your son, not mine."
She died yesterday afternoon.
Are you a vegetarian?
You won't believe what Tom told me.
The clasp on this necklace is broken.
We don't want that.
Tom wondered why Mary was crying.
I'm still waiting for your answer.
We're leaving Australia next month.
Why is everyone staring at us?
The other day I discovered a book written by my father.
I thought you had fixed it.
We need some more firewood.
Tom didn't want to wake up the kids.
"You owe me $1,000."
Let's go inside and talk.
Tom often said that.
"Tom wanted to go, but he didn't."
We're looking for survivors.
What are you looking at?
I really can't wait any longer.
Tom was born and raised on a farm.
I hope to be able to visit Boston someday.
These pictures are really very beautiful.
This melody is familiar to many Japanese.
I'm surprised to see you.
This train gets to Chicago at 9 o'clock tonight.
You have to listen.
Tom put a diamond ring on Mary's finger.
I thought Tom was in prison.
I'm the one who needs to talk to Tom.
The most wonderful thing about baseball is teamwork.
I'm not old enough.
I'm sorry. I forgot about this.
You'll be plenty sorry.
Why do you know so much about Boston?
Can I talk to you privately?
I thought you enjoyed swimming.
I've been tormented by regret.
Why don't you email me?
I knew your brother.
I'm still not giving up.
Tom told me he needed more time.
You lean on your parents too much. You must be more independent.
Thank you for doing this.
Ask Tom if you don't believe me.
I'm very happy with it.
We never went anywhere when I was a kid.
I apologize. It was my mistake.
I'm not a cat person.
Tom swam in the pool.
Let's not discuss it.
I tried to make friends.
Thirteen people were killed.
Tom must've heard something.
The problem is you're not Canadian.
I don't think that this is correct.
I seem to be unlucky today.
Tom is a little behind schedule.
Let's go for a drive.
The police are investigating what happened here.
I'd never heard that before.
His behavior is very odd today.
Tom was surprised.
We were both happy.
Her parents loved me.
My apartment is near.
The cat is under the sofa.
"I'm sorry, I can't do it."
I can't believe you got married.
I met Tom at a wine auction a few years ago.
Tom is former FBI.
I needed cash.
It was a dangerous time.
They couldn't stop smiling.
I'm very fast.
"I'm going to be there, too."
Have you found a job?
This novel is so easy that even a child can read it.
Don't try too hard.
Tom didn't show.
I didn't like the ending of that movie.
I am looking for my friends.
What time will you have to go to bed?
I'm not serious.
Tom had a weapon.
I'll give you a new one.
Some things are best left unsaid.
I don't think the roses will bloom so soon.
I finally found Tom.
It's still here.
He must not find out the truth.
"I just know his name, that's all."
I've been in Australia several years.
He was wearing glasses.
I don't like learning irregular verbs.
Tom is trying hard to quit smoking.
Everyone believed you.
When did you sing?
You're the expert.
We received word of his death.
I'm still up.
I didn't know you were back in town.
Please make us some tea.
Do you know that guy?
He was also kind to animals.
You're lucky Tom is your friend.
Tom will never win again.
Where did I put the car key?
Keep digging.
His story moved her to tears.
You haven't told me your name yet.
I have a grandson and three granddaughters.
Please tell us about yourself.
We know you're still there.
Are you prepared for the worst?
Please read my reply carefully.
You don't have to do that here.
Tom is a fire eater.
Tom has nothing to do with this.
This box is too small.
I want to eat spaghetti.
I would never hurt anyone.
Gasoline is used for fuel.
The police went over every inch of this place.
I was a prison warden for ten years.
Those bananas are delicious.
We'll contact you.
Hold out your left hand.
Let's move it.
He instantly denied it.
I've never met a Canadian before.
She advised him not to borrow money from his friends.
You know better.
We're old friends.
He is difficult to get along with.
Please give me a little more tea.
"If I remember correctly, Tom's birthday is in October."
I'll give you some examples.
They fixed it.
Everybody was laughing.
I want to see a movie.
The accident happened two hours ago.
That is plastic.
I think you'll find it.
Luckily the door was open.
I'll bring it to you.
He will be in time for the train.
I know most of those people pretty well.
"Newspapers, television, and radio are called the mass media."
Tom loved us both.
I was thinking about you.
I hope I'm doing the right thing.
I was hoping you'd know.
Could you gift wrap it?
My mother says I'm very handsome.
Today's Tom's birthday.
Everyone was drunk.
I could make you something to eat.
Listen carefully and do exactly what I tell you.
Did Tom tell you that he'd be late?
Why didn't you take Tom?
Children need to play.
Please walk more slowly.
So you do believe me?
Is that your wife?
Tom tapped me on the shoulder.
He came first.
What time did Tom leave?
I never drink coffee with milk.
Are you sure Tom can eat peanuts?
Would you mind if I catch some sleep?
Didn't you know Tom had an accident?
We're all single.
I told Tom not to tell Mary about that.
Tom said that everything was fine.
He has recently made remarkable progress in English.
"Tom is right, isn't he?"
Tom immediately called an ambulance.
Do you trust anyone?
What's your favorite thing to do?
I was thirty at that time.
I'm finished.
You'd better have a good excuse.
I don't know how I've offended you.
A horrible thing happened here.
I'm tired of your comments.
Tom went by himself.
One of us will have to go.
I'm not done yet.
Ask Tom where he put his keys.
I must find a way to help you.
"You like chess, don't you?"
Don't tell anybody about our plan.
You could've waited longer.
Tom has no desire to go to the movies.
I'm all for your plan.
Tom told me not to open the envelope until my birthday.
I'm reading it.
He is licensed as a pharmacist.
I hope to see my parents tomorrow.
I knew I shouldn't have said anything.
I'm half your age.
Is it still raining?
I wish you hadn't told Tom that I knew how to do that.
They all knew you.
Tom will be in Australia for the next three weeks.
How long are you planning on staying?
"It's not that easy, is it?"
I suppose you're right.
I was busy cooking.
I hope that that happens.
I wish I had a friend like you.
Winter will be over soon.
What are you working on now?
Smoking is bad for you.
That's rubbish.
Good parents are the best teachers.
I am pretty sure.
There's something I want to say.
I got up quickly.
Try to stay dry.
You're both wrong.
Are you sure that Tom wasn't the one who did that?
Don't talk that way.
I know Tom is OK.
Tom noticed a big difference in power between his old four-cylinder car and his new six-cylinder one.
I forget where I put my keys.
I'm sure you don't want to go.
I hate chess.
"Somebody, open this door, please."
"You don't know what this is, do you?"
We're short on time.
The dog is in the backyard.
I don't believe in that.
When will Tom leave for Boston?
It scared me to death.
Tom met Mary a year ago.
A war is an awful thing.
"Pass me the wine, please."
Bring that here.
This river is deep enough to swim in.
I was really depressed.
Have you ever failed an exam?
I can't stand the cold.
I know you want to be happy.
Tom told Mary he wouldn't do it again.
You're lucky to be alive.
I've botched things up so bad I wish I could find a hole to climb into.
Why did Tom change?
I wanted to tell you.
How did you convince Tom to help you?
Thanks anyway.
Tom is boiling eggs in the kitchen.
French is a language.
We've got to find Tom.
What'll you give Tom for Christmas?
What do women want?
How about telling me what you have in mind?
Tom seemed like a very nice man.
I can meet you at 2:30.
We need to get you to a hospital.
I still can't believe it.
There's somebody waiting for you.
Tom is supposed to be here on Monday.
Tom asked Mary why she was so scared.
I've missed you so much.
Who does this dictionary belong to?
That was excellent.
Were you born in Boston?
Tom was bitten by a dog when he was thirteen.
Did you have fun with Tom?
Tom asked me if I would be free tomorrow.
I apologized to Tom.
You still haven't answered me.
He is not as fat as he was.
Throw it there.
Poets write poems.
Tom's fat.
I have to admit I was worried about it.
It is he who is to blame for the accident.
Playing tennis is fun.
This is a coffee cup made in England.
You're good at doing that.
The dog ran after a fox.
She likes no one and no one likes her.
"Next time, I'll do it myself."
When will this end?
Let Tom answer.
The room is covered with dust.
Let's get you to the hospital.
Do you want some aspirin?
Tom had no job at that time.
They are going.
Tom told me he was surprised.
I like both.
"A few minutes after he finished his work, he went to bed."
Tom pulled Mary out of the mud.
It happened twice.
Let me go!
Tom rarely talks about his work.
You weren't ready.
Tom found the article interesting.
You're not going.
Didn't you know that would happen?
What is your plan?
His words surprised me.
Don't be a chicken.
Tom is very important.
"In Japan, school starts in April."
Tom's computer is broken.
We're ready when you are.
Tom has lost both of his parents.
I've always wanted to travel through Europe.
How well do you know Boston?
I need to leave at 2:30.
"This is your chance, Tom."
What sort of man is Tom?
I will never have a son.
Today is my birthday.
How many times have I told you not to mention Tom's name around me?
How boring!
She was painfully thin.
It is a mystery how they escaped from prison.
Please shuffle the cards carefully.
Tom took a sip of his tea.
"Hey, get off my bike."
Tom is a teetotaler.
Count up to thirty.
He did not like her manner of speech.
It's time for lunch.
Tom said he didn't know you.
They burned the captured supplies.
Tom likes cats.
Tom followed me.
Tom is eager to go there.
I'm not that fast.
He went to Paris two years ago.
I didn't even get an invitation.
No one believed that.
She didn't want him to leave the room.
Tom is the blackmailer.
There's a lot you don't know about me.
Tom's mother and sister had breast cancer.
I also like to listen to music.
Has anyone seen Tom?
The soldiers are wearing iron helmets.
"So, are you seeing anyone?"
He is thick-headed.
Did you find anything?
"Excuse me, but I didn't order this."
We walked through thick bushes.
I thought that you knew that.
I told you not to move.
We have to get these people out of here.
Blow out all the candles on the birthday cake at once.
I didn't ask Tom any questions.
You don't have to eat.
I absolutely love this song.
Tom and Mary are still best friends.
I'll just wait outside.
We arrived first.
I'd like to stay one more night. Is that possible?
Which newspaper do you work for?
Tom didn't say how many times he had been there.
Burn the body.
Tom was fined for not wearing a seatbelt.
Tom is a fluent French speaker.
We were very disappointed with the results.
How did Tom pay for all this?
It's time to go to bed. Turn off the radio.
I have decided to retire.
Which one is ours?
Tom called three days ago.
Tom said that he was worn out.
It costs an arm and a leg.
Who do you think will win the tennis title this year?
He ran five miles.
I don't know what I would've done if you hadn't come to help me.
"Who are you? ""I'm Tom."""
Tom needs a haircut.
I have good kids.
Tom isn't much of an artist.
Tom has been a widower for three years.
Tom asked for your help.
Tom rarely smiles anymore.
Many birds fly south for the winter.
Who is the plaintiff in this trial?
How did you become blind?
"Tom told you I wanted to talk to you, right?"
I work with your son.
Tom made coffee.
He watched her making a doll.
We're not going to change anything.
Tom gave Mary sound advice.
Tom tried to call for help.
Tom waited in his car across the street from the bank.
You look pretty young.
My shoes squeak.
I'm as scared as you are.
I have children.
Ask Tom what his sister's name is.
Tom didn't see anybody.
The air is fresh in the morning.
You have a way with women.
I don't yet know how many days I'm going to be here.
Where will you be this time tomorrow?
Tom switched the lamp off.
I've got a toothache.
Did you forget to feed the dog?
How many times has Tom been arrested?
Tom isn't smiling.
Did she say that?
That place is creepy.
Are they worth it?
We are all eager to see the movie.
Tom said that he wanted answers.
You're almost right.
Tom isn't going to die.
I plan to give my son a computer at the end of the month.
I know that he is a famous musician.
See you there.
I'll wait at the bus stop.
Be careful not to step in the mud puddle.
The fight resulted in several arrests.
I have to admit that you're right.
Tom is asleep on the bench.
Tom told me that he was disappointed.
Someone left you a message.
Tom didn't know Mary didn't know how to speak French.
Are you angry at him?
Nobody could tell me why that happened.
I remember everything you tell me.
It was even better than I had imagined.
Tom didn't have a bicycle when he was growing up.
You live too far away.
Can somebody help?
Did you and Tom discuss a price?
Tom said there was nobody in here.
"If you don't mind, I'd like to be alone for a while."
You should have listened to me.
Tom's horse reared suddenly and threw him.
That's why you're still single.
It's just a baby.
I want you to promise me that.
It was late at night when we got back.
Are dragons real?
Didn't you know Tom was dating Mary?
Tom makes three times more money than Mary does.
Tom will be back in a second.
I can't go back to Boston.
Is Tom always so helpful?
I think that's rat poison.
Don't shout.
I'll work as long as I live.
Tom was a taxi driver for three years.
I wish I hadn't argued with Tom.
Is it hard for you to do this?
I like this job.
Tom might get fired.
I accidentally did that.
These politicians are corrupt.
This tree is older than I am.
"Tom likes Mary. ""I think that's obvious to everyone."""
You didn't trust me.
Everyone knows you're rich.
I thought that you said you lived in Boston.
Have you already called Tom?
What made Tom cry?
He is proud of having won the prize.
This book is very thick.
It's pretty cold.
It's fall now.
It's beautiful here.
Tom has hardly any close friends.
Why didn't you just call?
Please call me.
Tom died on October 20th.
What did Tom buy Mary for Christmas?
You're my new assistant.
Mary went back to using her maiden name.
Are you sure Tom is going to win?
His son's name is Tom.
Tom and Mary don't want to sing together.
I checked Tom's pulse.
He's wearing a white cotton shirt.
Why didn't you tell me?
I have to finish what I started.
I really enjoyed it.
Where will you go?
Tom wondered who Mary was waiting for.
Her mother has made her what she is.
We told Tom not to stay out late.
Birds are chirping.
Tom told me you despised Mary.
That reminds me of you.
I don't like to think about it.
I'll ask you one last time.
She died before I arrived there.
Something is going on here.
Tom was carried off the field on a stretcher.
Tom may wear anything he wants to.
"I told them to use parentheses, not brackets."
Tom hopes Mary doesn't win.
Tom thinks that I'm stupid.
Tom helped Mary pack her suitcase.
I'm interested in buying it.
I don't think that Tom told Mary the truth.
Tom isn't going to wait for me.
I thought that you looked sad.
Tom is waiting for you to say something.
Is that enough for you?
Tom and Mary are both very hungry.
Someone set fire to the house.
"Take it away, please."
Tom had to wait.
Thanks for coming.
I have two dogs. One is white and the other black.
What do you like most about Tom?
Do you have any idea who did this?
Thank you for the gift.
Tom has a beautiful garden.
This wine tastes good.
No way!
I love that song.
Tom told me to go buy some bread.
Aren't you even a little curious?
I agree with you.
Tom likes to travel alone.
Tom looked into the room and saw that nobody was there.
I thought I heard someone knocking on the door.
Tom has been saying mean things about you.
Tom is getting rid of his old furniture.
The policeman told me that the last bus leaves at ten.
American generals believed they could win an easy victory.
What did you expect me to do?
We're looking for a place to eat.
How did you manage to convince Tom?
We're fighting against time.
Call a doctor.
Are you sure you don't want to move to Boston?
Who wouldn't be happy here?
It cost a lot of money to repair the car.
Where does your grandmother live?
I'd go visit Tom in the hospital if I were you.
"Actually, we've already met."
Tom always lies to me.
Stay still.
It's too high.
I'm afraid to go alone.
Do you want me to hate you?
Can I buy you a cup of coffee?
I've been waiting for the right time to tell you.
When will Tom be here?
Sunlight can heat water.
I've always liked you.
Have you seen him before?
I'm too young to go to school.
Tom doesn't want to wait that long.
Did you tell Tom?
Tom likes the way you cook.
Did you go out last night?
"In the U.S., you usually have to show identification in order to buy alcohol."
Tom has a nice laugh.
My brother is not satisfied with his new car.
I cooked supper last night.
How well do you know Tom?
She mentioned my name in her book.
What are you doing Sunday?
How can you be so blind?
Let's wait for the rain to stop.
I took two aspirins for my headache.
Don't let Tom use my bicycle.
Do you really not get it?
We didn't know which bus to take.
Tom wasn't surprised that Mary already knew about what had happened.
I went to the hospital to see my mother.
I'm quite poor.
I'll leave when Tom gets here.
Tom respects his elders.
No one suspected you.
I hope you don't mind.
Tom handed in a blank test paper.
Tom didn't sleep.
Who do you think it was?
I don't want to know all your old boyfriends' names.
What's everybody laughing about?
I've seen it a million times.
Tom enjoyed playing baseball.
You don't have to answer all of the questions.
Tom hates his name.
Tom wouldn't let me help Mary.
That flag is very beautiful.
Everyone knows we're rich.
"I didn't go, but stayed at home."
I didn't come here to apologize.
I'm seriously considering moving to Boston.
"Just don't tell anyone, OK?"
Tom has gone out.
They say that Mary was a great singer when she was young.
Tom knows that he can win.
Do you want my help?
I don't dare talk to her.
Were you able to convince Tom?
I'm not allowed to speak to Tom.
Tom is staying with us.
I don't want onion soup.
The financial situation is getting worse week by week.
Don't open the door.
I won't die.
I was hoping to surprise you.
Tom is probably going to agree.
He stuck the notice on the board with tacks.
There's nothing worse than loneliness.
Where are your gloves?
It's actually a good idea.
Is there a book store in the hotel?
Tom abandoned Mary.
Those are extenuating circumstances.
You know me well.
"My mother went shopping, didn't she?"
Are you sure that man is a doctor?
Tom and Mary are going to go.
"Although she was tired, she tried to finish the work."
"You know, I had a lot of fun."
The Great Lakes supply drinking water.
Some men treat women like property.
Will you teach me how to play chess?
"May I speak to Tom, please?"
I never noticed before that you're taller than me.
What should I feed my dog?
We waited in the park for a long time.
Germany and Japan were defeated.
Perhaps he knows this story.
I felt that.
Tom got wet to the skin and caught cold.
I think Tom is scared.
My parents wouldn't understand.
Don't worry. Someone will come and rescue us eventually.
They were collecting information.
Do you think it'll rain this afternoon?
Get lost!
Tom carefully lifted the lid.
Tom said he wanted to show what he'd made to Mary.
You just need help.
That would be a wise decision.
They have gotten lazy.
Where is the most beautiful place in the world?
Do you know that girl's name?
Is that edible?
Tom dropped in to see us.
I don't know how this works.
There are too many things here to fit into this suitcase.
Do you really want to know why Tom doesn't like you?
Forget what I said.
The boy was searching for the lost key.
We need a little more time.
I want you to stay here longer.
Tom is good at mathematics.
He punished his children.
We did that together.
I don't want to drink anything cold.
Tom isn't fazed.
I want to speak to you about Tom.
Call your wife.
I know that Tom is thirsty.
Tom won't attend today's meeting.
"You're drunk. ""No, I'm not."""
"Here, have a taste."
This is your captain speaking.
The teacher has a great influence on his pupils.
The food is spoiled.
Tom took Mary's money.
"If you keep doing what you're doing, you'll end up in jail."
"This is my friend, Tom."
I don't want to read it.
How is your family?
I'm just shy.
Tom said Mary didn't look well.
Tom lived in Boston until 2013.
Leave it up to me. I'll take care of everything.
Maybe I'll call you.
Don't you remember what you said?
I still don't understand why that happened.
Can I have another one?
Why don't you go to bed?
Don't expect too much of him.
You're not a loser.
Tom told me to do it.
I'm observant.
I never made such a promise.
I finished first.
What time does it close?
Haven't you ever done this before?
Tom has bought a house in Boston.
You're bleeding again.
Don't go there alone.
I didn't know Tom knew about that.
Tom wanted Mary to be safe.
Tom isn't talkative.
What are you proposing?
I don't think it's going to rain today.
What're you going to be when you grow up?
Tom hoped to visit Boston.
How beautiful this flower is!
Let's just get this over with.
Tom wasn't jealous.
You shouldn't look down on those who are less fortunate than you are.
Tom held Mary tight.
Tom lived in a small apartment by himself.
Tom claimed he wasn't afraid.
You have three options.
What did you change?
Why are you looking at me like that?
Are you ready to fly?
It's going to take at least three hours.
Tom got up at 7:00.
Do you think I could do that?
Let go of my arm! I can't stand people touching me.
He is shaking like a leaf.
About how much money do you need?
The mayor's office is in the city hall.
Everyone wanted Tom to have fun.
Tom's phone is ringing.
Tom put his notebook away.
I could do it again.
I think you know where we need to go.
I don't think we have any choice.
Tom is going home.
We forgot all about you.
I'm not going to sing that song anymore.
My house is dirty.
This is their problem.
The Colombian government demanded more money.
He speaks English and French.
We'll always remember Tom.
Who are you going to vote for?
Tom told Mary to go home.
Close that drawer.
I thought you liked me.
The most important thing is not to give up.
Would you like for me to do that for you?
Tom seems to have lost his key.
I heard that Tom attempted suicide.
It was true.
She must have been sick.
How will you be spending your weekend?
Tom knew that Mary was asleep.
That was a costly mistake.
I've only done that one time.
I know I've been acting strangely.
You're not Canadian.
I was aware of everything that was going on.
What's the point?
Why haven't you done your homework yet?
Go get some sleep.
Tom's not feeling very well.
There's no way to save everybody.
She did not disappoint him.
Does Tom want something?
Everyone is looking at me.
Tom is learning French.
Close the window before you leave.
I just didn't feel like getting up.
It'll be easy for Tom to do that.
There are many birds in this forest.
What'll Tom do tomorrow morning?
He is the tallest in his class.
I thought that you had a date.
They don't sell what you need here.
The police are looking for both of us.
I'm sorry to call you so late at night.
I was selfish.
Tom won't make it.
You must come back before it gets dark.
I told Tom I wanted to go with him.
This is bad news.
Tom didn't believe Mary for a second.
The island was struck by the typhoon.
Why did Tom accuse you?
I nodded.
I think you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
Tom asked me why I didn't ask anyone for help.
I study French every day.
I don't see what's changed.
Is that why you called?
Tom has to come with me.
I'm the same age as you.
Tom and I are in trouble.
Chinese and Japanese are very difficult languages to read.
Make sure you tell Tom.
A fly does not fly into a shut mouth.
Tom heard that Mary got a job.
Are you satisfied with your life?
Tom wants to sit in the front.
I'm sure you'll like your new job.
You're naive.
I wish that you hadn't seen me doing that.
Tom lived in Boston for three years.
I also have doubts about that.
I think that was the problem.
He works for a large American corporation.
We don't have lots of time.
Tom handed Mary a glass.
He's doing a handstand.
They've been at sea for the past three weeks.
That's just what he needs.
Tom isn't as old as I thought he was.
I just want to cry.
Tom is not a criminal.
I understood what you meant.
The IRS is auditing me.
Who turned off the lights?
I knew you were against it.
He was scolded by his teacher for being lazy.
Tom didn't believe us.
Tom asked if he could do that.
They roped off part of the street.
I can't believe Tom is still single.
Tom has gone completely mad.
You have little to gain and much to lose.
Do you think Tom is ready?
The car holds five people.
Give me back my bag.
Please open the bottle.
Tell Tom which one to take.
The family lived in poverty.
You have to do it again.
You must not smoke.
I didn't know Tom was your husband.
I know I shouldn't have asked you to do that.
I lost my passport in Australia.
I called Tom from Boston.
Do I look fat in this dress?
I suspected that Tom wouldn't be able to win.
"You were jealous, weren't you?"
I was born in Osaka in 1977.
What's new in your neck of the woods?
Tom put his shirt on backwards.
Iron is used in building ships.
Kabuki is an old Japanese art.
He's younger than me.
She's not a bad girl.
Eat everything.
"He can't tell a cherry tree from a plum tree, but he can name them in twelve languages."
My jeans shrank in the wash.
I'm going blind.
Tom has a dual personality.
I don't think it's a trick.
Tom met Mary on the way home from where he worked part-time after school.
Have they responded?
They will go there with me.
I can teach you how to translate.
Can we use this?
Don't tempt me.
This fruit doesn't taste good.
I just took a bath.
It was easy.
Don't get mad at me.
I'm pretty sure that Tom has never been to Boston.
It is no exaggeration to say that he is a first-rate writer.
I know that Tom is a genius.
"In front of the university, there are some bookstores."
Where does Tom work?
Did Tom tell you how he met Mary?
It's in your bag.
Tom and I soon became friends.
Tom asked me to tell you something.
This custom should be done away with.
You should on no condition touch these instruments.
I visited the village he was born in.
Tom is unimaginative.
Tom is hated by everyone.
She seems to have found a boyfriend.
How did you solve the problem?
I didn't know how to reach Tom.
I take it that means yes.
Stop gambling.
I can't go with you tonight.
My friend helped me.
I wish you were here with me now.
She broke the window on purpose.
Tom drove Mary all over the place.
Many could not hear him.

My neighbor's name is Tom.

I should've quit smoking a long time ago.
I have no plans at all.
What'll I tell Tom?
We have to be more careful.
Do you think they noticed?
We saw some houses in the distance.
Is the milk good?
Tom and I aren't strangers.
I don't think anyone suspected you weren't Tom.
She studies English every day.
We should've phoned ahead and reserved a table.
We're playing tennis this weekend.
Why didn't you ask me?
Tom stopped playing.
Tom took these pictures last summer.
Tom said that Mary would call.
Trees are planted along the street.
I remember something.
Did Tom ask you why you did that?
I respect you for what you have done.
I would like to have some more tea.
What'll you do then?
Tom rarely talks about himself.

This is a picture of the happy couple on their wedding day.
Can I speak to you?
I know French.
I didn't have to go with Tom.
"Are you sad? ""No. Why would I be?"""
That's why I'm giving it to you.
Tom stole money from his roommate.
You must study more.
You look good for your age.
Nobody lives here.
Tom said he needed our help.
I'll stay right here till you get back.
I realize that Tom wasn't joking.
Tom is a family man.
"He doesn't want to talk to me now, and I don't know why."
Tom doesn't like the way Mary treats him.
Please answer me.
Tom should be in school.
I thought everybody knew.
Give me a chance to prove it to you.
How do I get there?
He got up in the morning.
Our meeting was quite accidental.
How can we do this?
You're dreaming.
What makes you think Tom will listen to you?
I don't think that Tom will swim tomorrow.
I wish you had told me the truth.
Tom probably doesn't know where Mary lives.
You look like death.
Has Tom told you what happened?
We have a lot to discuss.
The manager offered to show me around the plant.
It looks like we fell into a trap.
What's all the hurry?
Tom decided not to move to Boston.
I have never fed my dog a banana.
Can we ask you a couple of questions?
How's your leg?
Why don't you take your coat off?
I want you to teach Tom how to drive.
I still don't know how it happened.
I bought this for my boyfriend.
We hung up the laundry together.

Tom died in October last year.
Which should I bring?
Don't give me any hints.
He never did his work anyhow.
Tom really likes you.
Why are you home?
Tom is getting married this autumn.
Get out of there immediately.
It rained yesterday.
I had not expected Tom to be at the meeting.
What's all that?
Tom is young and strong.
Do you think Tom will be careful?
Tom must've already done that.
I'm afraid I don't know.
Why do you want a dog?
I hope Tom will come.
What is that in front of us?
Tom stayed with Mary until the ambulance came.
I think you can easily do that.
I'll tell Tom myself.
We never go to bed before midnight.

I don't really understand your question.
I promise you I'll explain everything later.
The food's ready.
I didn't see their faces.
Tom is a really good person.
Tom won't want to do that for you.
This bag is too heavy.
Tom might understand French.
Tom's first wife died in 2013.
Please don't kill me.
I wonder if you need to do that.
This is a very tall tree.
Can you hear the frogs croaking?
I shouldn't be telling you this.
Am I the only one who agrees with you?
Tom quietly knocked on the door.
I have so much work to do that I have to put off my trip.
Tom was nearly hit by a car.
He lives in Nagasaki.
I wasn't sure.
I don't need to know why Tom doesn't want to do that.
I started going to the gym.
"If I'd wanted your advice, I would've asked for it."
I read your book.
I must meet Tom.
Look away.
Don't you want your children to learn French?
You should give up drinking and smoking.
I love them both.
Thank you for this.
Tom and I won't do that.
I remember this photo.
You're unpredictable.
I don't think I'll be able to fix it.
Tom told everyone Mary was adopted.
He died from overwork.
It's time you told Tom the truth.
She's older than him.
I think I'll be busy this week.
"Even if it rains, I'll do that tomorrow."
Did you change the filter?
Tom wanted revenge.
Please tell me it's not true.
Bookmark this site.
I'm faster than you are.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
"Everyone wants me to go, but I don't feel like going."
What've you lost?

It's getting cold in here. Let's close the windows?
I scarcely think so.
Tom has a couple of bank accounts Mary doesn't know about.
I heard you talking.
Tom didn't have to say anything.
Tom asked Mary not to talk to John again.
They consider him unfit for the job.
Tom refused to listen to me.
Did you come here alone?
Tom found the leak and fixed it.
Don't fail to call me tomorrow.
Why did you eat that?
Tom hates it when people keep him waiting.
It is not necessary for us to attend the meeting.
He kept reading a book.
Tom doesn't know much about Indonesia.
It's the only logical explanation.
Tell me who else knows about this.

I need to say goodbye.
It happened so fast.
Tom was the last to find out about it.
"You're right, as always."
I promise that you won't be disappointed.
You're too young to go to school.
What are your conclusions?
She talks a lot.
Don't take everything so seriously.
"Where's your cousin? ""He just left."""
He was a great influence on me.
Tom is growing a beard.
Tom showed me the way.
Let me show you something.
Maybe you're too young.
They're all older than you.
Tom didn't want to tell me what had happened.
Set this aside for me.
"If that happens, I'll be very glad."
Are you going to eat your dessert?
I don't speak French as often as I used to.
We don't want any freeloaders around here.
Tom's awkward around women.
Tom came back three months later.
Don't be naive.
I hate doing things like this.
I can't answer that question.
The meat was very tough.
You've arrived too early.
Don't say that word.
How did you end up here in the first place?
I love the way you say my name.
Didn't you know Tom had a sports car?
Come here at exactly six o'clock.
"It tastes very good, doesn't it?"
I'd like to live in New York.
Tom walked back into the house.
Let's take a walk.
Wait here.
You're a weird kid.
I don't think I could stand to spend six hours alone with you.
I was about to say something.
Why don't you want to swim today?
I suspect that Tom is bluffing.
Somebody came to our house.
Tom is always in a bad mood.
It will clear up soon.

The talisman he's wearing is supposed to ward off evil spirits.
Tom apologized to me.
Mary wears expensive jewelry.
Why do you have to go to Tom's?
I have to fix a mistake.
Don't smoke so much.
It was a smart choice.
This room is quiet.
Do whatever you want about it.
I'd never allow that to happen.
Everyone says the same thing.
I was Tom's teacher.
"It's my problem, not yours."
She looked at me and laughed.
That topic is worth discussing.
I'll take it up with Tom.
Mary is a natural blonde.
Tom was sleeping.
No one believed us.
I felt sure this would happen.
You're the most beautiful woman in the world.
Today is the twentieth of October.
I'm always the last to know.
He complained that he couldn't find a job.
I said I was tired.

It was stupid. We never should've done it.

I like chicken.
Tom cries a lot.
Try to eat a little more.

Do you come here every day?
I don't think either of us wants that to happen.

I've got to go to the bank.
I had to shoot my horse because he was in a lot of pain.
Tom says he wants to speak to you.
That tie looks good on you.
"Don't get me wrong, Tom."
Tom has helped me countless times.
"You just don't get it, Tom."
I wish it were already summer vacation.
You can't buy happiness.
Tom needs to be told to do that.

I told Tom we're friends.
The police started to look into the murder case.
You don't even know where Tom is.
I believe that story.
I think Tom is mistaken.
"He thinks he is somebody, but really he is nobody."
I've heard about all your problems.
You may leave if you want to.
Tom was arrested by mistake.
I don't know why Tom didn't do that.
Tom got drunk again last night.
Tom's father is dead.
Is there a bank around here?
You don't know me.
They don't like you.
We must tear down this house.
Tom will likely be present.
I know better than to do such a thing.
Tom won't have to go there anymore.
They became angry.
Benjamin Franklin was an American politician and inventor.

I wonder what Tom would do.
I really do need to speak with you.
We did everything right.
I borrowed three books from the library.
Do you really want to help Tom?
Do you really do that?
Tom and Mary are almost the same age.
Why is everybody so sad?
I advised Tom not to go out after dark.
He is an honest man and will always remain so.
Please tell me a ghost story.
Don't forget your umbrella.
Tom took Mary home.
Tom is bleeding again.
Tom promised that he wouldn't be late anymore.
There was a large harvest of peaches last year.
He will survive.
It costs 2 euros.
"His novels are, for the most part, very boring."
Tom isn't going to wait for us.
Clean up the room.
Tom needs it.
I doubt Tom is still there.
The bay has more yachts than sailboats.
It'll be dark in a few hours.
I am thinking of nothing but you.
There was no doubt in my mind that Tom knew the answer.
"Don't think twice about it, Tom."
I didn't tell Tom why I didn't want him to go to Boston with me.
What do they do here?
I just don't agree with you.
Do you feel like eating something?
There's no need to advertise a good wine.
Where were you the night that Tom was murdered?
You've drunk too much.
Tom decided to keep a diary.
My friends don't play tennis.
I looked in the trunk.
Is that black bag yours?
All the names are listed in alphabetical order.
I don't have a pencil.
It makes my hair stand on end.
They went away.
It's nice to see you haven't changed.
Were you sick?
I doubt Tom knew that Mary was already married.
Follow me and I will show you the way.
I have to leave early today.
I'll get the car.
Tom is probably still crying.
Please feed the cat.
The Internet is now something we can't live without.
Tom will see Mary today.
Children need love.
He's a party animal.
Tom kept calling Mary.
Will you help me with this?
I have sand in my shoe.
Tom will do that if Mary wants him to.
I don't even have a house.
You may have to wait.
I want Tom left alone.
They say she's good at cooking.
I don't have time to help you now.
We all agreed unanimously.
I didn't notice it.
Tom is acting as though nothing has happened.
Tom is a very hardworking person.
Don't miss this amazing opportunity.
You've done something wrong.
Tom put bait on the hook.
I don't remember ever meeting you before.
How small is it?
What's the color of Tom's hair?
Tom has never been in love before.
I need to hire somebody who can speak French.
Have you finished your French homework yet?
The guy with a beard is Tom.
Tom will kill all of you.
You only have to read a few more pages.
We now know that was a lie.
You're a beautiful woman.
She introduced me to her father.
Bring me the flute.
I might as well do it now.
Tom doesn't study hard enough.
Are you feeling OK?
She has brought up five children.
It's a fact.
Are you sure Tom wants to do that?
It's not such a big problem. You're worrying way too much.
Call me as soon as you find Tom.
I retired.
Do you get up early in the morning?
I saw flashes of lightning in the distance.
Am I handsome or not?
We said nothing.
When did you last see Tom?
I wrote that.
What do you think of the new teacher?
We're not lying to you.
Tom is leaving for Boston tomorrow.
Could you turn it down?
You can count on Tom.
I don't like this.
Such behavior shouldn't be permitted.
I want to have my name taken off the list.
Tom called me from Boston.
I wonder where that ship is headed.
You're lucky you didn't die.
Her suggestion is worth considering.
"Tom wanted to kill Mary, but John stopped him."
Who cut the cake?
Can you tell what I need to do?
Where can I wash my hands?
You've done nothing wrong.
Tom walked inside.
Why doesn't Tom like me?
I think it's time for me to change jobs.
Who in their right mind would do such a thing?
Send me a new catalog.
You seem tired.
What time do you usually return home?
Will you report everything truthfully?
I've got to run.
I'd be happy if you'd help me.
Did you sleep OK?
Who's your favorite race car driver?
Keep dancing.
How many cars do you have?
Who knows where Tom went?
I'm tired of doing this.
It's really windy today.
Tom started coughing.
Tom is watching TV right now.
I got a new computer for my birthday.
I probably should've asked Tom that question.
The flashlight won't turn on.
I'm texting Tom.
Who are you and what do you want?
What happened yesterday?
The accident created a traffic jam.
Did you see any planes today?
Aren't both Tom and Mary from Boston?
That's considered a sin.
I don't know anything about the future.
I'm closing my store.
I'm going to be a lawyer.
The students listened patiently to the teacher.
We're rich.
You shouldn't get married.
How much longer must I do this?
I wanted to tell you how sorry I am.
I would like you to stay with me.
I don't know anything about Tom's life.
Why doesn't Tom know that?
Would you please speak a little quieter?
Give me some money.
Tom says that he's feeling a lot better.
Now I'm sad.
Get the kid to bed.
Everyone looks happy.
"I worked hard all day, so I was very tired."
I'm sure you'll make the right choice.
They don't like me.
No sooner had I left the house than it started to rain.
I plan to return to Boston.
I'm sure Tom will help you.
You should be proud of what you've accomplished.
Will you keep your promise?
I don't remember seeing you before.
He doesn't have to know.
I want you to stay.
Her name wasn't on the list.
How did you know where Tom was?
What did Tom buy from you?
Tom didn't ask Mary not to do that.
"After weeks of working flat out on the project, Tom can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel."
I can't protect you.
I just want you to be happy.
That's under discussion.
We need this.
I hope you can help us.
No one is permitted to enter this building.
Do you have anything planned for tomorrow?
That's what Tom does to those he doesn't like.
Tom is getting ready for school.
They intended to increase the military budget.
Tom was embarrassed when his parrot came out with a string of obscenities in front of Mary's mother.
We don't really care.
Symptoms vary.
He came to like her.
There's the problem.
"Oh, no! We're running out of gas."
This is my father's house.
Hi.
Tom bought himself one.
Why do you have only two cars?
Did you manage to get something to eat?
What do you use this for?
Don't you feel happy and relaxed?
They say that he was very poor when he was young.
Tom was nice to Mary.
I think I may sneeze.
Do you have to go now?
Tom was homeless.
Didn't you know that Tom saw you in the park this morning?
"If I could've prevented this, I would've."
Please don't open the window.
I would've never done this.
"If you want to stay, you can stay."
What did Tom reply?
It took me several hours to write it.
See you at the reception.
None of us did what Tom wanted us to do.
He rose from his seat.
What's that restaurant's name?
I'm not going to do anything about that.
Tom grabbed Mary by the throat and choked her.
Tom is one of Mary's friends.
Tom asked Mary to stay for dinner.
He leaves for school at seven.
Tom's forehead touched mine.
Do that once more.
Wine is made from grape juice.
Does Tom know about this report?
I never thought they would accept me.
I remember when I first saw you.
I became acquainted with your father yesterday.
Tom got his hair cut.
Studying is important.
"I can't afford to buy a used car, much less a new car."
Tom was a very nice man.
Tom doesn't want to discuss this.
I'm feeling better already.
I don't know when he got back from France.
I'd like to return a car.
Let's play house.
Tom now makes millions.
The man reading a newspaper is his father.
Tom got burned.
Can you suggest a better idea?
Tom is a very capable player.
Get Tom some water.
Tom is the only friend Mary has.
Tom is married and has a daughter.
Tom tried in vain to please Mary.
I want you to go home.
I heard my dog panting.
I made a U-turn.
We're a good team.
How beautiful this flower is!
How could you do that to Tom?
Tom scolded Mary for not arriving on time.
I kept digging.
I always carry it in my pocket.
They're not bad.
Have you fired Tom?
I didn't know that you used to work here.
Where did you find it?
You have a bright future.
Tom apologized again.
I'd like to stay for one night.
"If you tell me the truth, I'll forgive you."
I can't excuse what I did.
Tom wrote a lot of poems.
"If you're happy, I'm happy."
The winner was Tom.
I think it was Tom who helped Mary.
I'll never be forgiven.
I'll go right now.
You watch too much TV.
Tom would stay if he could.
It is likely to rain again.
Tom's waiting.
Tom thinks that he can save the world.
Do you know Tom personally?
The church is decorated with flowers for the wedding.
I know that you're the one who did that.
I've never seen you cry.
Do you happen to know what happened?
I'm already retired.
Tom signed for something.
Tom is a bit younger than me.
Please promise me you'll never lie again.
Tom isn't Mary's boyfriend anymore.
Tom gathered wood for the fire.
Tom drank from the tap.
I don't know what to buy him for his birthday.
Tom has his reasons.
Tom doesn't want children.
Texas is nearly twice as large as Japan.
I'll have to do that.
Were you afraid the first time you were on an airplane?
I'm the boss.
I'm glad the kids weren't hurt.
They'll kill you.
I went to Boston alone.
Tom isn't that young.
I must talk to you.
"For instance, what would you have done if you were in my place?"
I should be with Tom.
How much longer do we have to wait?
Do you want me to leave a light on for you?
Why do you always wear that hat?
It was nothing but coincidence.
I don't want it now.
I can't tell you why she was absent from school.
Tom doesn't seem to recognize Mary.
This story is true.
Call your brother.
My initials are on my briefcase.
They know about it.
Don't you want to know how I did that?
How old are you?
Tom told Mary to be punctual.
"We don't have a lot of money, but we have enough to buy what we absolutely need."
I wasn't strong enough.
Read it to me.
Tom fought bravely.
He believes that he can prove it.
What were you doing in that cave?
You're going to lose.
I guess that you can't do it.
All of us plan to be there.
I couldn't hear what you said.
The sniper is driving a white van.
Tom was asked not to speak at the meeting.
Go away. I don't want to see you.
I knew you wouldn't abandon me.
I wouldn't have agreed to do that if I'd know how much time it was going to take.
Tom likes playing with my dog.
I think I'm right.
You don't stand a chance.
Tell me why you're upset.
Tom and Mary are broke.
Tom is dangerous.
You need the rest.
I can't live without her.
I'm doing everything I can to help Tom.
I seldom go to Boston.
Tom drinks very little.
I'm always willing to help you.
This chair is broken.
I never worked with Tom.
You must go on a diet because you are too fat.
Stop! Thief!
You didn't have to leave.
"This is, strictly speaking, a mistake."
My husband is the jealous type.
Don't drink so much beer.
Tom stayed late.
I'm wasted.
I have three times as much money as you.
Do you know Latin?
He lives in Tokyo.
Anything you say can and will be used against you.
I'm very sorry I voted for Tom.
But his name is slightly familiar to me.
Tom called everybody.
Tom still doesn't know who's going to be there.
That was very important.
I know what makes me happy.
The cost of the painting is very high.
Tom went either to Boston or to Chicago.
Tom and Mary seem scared.
Tom said that he couldn't do anything.
I know what Tom likes.
It's safer there.
Tom still goes to school.
You're a very generous person.
I think you have made a mistake.
That was a new experience for me.
Tom believed everything Mary said.
I'd do that again if I had the chance.
They're everywhere.
Is there a problem here?
"In addition to a thick fog, there was a heavy swell."
I have no idea what that could be.
Tom will keep us informed.
It's stopped snowing.
I'm much younger than Tom is.
Tom explained how the system worked.
This tree is about 300 years old.
I was the last one to know.
It's happened before.
What should we talk about?
Tom got here ten minutes ago.
Have I disappointed you?
I have one question for you.
This is what Tom gave me.
My uncle lives next to the school.
Humans are the only living creatures that make use of fire.
He will be angry to learn that she told a lie.
I wasn't even sure you knew it.
Why does it matter to us?
Put that back.
This is all there is.
Tom himself sewed on the button that had come off.
Tom said that he was busy.
Call me if there's any change.
Can you talk to Tom?
I'll always remember you.
Even my mom knows it.
She decided to take legal advice.
It's in your hands.
It seems Tom's in love with me.
Tom doesn't know anything about it.
Tom worries about his weight.
I know the girl you were talking to yesterday.
I gave them each an apple.
Prepare for combat.
It's sunny here.
I thought you were already dead.
I went to visit my grandfather's grave today.
Tom knew that he was unlikely to be elected.
What makes you so sad?
I have a wife and children.
This looks interesting.
English is taught in most countries.
It was a beautiful place.
Tom admitted killing Mary.
This is a message for Tom.
Could you help us after school?
You're being very unfriendly.
Here's a brief outline of my speech.
I don't remember your name.
Don't throw away this magazine.
I need to know what happened to Tom.
"Tom, there's something you should know about me."
Do you still think I can't do it?
She was seen at a restaurant with her lover.
I mistook you for my brother.
Tom hasn't told me anything about you.
You have no evidence.
"I don't know if you've noticed or not, but Tom hasn't been getting to work on time recently."
Keep them away from Tom.
Hold it!
I wish you hadn't told me.
He believed that blacks could win their fight for equal rights without violence.
I didn't want to see anyone.
Do you honestly think Tom would do that?
No one has the right to tell me who I can and can't love.
I actually did say that.
Fill the bucket with water.
That's never going to happen.
I don't think I need Tom's permission to do that.
I'm sure they're on their way.
I'm not too tired.
I can reschedule.
Tom is the one who feeds the dog.
Is this chair Tom's?
How long is this bridge?
Nobody knows.
I wonder why that happened.
I'm against it.
All the prisoners escaped.
"I didn't want Tom to go, but he went anyway."
Didn't he tell you anything else?
I'm wearing a warm pair of socks.
Tom says he hates cleaning his room.
Tom is calling from Australia.
He made a journey around the world.
That was the last time Tom was seen alive.
He was a burden to his parents.
Do whatever you like.
Take a look in there.
I don't know what Tom thought.
Did you really do this all by yourself?
I don't know why that was happening.
That looks good on you.
I'll phone you.
Why are you so hard on yourself?
Tom looked at the clock on the wall.
They decided to leave the bullet where it was.
I drank too much and was unsteady on my feet.
How could I have known?
The batteries are dead.
Tom didn't know you were joking.
He always takes sides with her.
I heard that Tom used to live in Boston.
I don't believe in luck.
I thought I had enough money.
Tom is always watching television.
Tom's dog barks at everyone.
He thought that he was a genius.
I found it on the street.
Tom needs to come back to Australia.
He needed to rest.
Who wrote this report?
Do you ever rest?
I asked the doctor some questions.
Why do you hate us?
Tom didn't tell Mary what his last name was.
Tom messed up everything.
Don't you know Tom?
The room was a complete mess.
Tom didn't know what to do.
Tom found Mary a taxi.
We have the right to bear arms.
Parents need a lot of patience.
I'm writing a letter to my daughter.
Who's your lawyer?
I'll fix you something to eat while you take a shower.
All of them wanted to know my secret.
He escaped from prison.
Are you busy Friday night?
I offered to help.
Thank you for your invitation.
Don't say anything to anyone.
I held on to the rope tightly so I wouldn't fall.
Do you like sweet tea?
Tom put an arm around Mary.
Tom usually eats fish two or three times a week.
I sat next to a man on the airplane who snored the whole time.
Everybody dies.
Leave the door open.
I just need to find Tom.
Tom is Mary's current husband.
He is capable of teaching French.
I wasn't very late.
You remind me of someone I used to know.
"If you're hungry, have something to eat."
The building was completely destroyed.
They have to repair their car.
I think that there's somebody in here.
The fence will be painted by Tom tomorrow.
Tom left the band in 2013.
Tom always ignores my advice.
Goodbye!
Tom won't go to school next week.
I wouldn't blame Tom.
There's a distinct difference between them.
Banks open at nine o'clock.
Tom looks as though he might start crying.
Is there an ATM nearby?
We all chipped in to buy our teacher a birthday present.
I sing almost every day.
I love to party.
Tom wants to know what Mary is doing in Boston.
Tom himself told me this story.
Tom is driving without a license.
The vote is unanimous.
I'm incredibly tired.
Tom told me he wasn't sick anymore.
"What about me do you like? ""Everything."""
Warm and humid weather increases the number of crimes.
Why don't I go with you?
Did you believe Tom?
"From the practical point of view, there are many shortcomings in his plan."
You aren't superstitious by any chance?
Tom won't object.
I did what had to do.
How do you know that that isn't true?
You can use my dictionary.
Tom's eating.
I was the only one who laughed.
This is part of my job.
I added your name to the list.
"First, I want you to apologize to Tom."
Which search engine do you use?
This is illegal.
My job is just as important to me as your job is to you.
Can I do it again?
I don't want you following me.
We have to avoid the nuclear war by all means.
I'm glad to hear you're better.
Tom neglected his cough and got bronchitis.
Tom doesn't eat meat and neither does Mary.
Tom said he'd be back on October 20th.
This is a lot more fun than studying.
The boy sitting over there is Tom.
We've both seen it.
I don't want to know the truth.
We thought that would be enough.
He'll never forgive me.
You have my word.
We own a dog and a cat.
There are people who don't like to go to bed early.
Our native language is Japanese.
Did that happen recently?
You can't stay in here all day.
How did the photo session go?
You don't want to do this.
I want to hear from Tom.
Stand by.
My hobby is visiting old temples.
May I take a nap on your couch?
Tom helped the police catch the thief.
The princess was beautiful beyond description.
He returned home without telling us.
I didn't want to miss anything.
It began to rain five minutes after I left home.
It was sunny this morning.
Nobody cares what you think.
Didn't you know about this?
Their habitat is threatened by deforestation.
Don't forget to feed your dog.
Is this a bad time?
Tom constantly checks his phone.
The world is changing.
She is busy right now and she can't speak with you.
I never want to talk to you again.
I don't know where Tom went.
Tom told me to tell you that he appreciates everything you've done for him.
I knew Tom would want to do that.
Tom talked to me for a solid hour.
"What's wrong, Tom?"
Tom looks old.
Do you have what I asked for?
Where did you study?
"I'm sorry, I don't understand what you're saying."
That's completely unfair.
I'm glad you invited me.
I heard everything you said.
Do you think Tom and Mary are married?
He is an active person.
Life is full of surprises.
My sister has become a good pianist.
I bought a new dress.
Tom and I often sit next to each other on the bus.
I let my friend copy my homework.
I knew I'd find you here.
Look at it.
I'll show you the way to the station.
It's difficult to explain.
Tom said he knew what Mary was planning on doing.
Tom waited for Mary to answer.
I think that there are a lot of good-looking men in Australia.
We are likely to get there before dark.
Can you sit up?
How much more money do you need?
Tom broke into Mary's apartment.
"You're about my age, I think."
Tom wasn't the only person who was arrested.
The weather was so cold that the lake froze over.
The new telescope was shipped in a huge wooden box.
Don't open the box yet.
The train was derailed by a piece of iron on the track.
You've been very kind to me.
We didn't see anybody.
Are you actually going to do that?
His lie complicated matters.
I know you'll have a lot of fun.
Tom hoped that Mary wouldn't find out.
Tom asked me to wake him up at 2:30.
Could I have a piece of cheesecake?
Do you think I'm stupid or something?
I am never at home on Sundays.
How do you find time for everything?
I thought Tom would try to help us.
I'll work alone.
Tom is sure.
See you there.
It's disgusting.
Who's your friend?
Which way did you choose?
I won't do anything.
Who discovered America?
I was still asleep when Tom left this morning.
Do you want to help me?
Please tell me how much you paid for that.
I eat breakfast every day.
I used to live near Tom.
Why doesn't he tell them?
Tom slowly walked backwards.
That's your problem.
Were you aware Tom was having financial problems?
We know where it is.
I just got lucky.
I used to love telling jokes.
Tom took off his coat.
I called Tom and told him about my problem.
"I'm not as old as you, of course."
Try to make a good impression.
I'm going to blow your head off.
"Sorry, I don't think I can do that."
Tom died happy.
Let's have a party for Tom.
Tom said he didn't know any French.
You must break the vicious circle.
I'm getting undressed.
I'll tell you more.
We wanted to listen.
Those are too big.
That I can't tell you.
I don't care about the money.
Would you mind if I look around?
I'm not the only one who knows your secret.
Is it cancer?
Don't look down on poor people.
Tom had to go.
You just sat there and did nothing.
Aren't you over eighteen years old?
I'm unemployed.
This magnet is very powerful.
I was just going to ask you the same question.
Someone sent me a gift.
I asked her out on a date.
I don't want to buy a yacht.
I told you I'm not ready.
Are you relaxed?
You're the most beautiful girl in the world.
Please lower you voice.
He died of cancer.
Tom became angry again.
Who got shot?
When was the last time you grilled meat?
Tom sat alone.
We have almost no water left.
Tom was paid three hundred dollars for doing that.
I didn't know why Tom was sad.
I shouldn't have lied to you.
Let's do it now.
I saw him cross the road.
Tom put his hat on and went outside.
"If not for yourself, then do it for me."
How much does that lamp cost?
I'd have waited for you.
He drove to school.
We're working as fast as we can.
She's been poisoned.
How do you know which one is yours?
I like Boston a lot.
Tom has been to Australia more times than Mary.
That's how I know.
What did you do with that money?
The picture is hung upside down.
Mary is a remarkable girl.
She promised to marry him.
Tom was very boring.
We worked together.
I didn't need you.
I'll send Tom a postcard.
I don't care who you are.
We'll talk to Tom.
Some people caught rats and ate them.
Aren't you in town?
Why are you staring at me?
Tom sold Mary his car.
I had to go there by myself.
I no longer need your help.
Can I at least hug you?
"You're a bad boy, aren't you?"
Both of them are aware of what has happened.
You should follow the doctor's advice.
I don't like being made a fool of.
I need space.
You've had plenty of chances.
The number of tickets was limited.
Tom didn't want us to come.
I admit that I was wrong.
I don't know what Tom does.
"Tom, are you downstairs?"
"You don't smoke, do you?"
"I'm not very good at this. ""Neither am I."""
"We don't have white roses, only red and pink."
"Tom usually wakes up at about six-thirty, but he doesn't usually get out of bed until seven."
How many people live in your town?
That professor is an authority on Shakespeare.
You are doing very well. Keep it up.
Let me have a word with Tom.
Of course you can trust me. Have I ever given you a bum steer before?
Tom doesn't like reading.
Tom is older than Mary's father.
What else will you need?
"Stop it, please."
Why didn't someone help you?
I'll go with Tom.
Please move back.
Tom joined Mary and the others.
Did Tom say something to you?
Tom is too busy to see you at present.
Where did the other girls go?
Tom can't yet tie his own shoes.
You can help.
I never thought Tom would want to go with us.
I'm not a bachelor anymore.
"Had it not been for your help, I couldn't have done it."
His reply was logical.
That's just the point.
All men are equal.
Have you had dinner?
Tom blamed everything on me.
I already know how to drive.
Tom said you couldn't come.
Tom lost his job because the firm decided that a robot could do his job better.
I usually sit in the back.
What did you drink last night?
Everyone laughed at me.
We have visitors.
We don't know how much time we'll have.
I want to eat fried rice.
Tom failed.
Today I have to drop by the supermarket.
Tom was mugged.
Who's Tom living with?
I have few friends.
Tom says he can pay for it.
He worked from morning till evening.
"Even though it was raining, we decided to take a walk."
Tom doesn't drink coffee very often.
She heard him sing his favorite song.
They didn't see it.
Someone left you a message.
Selling cars is my job.
Don't expect anything to change.
You'll be arrested.
We went into the woods in search of insects.
Why do you come here?
Don't forget to give Tom some money.
Tom told me to think for myself.
"He has two daughters, both of whom are married to doctors."
Have you ever seen Tom eat?
We'll all miss you when you're gone.
I don't want Tom to talk to Mary.
Didn't you know that I wanted to do that?
Tom didn't want to do something he would regret.
It's really not that hot.
I really miss my wife.
Only God knows.
What in the world is going on?
I'd like to see the agreement.
Is there enough gravy?
I don't think I know the answer to that question.
Are you really going to let Tom do that?
Do your homework right away.
Smoking is bad for your health.
How much should I pay today?
I need a cold shower.
Both of them can speak French.
I traveled around Europe.
Hunger can make people do stupid things.
"Tom is now in Australia, isn't he?"
I'm glad to hear Tom wasn't injured.
I am tired because I had to study for this exam last night.
Tom isn't responding.
I don't know if I can do this.
That happens a lot here.
Tom hasn't been charged yet.
Tom was like a brother to me.
I've lost your phone number.
Did you take back the books?
Tom doesn't like the way Mary talks to his children.
Have I disappointed you?
Give me those.
Tom almost got fired.
I've seen this movie before.
Do you believe in UFOs?
You almost hit me.
Give my regards to Tom.
Aren't we going?
Tom waited in his car across the street from the bank.
Where is the police station?
We'll arrive tomorrow.
Tom has some good news.
I wash my hands before eating lunch.
Tom bought a newspaper.
"Just by looking at your face, I know that you have good news."
Tom recently got out of prison.
Turn the volume up.
I accidentally deleted everything.
The policeman put handcuffs on Tom.
Tom can't understand why Mary is mad at him.
I didn't want to alarm you.
It's been unusually warm this week.
I plan to return.
I'm not Tom's mother.
We need a little time alone.
I will never see him again.
It's too far to walk.
Tom was reading a letter written in French.
Do you need the key?
Many people would agree with you.
Tom stepped on the rake.
I am busy now and can't play with you.
I hope I don't get lost.
I think I was the one who suggested that.
I caught five fish yesterday.
Close your book.
Tom should've left when he had the chance.
You're mean.
Let's talk about what you did in Boston.
Tom was fired after being late three times.
It's not free.
Didn't you know Tom could do that?
I don't want to live in Australia for more than three years.
That's too much!
You're not young.
Would you care for more cookies?
I am tired and I want to go to bed.
My mother appears young for her age.
In Japan a new school year starts in April.
I'm just being careful.
Tom didn't find it.
I still can't believe Tom has gone.
This old house is haunted.
Tom is a con man.
This movie is highly controversial.
I really like this album.
White carpets are very hard to keep clean.
Everyone is responsible for his own actions.
Don't be such a cheapskate.
You don't take anything with you when you die.
Do you have the book?
The work is actually finished.
How could you want that?
Salesmen are usually fast talkers.
Don't let your feelings show.
Tom asked if he could speak to the manager.
Where did Tom get this phone?
You'll get lost.
The news made him happy.
I dream a lot.
I thought you didn't want anything to eat.
My wife wants to adopt a child.
I'm glad we already have so much in common.
I'd like to eat now.
Tom didn't offer us anything to eat.
I was going to tell Tom about you.
You've got to find out what happened to Tom.
How much ice cream do you want?
The news of his death spread.
I miss you a lot.
I'll bring it on Monday.
Could you tell me how to get to the station?
I don't have a home.
He was there on business.
Why is Tom unhappy?
What time does your next class begin?
Tom knew he'd have to wait.
Tom won't stay long.
Let's not waste time talking about things we can't change.
I totally agree.
Give me a sign.
I saw how Tom did it.
Tom told Mary to keep that a secret.
I'd like a glass of water.
We had an earthquake last night.
Great thoughts come from the heart.
You're mine now.
Look at this large map of America.
I tried to stop Tom.
And then what happened?
I was so homesick.
Do any of you need medical assistance?
Next year my birthday will fall on a Sunday.
They were told to stay on the ship.
Didn't you know that Tom would be there?
Tom is much more relaxed when Mary isn't around.
I love my kids.
I'd really like to know why Tom isn't here today.
I have a feeling Tom is lying.
You really just don't get it.
"I've always loved you, Tom."
You have no heart.
Soon you'll know everything.
I live in a rooming house.
Tom read the letter slowly.
Did you bring a towel?
I'm glad that you're glad.
Tom didn't scream.
Tom couldn't see the lake from where he was standing.
How do we fix it?
I didn't know you wouldn't do that.
I didn't have to go.
Tom has gone fishing.
She earns half as much money as her husband.
I wasn't conscious of anyone watching me.
I've been asked to leave.
Can you tell me whose books these are?
I am an honest person.
You're always wearing the same clothes.
Have you told your mother?
I don't think anyone knows yet.
I'm hungry because I haven't had lunch.
Didn't you know Tom was going to go fishing with Mary?
My father used to say that money is not everything.
The doors are locked.
Drive cautiously.
"If Tom hadn't been sick, I'm sure he'd have gone with you."
I'm a girl.
Tom is too old for Mary.
They left the room one by one.
We just have to find Tom before the police do.
I've already told you more than I should've.
We're going to find out who did that.
The roof is really in need of repair.
Don't forget us.
Have you finished writing the report?
Please don't quote me.
Have a drink with me.
I'd like to ask Tom about that myself.
No one knows her name.
They're smiling at each other.
Everybody knew Tom.
We stayed behind to help Tom.
I think it's a serious problem.
His house is near the subway station.
I want to go get my hair cut.
Tom isn't in the hospital.
Where can I mail these letters?
Tom has decided to go to Boston next weekend.
Tom clapped.
I want to show you something.
I won't go to school.
Everything happened the way Tom predicted it would.
I see a book.
Your mom is here.
Who's your favorite figure skater?
Can you drive?
Do you really think Tom is crazy?
You'll be very happy here.
"I don't want to talk to you, Tom."
Thank you for all you've done.
Tom slipped Mary a note.
I know you're not serious.
I doubt that Tom will lie to you.
Tom says that he won't do that.
That's a very bad idea.
Either you or I'll have to do that.
Tom apologized to me this morning.
That makes more sense.
Tom got up just before dawn this morning.
I think that this is right.
I spent last summer at my uncle's.
What's in the closet?
Are you busy tomorrow afternoon?
I wish that I could run faster.
Do you know where my key is?
How did you know I didn't like Tom?
They won't help us.
I don't know which is which.
I'll come by 10.
Please don't ask me to do that.
I used to read a lot more than I do now.
Everybody knows everybody.
Why are the police here?
I finally understand what you're saying.
My aunt died an old spinster.
I can't cook well.
Tom didn't arrive until it was already too late.
Please show me that one.
Do you think that plants feel pain?
They're very pretty.
I will tell you about him.
She fell down the ladder.
He never gets invited to parties.
You promised me that you would take care of them.
Tom said that he was surprised.
We have a lot of things in common.
Tom said he'd walk Mary home.
I'm waiting in line.
Water is needed urgently.
Three men stood guard.
Have you decoded it?
Tom passed by.
You have nothing to fear anymore.
I know you're afraid of snakes.
I don't want to give you false hope.
That ended better than I expected.
The money is at your disposal.
Have you ever known them to come on time?
Wait a second.
Tom and Mary love each other madly.
Do you know who Tom is?
You must keep your room tidy.
It rained heavily.
I didn't catch the meaning.
He speaks two languages besides English.
Tom has made a lot of new friends.
I've met so many new people.
I don't want Tom to think anything's wrong.
I want you to bring Tom.
Tom's thirty.
He sprained his ankle.
Why is it such a big deal?
Tom brought me something to drink.
Tom explained what happened.
That's impossible.
How's your morning been?
I've never seen you before in my life.
We need to talk face to face.
How many languages are there in the world?
I can't believe you really want to leave.
Why were you helping Tom?
Tom doesn't like cops.
The train passed by us.
Is Tom fat?
Why do you know so much about Tom?
Take a book from the shelf.
"I didn't want to go, but I did."
I was really depressed.
Tom is probably just making a mountain out of a molehill again.
Tom is a world-famous conductor.
That distinction was well-deserved.
A squid has ten legs.
There's very little activity around here on Sundays.
There are discrepancies.
I saw him do it.
I'm not sure I want Tom working for us.
"Tom is young, but he knows what he's doing."
Tom will come when he's ready.
When does Tom need it?
We've got something for you.
Were you told to do so?
Don't interrupt me while I am talking.
The piano won't go through that door.
Who else could've done it?
I'd like you to help me gather some firewood.
Tom threw the ball to Mary.
Where's the nearest hospital?
It serves you right.
Tom still hasn't taken down his Christmas tree.
Where is the beach?
I don't know anything about cars.
We train together.
I don't like the way you look.
Don't ask me to help you ever again.
Tom is much taller than Mary.
The plane landed without a problem.
There is a pond in the middle of the park.
Tell him to wait.
Did you hear what they said?
True friendships last forever.
Something caught Tom's attention.
I was sound asleep.
Do you study chemistry?
Let's leave at 2:30.
Can I borrow your eraser?
Tom gave Mary what she needed.
Tom told me he wasn't busy.
Tom is a World War II veteran.
I don't feel like doing anything when it's this hot.
It's time for you to go to bed.
She went on a journey a few days ago.
The shop is open from Monday to Saturday.
Just pretend you don't know me.
Do you feel more encouraged now?
Tom and I live near each other.
Do you like this girl?
You still haven't told me what to do.
Do you want some milk?
Tom made it clear that he didn't want to help us.
We've been through a lot.
The apple was eaten by me.
I'm not crazy. You're the one who's crazy.
Thanks for all you've done for me.
Let's not lie to ourselves.
Please come.
Tom said that he'd be right back.
Tom will never let you drive.
I want to please you.
The expensive machine turned out to be of no use.
We've got to be ready in thirty minutes.
I'm too tired to swim.
"Somebody, help me, please."
I've read every book on the shelf.
You should tell Tom he was wrong.
Tom knows it's too late.
He treats me like a child.
Do you know where Tom bought his bicycle?
Let's do it at our own pace without hurrying.
Does Tom always talk this much?
You'll thank me for this someday.
I knew that Tom would be back.
He was involved in the trouble.
You can't make it without me.
You talk so fast I can't understand a word you say.
It's been snowing all night.
When did you start wearing contacts?
Tom was dumbstruck.
Tom has already explained the rules to me.
Can you wait a minute?
Aren't you in town?
I can't afford a new car.
I know that Tom won't be coming.
"According to the weather report, it will snow tonight."
Tom came back at 2:30.
I guess my mind wandered.
Tom can stay at our place.
I will go for a walk if it is nice tomorrow.
We don't want to go to your wedding.
I've already started studying French.
It's in the garage.
Is this one of your creations?
Which is the heavier of the two?
What's your Skype username?
I knew Tom would be awake.
You're my new assistant.
Does Tom have any medical problems?
We have many things in common.
Tom told me I need to go to today's meeting.
I have to return this book to the library.
We saw you come in.
I don't remember you at all.
Tom should've told us the truth.
Why do you even care?
Tom didn't seem to be offended.
Hand me the hammer.
I'd like to buy a dog.
Things like this don't usually happen to me.
Tom knew that he couldn't speak French as well as Mary could.
I can't speak French as well as you can.
He comes home from his trip to Europe tomorrow.
I only know what you tell me.
We just wanted to help you.
I know that Tom is weird.
You're optimistic.
I'm still your boss.
I stopped working for Tom three years ago.
She kept her eyes closed.
Tom is normal.
I swear I didn't see anything.
He gets a haircut once a month.
I never thought I'd see Tom again.
It was hard to believe.
I'll release you.
Stop shooting!
We're all retired.
Did that hotel meet your expectations?
Tom and Mary don't like me.
The cause of the accident is still not clear.
Time and tide wait for no man.
I told you I'm the best.
I'll postpone my trip to Scotland until it's warmer.
"Tom did that on purpose, I think."
You have a message here.
Where did you learn to dance like this?
I have a lot of friends that can speak French well.
I'll bring my sister to the party.
Where do you want to live after you retire?
"That was Tom, wasn't it?"
He was robbed of his youth.
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
I told them they shouldn't move.
The opposition party put forward a bill to reduce income tax.
Am I really ugly?
Tom isn't supposed to be here.
The light is off.
Let's play tennis.
This place has a mysterious atmosphere.
Have I convinced you?
Do you cry often?
I'm very short.
I probably won't be here tomorrow.
I was there when Tom died.
Do you really believe there's a connection?
They went on an expedition to the North Pole.
"Tom is interested in history, so I'll buy him this book for his birthday."
Your horse is beautiful.
Let's go by bus.
This restaurant only accepts cash.
No one uses that word anymore.
Are you playing games with me?
I think it'll rain.
I can't conceive how I could have made such a mistake.
Tom knows how to count to ten already.
"People who will lie for you, will lie to you."
It rained three days on end.
We can't tolerate that kind of behavior.
I had my brother put this room in order.
I knew Tom wouldn't be here.
My children are all in perfect health.
Tom wants to sell his house.
He had an accident at work.
Tom never told me he was engaged.
Why was the door locked?
Are you sure you don't want me to tell Tom?
Is it possible to help Tom?
I don't wear a tie every day.
I'm too short.
They cleared the street of snow.
She used to live in Tel Aviv.
I found the photo you were looking for.
How old will you be next year?
I used to dream about being a millionaire.
Tom was armed with a kitchen knife.
I'll write to Tom again.
Smooth out your dress.
Tom told me that he didn't want to live in Australia.
Did you call an ambulance?
Do I look OK?
You are free to say what you think.
She finished her coffee and asked for another.
I told Tom to leave it alone.
I'm talking about my friend.
I don't want Tom to do that alone.
Tom could barely breathe.
You're not allowed to smoke here.
Stop babbling.
He saved my life.
What do you think of me now?
Keep track of your finances.
Tom was driving the bus.
Take a look at this picture.
I'm the only one in this group who doesn't speak French.
I've had to do everything by myself.
Thousands of people visited the city.
He was afraid of making the first move.
"That is not an orange, either."
Turn off the water.
Is anything broken?
Please read this book.
The cliff is almost vertical.
Get out of here.
That's always a good sign.
Stop shouting.
Why wasn't I notified?
He has to have his blood pressure taken every day.
"There are some things we could've change, but we chose not to."
That sounds fair.
I'd rather do that myself.
When was the last time you stayed at a hotel?
Didn't you know that Tom was planning to go to Australia?
I think that you're being unfair.
You and I both know that that's not going to happen.
I don't think that Tom and Mary are brother and sister.
Don't let Tom frighten you.
"You talked to them, didn't you?"
I can't teach you anything else.
I know that you trust Tom.
You could've seriously hurt yourself yesterday.
Don't blame yourself for what happened.
It's nice and cool today.
It looks like a wedding.
I've been looking for it all morning.
I'm parked around the corner.
Call me if you find Tom.
This picture was taken on Monday.
He never breaks promises.
Tom goes out for a walk every morning.
Don't interrupt me while I'm talking.
You shouldn't believe either of them.
Tom will protect Mary.
I'll give it a go.
Don't ask me such a hard question.
Tom tried to save Mary.
I'm a father now.
Tom probably isn't hungry yet.
I thought you needed the sleep.
Tom left his umbrella on the bus.
Have you spoken to Tom lately?
"Bring me a glass of water, please."
Tom has kissed almost every girl in our class.
Is there something you need?
Could you please wait just couple of minutes?
I used to admire Tom.
We know why.
Please eat as much as you want.
He was sick last week.
They're unlikely to get married.
Tom looked out the door.
I need to see him again.
Tom is just scared.
Tom knew Mary was being sarcastic.
I've been to Boston two times.
You've got to stop this.
Tom pleaded guilty to drunken driving and his driver's license was suspended for six months.
Do you know what Tom said?
Tom wasn't easy to find.
I find you attractive.
Tom has three younger sisters.
He was dropped from the team for using drugs.
Look at the cat on that roof.
Tom wasn't kidding.
Let's go out for a while.
We'll show them.
She had twins.
This is giving me a headache.
It'll be a good day.
I know that you're frustrated.
Tom thought that Mary wanted to quit doing that.
Tom will kill again.
You need a haircut.
Try that one.
There is no denying that she is very efficient.
I don't want to stop.
I have less money than you.
I want to go hunting.
Tom wants to know if you'll be ready by 2:30.
I think that you paid too much for that.
Tom and I have a lot more in common than I thought.
Look at these photos.
Tom will do that again.
I worked here last year.
Let's swim.
I don't believe Tom will win.
I didn't want the money.
I returned home to eat.
I don't quite understand what you're getting at.
Do you really think that Tom likes Mary?
I have no experience.
Which student went out?
Don't make me leave.
Tom wanted to come to Boston.
It'll be Christmas soon.
I'm getting weaker every day.
Tom almost always wears sunglasses.
Tom didn't want Mary to see his painting until it was done.
Tom needed to go back to Australia.
My parents aren't old yet.
Tom got a promotion.
"If you need to borrow some money, let me know."
I'm taking a dance class.
This shouldn't take more than 30 minutes.
I work indoors.
Five thousand dollars is a large sum of money.
Did Tom say he drank that?
Our main office is in Boston.
Tom is going to be here in half an hour.
Let's go to the mall.
It may have happened when Tom was in Boston.
Just put it here.
Tom and Mary have been married three years.
Thanks for the call.
I'm famished.
Tom flipped the channels.
The dog was dead.
I advise you to be punctual.
I just got my textbooks for this semester.
I wonder if Tom will ever be able to do that.
I don't think these ink stains will come off.
Could you tell me what happened here?
I have a lot of friends who can speak French well.
Tom says his blood pressure is very high.
Do you eat pasta?
Tom doesn't doubt that Mary will cry.
"I drink tea, too."
What inspired you to do that?
One of the players was hurt during the game.
I'm no match for Tom.
I'm sure they're on their way.
I've never seen anything so beautiful.
Isn't it time for you to leave?
I spoke as quietly as I could.
I am crazy about golf.
You look nice in that dress.
Buildings are much stronger now than they used to be.
I wanted you to like me.
"Tom would do anything for his sister, Mary."
I don't know whether you are telling the truth or not.
I'll give you another couple of days to think it over.
I'm sorry I said that.
You'd better not laugh.
I need to know somebody cares.
You must ask for permission.
Tom doesn't eat raw fish.
The climate here is milder than that of Tokyo.
Do you still want to go?
I have to climb this mountain.
Tom hugged Mary even tighter.
Where can I buy one of those?
"That's very kind of you, Tom."
I told Tom to ignore it.
I want to swim across the lake.
Tom told me I need to go to today's meeting.
I didn't have any trouble convincing Tom.
Was Tom surprised to see Mary?
We didn't get it.
Tom is my fiancé.
Tom isn't much older than Mary.
When exactly do you want to do that?
Blue is my favorite color.
Have they done it?
Tom woke Mary up at 6:30 as she had asked him to do.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I have no one to talk to.
I speak French to my teachers.
Donkeys are tough animals.
He'll be safe with me.
Tom can speak French a little.
I don't even know what that is.
Didn't you know that Tom was in Australia last year?
I thought that everybody knew.
The little boy was lost in the forest.
Everyone was there.
You're dying.
Japan is a leader in the world's high-tech industry.
Tom told me that you'd win.
I rode home with Tom last night.
I hope you guys are cool with this.
I never would've guessed that.
I'll miss your cooking.
Tom heard some shots.
Why didn't she tell me?
How was it?
Tom says he needs to buy a new computer.
Tom liked Mary very much.
Stop humming.
Tom has cerebral palsy.
Do you want to be famous?
The papers didn't print this story.
Someone has stolen all my money.
They spent the afternoon around the pool.
Could you give me a hand?
I'll quit doing that.
Tom remained single all his life.
Your name isn't familiar to me.
What do you make?
You'll be quite safe here.
I think you know I like you.
I did that voluntarily.
I suggest that you stay away from Tom.
I'm simply planning ahead.
Tom took a seat next to Mary.
I've only been here for a month.
I don't know what Tom is looking for.
I left my address book in my room.
I asked Tom to close the door.
The boy began to cry.
Tom didn't even know it was here.
I regret having said that to him.
We've raised three healthy children.
I cooked dinner for you.
This river is deep enough to swim in.
Tom has a fever.
Tom doesn't want to wait for you.
He wants to come.
Tom hasn't won anything.
Tom can be there in thirty minutes.
I spend a lot of time reading.
This doesn't answer my question.
Tom wasn't there either.
Tom needed cash.
Do you want to spend the rest of your life alone?
You're a bit shorter than I am.
Tom hasn't found it yet.
It isn't snowing anymore.
Didn't you know Tom couldn't speak French?
Tom has a vivid imagination.
I asked the same question again.
Why didn't you just come to me?
This cheese is made from goat's milk.
You're just being paranoid.
When do I get my car back?
You tried.
I read five different magazines each month.
Do you have a red pencil?
War broke out in 1939.
Tom should return soon.
"If you could choose the genes for your children, would you?"
You have to read between the lines.
I'm glad you came.
I have three questions for you.
I wonder why Tom is so worried.
I hope that I can convince you to change your mind.
He built a new house.
Half of what Tom says isn't true.
Who attacked you?
I decided to stay a couple extra days in Australia.
Why should I study French?
Japanese people are fortunate to live in a land with natural hot springs.
You might be the only one who can do that.
They have plenty of money.
We took refuge behind a big tree.
I've heard that most police cars don't have bulletproof glass.
Tom has a small car.
He started going bald quite young.
I forget his name.
Do you think Tom knows what happened?
Are you finished here?
He was talking nonsense.
Do we have enough chairs?
What color is Tom's car?
What's that machine for?
You should've apologized to Tom for being late.
Are you related to Tom?
It started as a hobby.
Tom has a lot of imagination.
When do you eat lunch?
Don't brake suddenly.
We watched a movie.
Tom and Mary seem worried.
We've no time.
I won't let you jump.
Our trip was canceled due to the heavy snow.
You'll probably win.
Tom told Mary he had to talk to her.
"Well, don't you have anything to say?"
He does twenty push-ups every morning.
Tom should have been here by now.
Do you want this job?
Tom told me that he spoke French.
Don't use up all your savings.
Tom will be very proud of you.
How do you feel about it?
"By the way, I have something to tell you."
Tom and Mary want you to talk to John.
Who teaches you French?
Tom decided not to say anything else.
Am I really that bad?
I've heard about what happened.
Tom ordered three pizzas.
"Tom, can I see you a sec?"
When did you read this book?
Tom swims almost as well as Mary.
Do you think that Tom is still drunk?
"She bought him a car, but he didn't have a driver's license so he couldn't drive it anywhere."
It was foggy near the ground.
Men were men in those days.
Are they both the same?
Tom never forgot his roots.
Tom wants to lose weight.
You said you were a doctor.
I wanted to be punctual.
Why is everybody laughing?
What are your orders?
You look like you're upset.
I know we're a little early.
Tom isn't your brother.
This isn't our fault.
Who is it that Tom wants to talk to?
"Not knowing what to do, I asked him for advice."
I have to wait.
Can you take a photo of us?
I take the train to work every day.
"Hey, what's behind your back?"
The meeting started at ten.
Do you want to know what's wrong?
The policeman asked the girls if that car was theirs.
Tom didn't want to leave his house.
They're young.
Does this ring a bell?
It's such a waste of time.
Clean the mirror.
I don't have a crush on Mary.
I want you to stay.
I caught him stealing pears in the orchard.
Has Tom called?
Guess what he told me.
Tom said it was too risky to go there alone.
Tom asked me to tell you.
Where were you when Tom needed help?
Stay here a minute.
Tom walked up to Mary and handed her something.
I'm going to Tom's house to study.
That desk does not fit in this room.
Is this a riddle?
Neither Tom nor Mary has a dog.
I get what you're saying.
Did you bring the book?
That's a question that I can't answer.
Do you want to see my scar?
My situation has changed.
Tom got Mary to laugh.
I'm the tallest one in the class.
"I'm feeling better now, but I sure felt bad this morning."
Please leave this room.
I could never forget that.
I know about Tom.
Tom didn't die.
He is still too young for the job.
Tom knows what Mary intends to do.
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
Tom lost his hearing aid.
Don't lose heart.
I'll take Tom to the zoo if you want me to.
I have lots of other things I want to do.
Maybe we should talk to Tom.
Let Tom help you.
There's something I want to ask you.
He is two years older than you.
Write with a pen.
That could work.
He died the next day.
She hated her husband.
I hear that you are a good tennis player.
I had to climb over the fence.
Tom didn't have the courage to speak to Mary.
Is it clear?
I used to have to help Tom do that.
I always wash new towels before I use them.
"What were you just doing? ""I was talking to Tom."""
I think you're prepared.
Let's not talk about it any more.
Tom has tattoos all over his body.
Do you want children?
I didn't eat any more than usual.
He swore never to trust her again.
She did her best to persuade him.
Tom was brutally murdered.
I believe you'll win.
You have to stay.
I went to the park last Saturday.
You're wanted on the telephone.
Tom has a pen pal in Australia.
I went straight home from work.
I told Tom I'd look after his dog.
I wash my hair about three times a week.
Tom did good work.
Have you read all these books?
I'm not kidding you.
Tom rarely talks to anyone.
Tom wants you to wait for him.
Let him do it alone.
That black bird is not a blackbird.
Where can I pick up my ticket?
I'll give it a whirl.
Are you very hungry?
Put some ice on your ankle to keep the swelling down.
Do you have to go?
How much money did you spend on your car?
Don't open that box yet.
"Unfortunately, it's true."
Now I realize why.
"You've never been to Europe, have you?"
It's amazing that Tom survived.
What's the difference between religion and philosophy?
How awful!
Death is scary.
We were waiting for you.
I want you to dance.
"You still sometimes win, don't you?"
The garden was covered with fallen leaves.
We've got to get you to a hospital.
Communications are down.
We ran away from the dog.
Where is the end of this line?
I have another plan.
Tom was fired because he often showed up late for work.
Can you guess my age?
My father goes to Sydney twice a year on business.
This is the same type of camera as the one I lost.
No one in my family is a musician.
They're still kissing.
I don’t think I'll succeed.
We've discussed this.
It doesn't matter to Tom.
My feet are small compared to yours.
Is that a secret?
I should've gone with you.
How many times a day do you feed your dog?
"We were poor, but we were happy."
I'd like to give you a piece of advice.
Where are you supposed to be?
Tom took a bottle of pills out of his pocket.
They're coming home.
You may have it.
I got up very early today.
It's gradually getting colder.
I have something to discuss with you.
Do you have it yet?
Follow me.
This is a painting.
They believe in God.
Would you like to live in Mumbai?
Tom is busy running an errand for his father.
There's no time for this.
You need a key to open the box.
We'd better have a talk.
Dinosaurs once ruled the earth.
He and I are kindred spirits.
I really like your work.
I don't know anything about art.
They can't kill us.
Hold your positions.
I want you with me now.
"Tom is from Boston, isn't he?"
I got up very early this morning.
Did you know your air conditioner is broken?
I couldn't do anything about it.
Tom is supposed to call around 2:30.
You know what needs to be done.
I like to learn new things.
Tom isn't looking.
Nothing will happen to you as long as you're with me.
Are you really going to eat all that?
I didn't get paid for all the work I did.
I want an apple.
Get well soon.
They cut a hole in the ice and swam in the freezing water.
I suspect Tom won't need to do that anymore.
His brother has been missing for a while now.
The nurse took Tom's temperature.
What kind of clothes do you usually wear?
The driver was the only person on the bus who didn't get injured.
I help Tom.
Tom didn't understand the joke.
Call the fire department!
We can't continue doing this.
I've dreamed of this.
Is it fatal?
I knew you wouldn't have enough time.
He wants her to go away and leave him in peace.
There is nothing to apologize for.
Children are sometimes afraid of the dark.
The world is on the brink of destruction.
I hope the weather will clear up tomorrow.
I need to speak to you.
I know Tom is tired.
Tom has to protect himself.
"Why don't you get married, Tom?"
Have you told anybody else about it?
Please listen very carefully.
I got a job.
I don't know when this photo was taken.
I've already done what you asked me to do.
I helped Tom wash his car.
Why don't you have a boyfriend?
Tom has three minutes to do it.
How do you decorate your house for Christmas?
Tom is in the other truck.
The bus left early.
"You are free to use this car, because I have another one."
We had a good time in the open air.
The girl caught a small fish.
"Yes, we can change."
How does Tom get to school?
You're not going anywhere until your room is clean.
Who'll go to Australia with Tom?
I didn't know you could dance so well.
This time you went too far.
Why isn't Tom playing with us?
I don't want you to go.
Ask Tom if Mary will come with us or not.
There's something I have to tell you.
Is everybody happy now?
Here's the wine list.
I think Tom could help.
I managed to repair my car by myself.
I don't care what Tom says. I'm not going to go.
Read this book.
"Tom helped you, didn't he?"
Tom became editor-in-chief.
I read it in some book.
I can't swim very well yet.
Can I use it?
"According to many religions, adultery is a crime."
Tom has started losing his hair.
We don't have much time left.
He wore a robe over his pajamas.
He presented an argument for the war.
Tom wanted more.
She had a blue dress on at the party yesterday.
I like this dress. It's kind of cute.
You don't have to come see me.
Show yourself.
Listen to Tom.
Will Tom study French next year?
Tom saw Mary yesterday.
I always keep three dictionaries at hand.
Can I leave him a message?
It's cold there even in the summer.
When's the next meeting?
He saw her and blushed.
I can't remember anything about that night.
It's essential that you understand the situation.
Where's the nearest post office?
I'll do what you ask.
I'm a lifeguard.
Did you see Tom in the park?
"At home, we only speak French."
I felt quite relieved after I had said all I wanted to say.
I wonder whether Tom could win.
Tom doesn't even read the newspaper.
This was a bad idea.
Tom says that he's hungry.
My tastes differ greatly from yours.
Did you do that yourself?
It's important that you share your pain.
I lost everything I had.
"Which one do you prefer, this one or that one?"
What's behind the door?
Tom usually comes home after midnight.
Tom isn't a soldier.
I didn't know you wouldn't be there.
My shoelaces came undone.
We've decided to remove Tom from life support.
Maybe you'll get that job.
He is the richest man in town.
Thank you so much for inviting me.
You've slept a long time.
I made a bookcase.
You told me you'd come.
I didn't even know that you had a horse.
"Why are you wet? ""I fell in the water."""
Tom doesn't think that will do any good.
It's the cops!
We must reduce energy demand.
"Let me know where you're staying, OK?"
I don't want to study in Boston.
I was the only one who didn't cry.
This medicine has no side effects.
I think we should do something stupid.
I'm surprised you remember Tom.
Did you take the book back to the library?
I asked Tom what he was eating.
What are you so worried about?
Tom lost his wife a few months ago.
Tom already has a job.
I've seen a lot of good-looking men in Australia.
Do you really think Tom would lie about something like that?
"If there's anything I can do to help, please just ask."
This is a stupid design.
Computers were invented forty years earlier.
Mary promised her mother that she would help her more often.
Tom bought a present for his daughter.
They'll be pleased.
Call me back when you find it.
You haven't lived in Boston as long as I have.
Let's look under the bed.
Tom decided to come.
I've decided to forgive you.
Tom thought it was strange.
She invited us to her birthday party.
I've decided I won't go to Australia tomorrow.
He is in pajamas.
You're my guests.
I can't believe Tom got arrested.
What made you change your mind all of a sudden?
Tom wrapped a towel around his waist.
She is walking.
I clapped my hands.
You're free to leave.
Are you pleased with your new house?
I hardly recognized Tom.
I just didn't want to be there.
Dinner was expensive.
The store was relatively empty.
Why can't I go with you?
I don't know anything about ballet.
I bought two cotton shirts.
"How do you say ""goodbye"" in French?"
They weren't bluffing.
Are you still in college?
I'm pretty sure Tom lives on Park Street.
I'll stay right here until you get back.
Tom ran the marathon in under five hours.
Tom is a football player.
Tom tried doing that once.
Are you still afraid of snakes?
Tom has a tough job.
How did you find out about this?
"I'd be angry, too."
Tom doesn't know how much time it'll take him to do that.
I told Tom to buy that car.
How much time do you spend on homework every day?
Does everybody here speak French?
He's his own boss.
Tom agrees with you.
The cold climate affected his health.
Tom works part-time as a limousine driver.
Do you want to keep it?
"Luckily, Tom didn't break anything."
I almost never eat fish.
Tom lost his temper and hit Mary.
I can't think of a suitable example.
"As soon as he arrived at the airport, he phoned his office."
The restaurant was empty.
Why did you tell Tom I had left?
He was a pioneer in this field.
Please do that now.
"Tom stayed awake all night, thinking of Mary."
I am sorry to cancel the appointment at the last minute.
Tom rarely goes out.
That will buy us some time.
He used to meditate in the morning.
I hate losing.
What're you doing?
Who do you think we are?
I didn't understand a single word.
No way!
The stamp fell off the envelope.
What kind of game are you playing?
I'd like to be a dentist in the future.
"It's your choice, Tom."
The DNA test cleared him of all charges.
I hope they're going to be OK.
I don't particularly want to see the game.
You did it.
I've got to find out what's going on.
Don't worry about such a silly thing.
They knew each other.
Where's the source of this river?
You're fearless.
How many children did you see in the park?
"Can you hold the elevator, please?"
"If I'm not too busy, I'll help you tomorrow."
Let's have some fun.
I thought you could swim.
We know Tom lied to us.
"That may have been true when you were a kid, but it's not true anymore."
You're a good singer.
The clothes Tom wears are made by his mother.
Why didn't you run away?
Please give me a glass of water.
When do you have to leave?
Everyone in her class likes her.
We're going to begin.
Tom lost everything he had.
Will you relieve me while I go downstairs for a minute?
It doesn't matter whether you answer or not.
I can't get out of here.
Tom couldn't get Mary to tell him her phone number.
He ordered them to release the prisoners.
I knew Tom wasn't happy.
What would I do without Tom?
I know what you're probably thinking.
Nobody else got hurt.
Tom has come to help.
I just spoke with your doctor.
Do you see the connection?
Will you pick me up at seven tomorrow morning?
I've got mine.
You're still green.
I wanted to go to the lake.
I let you win.
We can go together.
Tom glared at them.
I think that's a good idea.
Tom doesn't know who he can trust.
The man you just saw is a great musician.
Tom would've made the same decision I'm making if he were in my shoes.
Tom is observing.
You two look busy.
I am to take over my father's business.
You have to let me talk to Tom.
That's what I'm afraid of.
"If possible, I'd like to go home now."
Bring my bags up to my room.
How did you open that box?
I don't like waiting for you.
"Where is your book? ""On the desk."""
I thought you loved me.
Tom told me you were looking for a babysitter.
I suspected that Tom might not have enough money.
He has no sense of direction.
Can you repeat what you said?
The car's antenna is built into the windshield.
Put it on.
You can't fool me with a trick like that.
Are there any objections?
I never said that.
You're the only one to survive the attack.
The gas tank is empty.
I want you to stop.
Lock the office.
He had his hair cut.
Were you here alone?
You're three years younger than Tom.
We have the exclusive right to sell them.
I'd rather tell Tom in person.
Hold the door.
I usually get home before Tom does.
I could hardly tell who was who.
Why are you always so suspicious?
Tom didn't want to leave Australia.
You should stay.
I'm at the hospital.
I'm in love.
Tom pled guilty to all three murders.
Do you think you'll need Tom's help?
Stretch out your arms.
Who destroyed the garden?
He has already gone to bed.
You'd better call Tom.
Are you sure Tom is dead?
Tom is a good football player.
I'm really glad you're here.
Would you mind turning down the radio?
The policeman lifted the box carefully.
"It's your problem, not mine."
You have the right to consult an attorney before speaking to the police.
Are you afraid of mice?
She wrote the book about people she visited.
A leap year has three hundred and sixty-six days.
Tom just wanted to talk.
I have grown out of the habit of reading comics.
It's time to bury the hatchet.
I had no clue what to do.
It shouldn't take more than a few minutes.
This car is good.
I've found Tom.
Weren't you expecting me?
Don't you know her name?
A lot of people work on farms.
Tom never saw Mary.
Why are you so late?
I want you back in one piece.
No one knows who did it.
He denied having been involved in the affair.
Tom might not even be infected.
"If you were in my place, what would you do?"
When did the show finish?
"Tom will be able to win tomorrow, I think."
Tom told me he and Mary had gotten divorced.
"Tom has a lot of money, but not very many friends."
Tom allowed me to go.
You should come.
The man reading a paper over there is my uncle.
I'll never understand why Tom did that.
"If that's what Tom said, then he was lying."
It started raining as soon as we got home.
Be tolerant.
Tom told me you were retired.
My parents don't speak French.
Do you know my father?
I need a translator.
The foreigner spoke Japanese as if it were her mother tongue.
I've never asked Tom about it.
What do you want to do when you grow up?
He turned off all the lights at eleven.
Everybody wants to be loved.
Are you sure you want to work with me?
I'll come alone.
It's too big.
What should I feed my dog?
The meeting was held here.
Tom promised never to do that again.
We aren't getting anywhere.
She loves Tom.
I'm young.
I saw the doctor.
Who am I to second guess him?
I don't look good in jeans.
"If you see a suspicious person, please inform the police."
The dog sniffed the ground.
I agree with both Tom and Mary.
Tom has two choices.
Your question has no answer.
I've suddenly started to gain weight.
That's not healthy.
I've been playing golf for a very long time.
Can you recommend a good play?
"If Tom finds out I told you this, he'll be very angry."
"I don't know where you're from, and neither does he."
I didn't know anything about his plan.
Tom left for work earlier than usual.
I totally understand.
She threatened to tell on me.
Tom married an older woman.
Is today payday?
Is anyone I know going to be there?
I was offended.
"Sorry, but I'm busy."
It's only a placebo.
Six comes before seven.
I don't like the way he speaks.
How can you justify your behavior?
Tom works for a translation agency.
Is that all you have to say?
Can you park here?
I had to wait for Tom pay me the money he owed me before I could pay you back.
Hope is not a strategy.
I don't think that that's Tom's handwriting.
Tom has to go see Mary.
I'll be better tomorrow.
I'm selling my boat.
Why do we fear death?
I knew your brother.
I asked Tom to sign the documents.
Have you ever been to Japan?
I don't think that Tom is here.
I'll try to do that as fast as I can.
It looks like Tom is nervous.
I hate myself.
Do you know where my recipe book is?
I usually eat a big breakfast and a light lunch.
Are you sure that man's name is Tom?
Why did it take so long?
Tom didn't have anyone to play with.
Clip your nails.
He was in good spirits.
Tom follows a strict vegan diet.
I don't think I've seen you before.
I hope Tom is careful.
What can we do to help?
Baseball is different from cricket.
Do you want to ask me some questions?
I'm pretty sure I'll pass the test tomorrow.
I can't afford to buy that.
She is getting older.
Tom isn't going to stop Mary.
"Look, I can explain this."
"I haven't been to Boston, but Tom has."
I can't stay home today.
I hope you're listening.
"I didn't know that you were sick, so I didn't visit you in the hospital."
I love your sense of humor.
They've been arrested.
What did you do with that car?
I grew up in this small town.
Lots of people make that mistake.
Tell me where I can buy a map of Boston.
He picked up a red stone.
Tom cried when his dog died.
He has never asked me any questions.
They want this.
Why aren't you studying?
Tom cut classes again.
Tom has told me everything.
I don't like the way he looks at you.
They already have one.
She isn't at home now.
You don't need to go there if you don't want to.
"According to today's paper, there was a big earthquake in Chile yesterday."
I want you to try and do that.
He is always complaining about his low salary.
When will you give me your answer?
I didn't think you were so old.
We might as well stay here until it stops hailing.
I asked Tom to tell you I wasn't coming.
"Now, it's my turn to laugh."
He fell into the water and drowned.
"Tom couldn't find a decent job in Boston, so he moved to Chicago."
You don't have to do this.
I wasn't drunk.
Tom wanted to make a snowman.
I think Tom didn't understand.
I'm so glad you said that.
How long have you been in prison?
Excuse me. Who are you?
I'm a long way from home.
Don't read my diary.
I asked Tom not to wear his sister's clothes.
I'd like to ask you for some advice.
Vermont is located on the border with Canada.
Is there room in your car for me?
I've got a family.
I'm so tired.
Where was it that you found this key?
Tom and Mary are both in the hospital.
Didn't you know Tom and Mary were John's grandparents?
Tom was like me.
Tom is a very honest guy.
It's a vice.
Everybody's here.
You must help set the table.
Tom is about thirty.
I'm sorry to interrupt you.
The house is clean.
The following day he was found dead in the bedroom.
"Tom knows what you've done, doesn't he?"
I accepted a present from his sister.
Are you telling me you're worried?
I really am getting married.
It could be dangerous to do what Tom is asking us to do.
My father didn't allow me to study in the USA.
Seeing is believing.
Tom told me he'd be back.
No one can do that.
"If I take a hot shower, the mirror in the bathroom fogs up."
I have no time.
I enjoyed working with Tom.
I'll take this.
Batteries are sold separately.
We haven't seen this before.
Tom can't afford a lawyer.
One stayed and the other went away.
He has been to many places.
I was just showering.
We need to talk about how to do it.
I heard laughter in the next room.
Tom heard Mary coming down the stairs.
I'm sure this is exactly what you need.
Tom has been trying to get in touch with you.
You spend too much time in front of your computer.
I should've followed Tom's advice.
How many inches are there in a foot?
She met the man of her dreams.
Get out of my house.
I don't understand why you didn't do that.
A lot has changed since I was a kid.
I'm direct.
I was in New York when it happened.
It's too hot to eat now.
You didn't finish your drink.
Tom was charming.
Did you watch TV last night?
He should have kept his mouth shut.
I thought Tom said he liked this kind of music.
I would've apologized to Tom if I'd thought I needed to.
I was half right.
I knew exactly what I had to do.
Let's have dinner.
That's what we all want.
Tom talked to us.
Hang that picture on the wall.
I'll follow your advice.
May I ask you a few questions?
Let's send Tom a Christmas card this year.
We were all waiting for you.
What does this have to do with me?
Tom is in his office on the phone.
What will we do when she finds us?
Tom wasn't planning on going.
I told Tom you already knew about it.
Tom is faster than me.
"Fortunately, Tom didn't get seriously hurt."
Someone has to tell Tom.
Are you sure you're not busy?
She is busy right now and she can't speak with you.
I still don't understand what you want from me.
Why do you ignore me?
I can't believe you bought this.
You need to sign your name here.
I'll be back at half past six.
"OK, I'll order it."
Tom told me that you were right.
Let's give Tom a lift.
I get along well with my neighbors.
Your resume is impressive.
He shared his soup with me.
You do that too much.
Tom's mother died just one week before Tom graduated from college.
Tom said that he couldn't swim.
We've got it.
It's been a long time since we've done this.
Tom was in my store just this morning.
"I went to her house, but she was not at home."
I hope you're right.
She is far from beautiful.
Don't make a scene.
Do you want me to help you find Tom?
I think that Tom is innocent.
I was born in 1980.
Who are these presents for?
Please send me a reply as soon as you receive this mail.
I don't think Tom is going anywhere.
The boy and the man are drinking water.
I saw her last week.
Nobody offered to help me.
You're doing everything wrong.
Aren't you glad?
Where is my umbrella?
There's nobody there.
Are you sure Tom is OK?
I think Tom knows how to play this game.
Something has happened to the engine.
Didn't you know Tom lived with us?
The police think Tom killed himself.
Is there anyone who can't come tomorrow?
How many are on your team?
You ought to thank him.
I think you know we have to do that today.
Tom often smokes a cigar after lunch.
I knew Tom was planning to do that.
Did anyone see you come in here?
The village has no electricity.
Tom didn't have a place to live.
Was it funny?
He bowed his head.
I brought mine.
He became sad when he found out.
None were wearing seat belts.
The water feels really warm.
I felt attracted to Tom.
I've read both these books.
He received a lot of praise.
What happened to all your money?
Let me guess.
No meal is complete without bread.
What did you make of that?
You've gone too far this time.
You must do it at once.
I had no choice but to accept the offer.
I know it wasn't easy.
Get real.
This is my favorite.
Go milk the cows.
Tom is at home with his parents.
Do you speak my language?
Did you finish your coffee?
Don't let yourself be provoked.
Is that me?
You're going too far.
What's Tom's favorite drink?
Tom added water.
I still feel bad about it.
I can't go to Australia with you.
Tom told Mary not to blame herself for what had happened.
Thank you for helping me translate the report into French.
I don't consider Tom a friend.
She eats nothing but vegetables.
Tom won't want to hear that.
Don't drop this cup.
Tom tried to run.
Tom didn't leave the house.
I'm just trying to help.
That's the other reason I'm here.
Tom isn't much older than me.
Did you come for me?
I thought that the meeting had been canceled.
You shouldn't have called me.
Tom would have told us.
He was nearly hit by the car while crossing the street.
I thought that you had plans.
I've never cared for Tom.
He had no idea why his wife left him.
When was the last time you were in Australia?
What was your net profit last year?
Maybe you should've told Tom the truth.
Why did you hit me?
Tom has probably never been to Boston.
I think Tom will wait for you.
I want everyone to know about what happened.
Where were you born?
I am a man.
It wasn't me that ate the last piece of cake.
He talked to himself.
The roof was damaged by the storm.
That's not my style.
Do you have any plans for tomorrow evening?
I should've done it by myself.
He was satisfied with his new car.
I could've met you at the airport.
He kept on laughing at me.
It's already 2:30 and Tom and Mary aren't here yet.
Tom is the owner of the company.
Don't say it like that.
The medication is working.
"I can't do that, yet."
All of my attempts have failed.
I wonder what made Tom do that.
I'm having a wonderful time here in Boston.
Was there a malfunction?
Tom stuck out his tongue to try and catch snowflakes.
I was humiliated in public.
It makes sense.
I came with my friends.
They accused him of being part of the plot.
Mother approved my plan.
"I might be drunk, but I'm not crazy."
Where did you buy it?
Tom and Mary want to talk with you.
Tom asked if I liked Chinese food.
I haven't been home in a week.
Tom wanted me to tell you he's busy.
"Sometimes I do that, too."
Tom was vague.
I really appreciate you meeting with me.
She came very near to being run over by a car.
"Our stuff got stolen, and we missed our train."
You can believe Tom.
Tom disappeared a year ago.
Tom is also an artist.
You're welcome.
Glasses and dishes were broken.
Why did you stop doing that?
Did you get permission to do that?
Tom has visited Boston.
That's the painter whose picture you want to buy.
We're going to paint the wall.
If only he would marry me!
When did you have time to do all this?
I know that Tom is mistaken.
"This is hard for you, isn't it?"
Tom starts work on Monday.
It's such a shame you're leaving.
I want you to go back.
Three quarters of the members of this club are girls.
I remember both of you.
Tom knows Mary will win.
You should tell him the truth.
"You're kidding, aren't you?"
We're all praying for Tom's recovery.
That's not entirely correct.
I wonder if he loves me.
I'm displeased with your negligence.
Do we have to go to Boston?
I continued working.
I looked for the key.
Check with Tom.
Are your kids still living with you?
Did you say you would go?
I know that you'll have a lot of fun.
Tom committed suicide in 2013.
Even children can read this book.
I want kids.
Stop crying.
We'll all be home in time for dinner.
She invited her friends to dinner.
You can't go home yet.
I didn't talk to anyone about it.
We appreciate the advice.
What I need is another cup of coffee.
"If I have time, I'll drop in."
Tom isn't my type.
He made a grave mistake.
Girls aren't welcome.
Why did you do what you did?
Let's make for that tall tree.
Tom says that rarely happens.
The light is green.
We ran out of gas on our way there.
Tom made a serious error.
Is Tom on duty?
I need to think of my children.
They say love is blind.
Tom didn't tell Mary how much money he'd spent.
Tom takes offence at the slightest thing.
She gets up early.
I want your love.
Tom and his friends played baseball last weekend.
I opened the box and looked inside.
Who is the greatest poet in England?
I don't really want to go to Tom's party.
It takes courage to do such a thing.
Tom married a nurse.
Is there a problem with your hearing?
My goals are modest.
We had a lot of snow last year.
Tom became dizzy.
I didn't get his joke.
Tom sat on the fence.
No one saw a thing.
I know I'm not good at singing.
Tom is ecstatic.
I've never seen such a wonderful sunset.
I was expecting Tom to be here.
Do you have something stronger to drink?
I did as Tom told me.
I thought you understood me.
Tom needs a ladder.
This picture was taken three years ago.
Tom said you'd gone to Boston.
I've already asked Tom not to do that.
Tom said you'd never come.
I could go for some pizza right now.
Tom won't be in time.
One can't survive without money.
I have been married for ten years.
There are many people in the park.
I suppose I was too busy.
Tom confronted Mary.
I told you it was going to be cold here.
She sat on the bench.
I can't do it either.
I think you know where I want to go.
The firemen localized the fire.
What else do you need?
Tom got a bottle of beer out of the fridge.
Tom loves going to the beach.
I lost the hat I bought in Boston.
I talked my boyfriend into buying me a ring.
They are very popular among boys.
Who ate?
"Stand up, Tom."
Don't skip over any details.
Both Tom and I can't speak French.
Don't keep all of your money in one pocket.
Tom dove into the pool.
She wore a white dress.
I heard her singing.
There's something that I want to tell you.
"By the way, I've got to tell you something."
We've got to talk to you.
This is completely useless.
I like skiing.
Tom agreed to work with us.
It's raining here.
You never say you love me.
We're sure you'll be fine.
I don't know how can you stand that guy.
I saw her last week.
That's done.
Why don't you just tell Tom you made a mistake?
I have something important to discuss with you.
Here's some money. Go buy yourself something to eat.
We need to get in touch with Tom.
I hate being photographed.
Buying a new TV won't make you happy.
Tom won't believe it.
Tom wanted to forget about what happened.
My father and I sometimes go fishing together.
I've left my watch at home.
I've decided never to vote again.
Why didn't you come into work yesterday?
Tom and Mary have been arrested.
He studied military history.
Tom is learning.
We were disappointed with the results of the experiment.
Tom cooked supper for us last night.
I thought that you looked sad.
Tom has a nose ring.
You never know when this might come in handy.
I didn't want you to leave me.
What do you want to say?
Tom told me he'd try.
My instructions were clear.
Tom spent his birthday in jail.
I can't believe I kissed you.
Give Tom a second chance.
She's always finding fault with me.
Which brother did you see?
Tom blushed.
Where's your truck?
It was hot and crowded on the bus.
What's wrong with your eyes?
That's only a toy.
They tried.
I'm not sure I can trust you.
The world is full of incompetent doctors.
Tom is always quoting some famous person.
I had scarcely left home when it began to rain.
He came rushing down the stairs.
He still says that he did nothing wrong.
Tom eats a lot more than Mary.
It's my turn to take out the trash.
Did you know Tom couldn't drive?
I thought you'd be ready.
Tom saw a moose.
I'll let Tom know you're here.
I can help Tom do that.
Where can I rent a car?
"Tom Jackson was born in Boston on October 20, 1995."
"Tom is already here, but Mary hasn't gotten here yet."
Tom needs water.
The TV is broken.
Why haven't you told Tom?
Tom was surrounded by the police.
Give me the tickets.
I hope Tom didn't wait too long.
Tom didn't like me.
It had to happen.
We'll regret this.
Have you finished packing yet?
I knew Tom wasn't likely to lose.
"I'm sorry, but you're wrong."
Do you think Tom saw me?
I asked her if she had been to Mexico.
That's something you'll never understand.
Are you looking for a new apartment?
He married an air hostess.
I don't often stay up late at night.
How about another round?
Tom seems clever.
You dropped your pencil.
Tom and I are about the same height.
The policemen fired at the car's tires.
Tom died a natural death.
Tom speaks French better than English.
We're going to make sure of that.
You must go there immediately.
My parents gave me a new computer for my birthday.
You can't defeat Tom without my help.
We'll wait for you near the gate.
Tom and Mary quietly slipped out of the room.
He has a white cat.
Stand where you are!
I noticed the same thing.
Can I ask why this is so important to you?
Give me a blank sheet of paper.
That was our problem.
Is this your opinion?
You didn't give us a chance.
I should've kissed Tom when I had the chance.
Her hat looked funny.
Tom is completely sober.
I left my jacket in the classroom.
These are facts.
Most of the plants died.
"Come on, Tom."
The dog is barking.
Do you mind if I take a day off?
"I tried to help Tom, but I couldn't."
I had never seen so many squirrels in my life.
Maybe we should cancel the meeting.
Has it been fixed yet?
Did I tell you that already?
Do you really think that's going to work?
Tom is an acrobat.
Why don't you ask Tom? He seems to know everything.
"When the bomb exploded, I happened to be there."
Don't ask me to do that.
You ran a red light.
Here we are.
I need envelopes.
I want to go bowling with Tom.
I need a holiday.
We saw nothing.
Did you tell Tom about Mary?
I would be more careful if I were you.
He left after he had lunch.
You'll want to write this down.
She gives him everything he asks for.
I didn't want to see Tom again.
Tom didn't do his homework.
He betrayed his country.
A little bird told me.
I thought that Tom had red hair.
Caffeine is a drug.
Let's not talk about it now.
She met him on the beach.
Tom is a Boston native.
I remember meeting him in Paris.
Tom wants you dead.
Tom began to sing.
I hear a dog barking in the woods.
His mother is an English teacher.
Tell me the name of the ninth month.
There is no schedule.
Did you know that was going to happen?
I didn't know Tom was sleeping.
We look forward to your feedback.
I think Tom deserves that.
I'll call you if anything happens.
Just tell Tom the truth.
Allow me to accompany you.
How many trees are in your orchard?
Neither Tom nor Mary know how to speak French.
Find Tom before he murders someone.
We can't take it.
What do you usually do on Christmas Day?
You cook better than me.
I was just wondering if I could borrow three hundred dollars from you. I can pay you back next Monday.
The summer is over.
Tom isn't a suspect.
Tom was injured.
Give me your shirt.
They fled in all directions.
Do you know where your father went?
"My mother has a driver's license, but she doesn't drive a car."
Do you always do that?
We try to keep our promises.
I already feel relaxed.
Don't touch that book.
Have you finished reading the book?
Are you sure you want me to sell this?
Your dog is still barking at me.
Tom needed help.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
Does it taste good?
How do you like that?
I sat among them.
He raised his arm.
Tom had no hat on.
Thank you for taking the time to talk to us.
They deserve it.
I stopped laughing.
I'm reserved.
Their marriage broke up last year.
Please wait for me.
I could hardly understand him.
I want you to go to Boston with Tom.
I'll visit you every other Monday.
I forgot your number.
Have you measured it?
I wish you had come to see me yesterday.
I'm not mad at Tom.
Keep your mouth shut and your eyes open.
Tom doesn't have a key to the closet.
We're really happy.
That cost us a lot.
You'll have to speak to the clerk about that.
Is that a question?
You'll have to drive.
May I switch on the light?
How many guitar lessons have you had so far?
I made a deal with Tom.
You don't look pleased to see me.
I had a choice.
I hope we survive.
I can't afford $40 for one book!
Find a solution.
That's exactly what I was doing.
You're smart.
Which of you was here first?
I used to play here when I was a kid.
I threw it away.
We don't have enough money.
You're in good company.
Your method is better.
The town fell into ruin.
She has gone out.
Tom looked at Mary and then winked at her.
He should have known better.
I don't feel like I can trust what he says.
"A committee is a group of people who individually can do nothing, but who, as a group, can meet and decide that nothing can be done."
Is that too expensive?
Tom lives here.
I'm not from here.
I went straight to bed.
Tom won't be afraid.
He was sentenced to death by firing squad.
I don't understand how to do it.
I want to see you before you go.
Tom says Mary should resign.
I want you to have this.
How did you find me?
"Actually, I'm not quite sure."
Which ones are Tom's?
Tom is a simple man.
I don't want to do this alone.
She suddenly kissed me.
I agree to help you.
I'm going to do that myself.
I'll try to change.
Tom thinks I'm an idiot.
What have you been doing for the last three hours?
I know that Tom is illiterate.
Tom is going to call you soon.
What an incredible view!
Tell me their names.
I'm not sorry I'm late.
Tom warmed himself by the fire.
Tom told me to be there by 2:30.
My hair is getting long.
I need to go to the drugstore to buy some medicine for Tom.
Tom took some money out of the drawer.
"That happened to us, too."
How many of you live here?
I'd like to buy a washing machine.
Tom can take it.
How many are there in your class?
I thought you wanted a divorce.
We're extremely proud of Tom.
"I think it'll cost you more than 10,000 yen to have this camera fixed."
I don't think that this makes any sense.
I don't know which one I should buy.
Tom is much richer than Mary is.
Tom is in a bad mood today.
Can you pick it up?
Tom said he didn't to want to talk about Mary.
I hope that doesn't happen.
Did you try to listen to her?
You're one of the few friends I have.
Each business is different.
How would you answer this question?
Tom fooled Mary.
This country is rich in natural resources.
Do you have it?
I suspect that Tom isn't likely to do that today.
This dress is too expensive.
Stay here.
This is your wine.
I do hope Tom gets better.

I don't understand the analogy.
He did the right thing.
I spilled some fruit juice on my new shirt.
You're making me waste time.

It's probably a sign.

Tom knows I've been shot.
This is a picture of my sister.
There's something else I want to discuss with you.
The dictionary is on the desk.
"Tom, I want you to meet Mary."
He is always neatly dressed.
I won't mention it again.
Would you rather drink tea or coffee?
Tom did what he thought was right.
Tom has thick blond hair.
I really want to go.
Tom told Mary how old he was.
I plan to live to be a hundred.
Didn't you know that Tom could play the guitar?
Is this the dictionary you're looking for?
That isn't going to help you.
I don't want to walk. Let's take a cab.
I can't tell you why I was late.
Do you want a slice of pizza?

Get me something to eat.
Does your father know about this?
Tom has a southern accent.

Let me guess.
What's your favorite fruit?
I told you that I'd help you.
The bus was almost empty.
Did you finish your coffee?
Head north.
"You drink milk, don't you?"
I've already told Tom how to do that.
Nobody got up.
Do you need any help?
"I'm blind, not deaf."

Summer has come.
The meat is frozen.

Clean up your room.

She was only half alive.
Tom thought Mary would be glad to see him.
He often goes to Tokyo.
You've got to apologize to Tom.

I wonder if you need to do that.
I tried standing on my head.
We can't give you anything.
I'm on my way.
Tom turned off the air conditioning.
Did you take part in the discussion yesterday?
Tom will carry those suitcases for you.
What's the next station?
You aren't wrong.
Tom wasn't able to make Mary laugh.
Tom will do whatever he can.
I don't know if she will come.
Let me tell you something about Boston.
I was going to do it tomorrow.
I didn't know you were so unhappy here.
Tom made a fortune.
"When in Rome, do as the Romans do."
You can do that.
I'd like to sing a song for you that I just wrote.

You keep forgetting to do your homework.
Look at the sports car over there.
I want to be fluent in French.
I am ready to go with you.
I think my plan is better than yours.
What do you hate?
The choice is ours.
I thought the room was empty.
I broke off the engagement.
I was having trouble concentrating.
The next step was to sign the document.
We'll talk to Tom later.
I know that Tom loves you.
Tom's hat blew off.
"I didn't want to go, but Tom made me go."
I didn't know what I was doing.
One day it will happen.
Do you really need help?
You can't ask me to do this.
Tell me where we're going.
Don't take it so seriously.
We can't give you anything.
I don't have time to sleep.
Yesterday I was caught in a shower on my way home.
Tom said that he wasn't going anywhere today.
I wanted to find Tom.
We get the materials from Malaysia.
You are very smart.
I'm sure your father is very proud of you.
It has been ten years since I left Japan.
Have you ever done that before?
Tom is a terrible kisser.
I got caught in the rain and got all wet.
Are you sure you can do this?
Boston is very different from Chicago.

That's absurd.
He has a perfect command of English.
Tom knows a boy who can ride a unicycle.
I didn't know Tom was a dentist.
Tom invited me to his house for dinner.
Go take a walk.
She was seen at a restaurant with her lover.
That's a big loss.
Tom doesn't believe Mary really did that.
It's a time-honored tradition.
He is saving money in order to go to university.
How did you reach such an interesting conclusion?
"If he asks us for help, we'll help him."
What makes you think I don't want to go?
Don't try to understand this.
That's why I was there.
Add it to the list.
Where did you get it?
It might not just be a coincidence.
That was so amazing.
I'm open-minded.
Make me some coffee.
Tom got mad at Mary.
I had an argument with Tom.
Tell me what you gave Tom.
I hope Tom feels better today.
Tom just wanted to get it over and done with as soon as possible.
You knew I was married.
My friend has a large family.
There's no air on the moon.
Tom can't have done it.
Please turn off the TV.
Nobody cares.
Tom has gained a few pounds.
I do this every day.
I can't figure out why you don't like jazz.
Aren't you thirsty?
Tom put his hands on Mary's shoulders.
What kind of books do you like to read?
Why didn't you get married?
I'm kind of scared.
We used to be friends with Tom.
How is your brother?
"Let's not fight, OK?"
Why do you know so much about Australia?
I‘m ironing my handkerchiefs.
I will introduce you to my parents.
It was too muggy for me to get to sleep last night.
Even Tom said something.
You can go first.
That's the least of your problems.
You crossed the line.
I thought you were serious.
I don't trust Tom anymore.
You've been infected.
It's a good thing that you did that.
Tom hardly ever asks questions.
I warned you once.
I know that I'm ready.
Tom and Mary are sitting on the couch.
Tom hanged himself using the belt that Mary had given him.
Tom is wearing a new uniform.
I've heard no complaints from Tom.
Let's talk about it.
Are you coming with me?

Make up your mind once and for all.
How do you think Tom will cope with the situation?
You must rest.
Tom had always wanted to study French and he finally got his chance to.
Tom didn't tell Mary he was leaving.
Come if you can.
I saw an old woman cross the street.
I gave up keeping up with trends.
Tom has grown wheat for many years.
What a beautiful baby!
I was tempted.
Tom is yelling at Mary.
Tom tried to stop it.
I don't want anything else.
Tom and Mary shared a table.
I'll be waiting for you outside.
Some were unwilling to fight.
I recommended you.
I own this store.
Look at the cat that's on that roof.
British people are used to standing in queues.
God created mankind.
What made her do so?
Is that the only reason?
Was that your idea?
"Whose rings are these? ""They are my mother's."""
Somebody tried to kill me.
I can't wait to see you all in Boston.
How do you help someone who doesn't want your help?
The Tokyo Stock Exchange rallied at the end of the day.
"When you're my age, you'll understand."
The shelling continued all day.
One of the prisoners has escaped.
How many apples do you want?
Go away.
You're so modest.
Tom listened to the news calmly.
Go now.
Tom asked Mary to show John how to do that.
This is the bicycle I want.
I like bread more than rice.
I like sports.
What would you suggest?
It was too expensive.
I wish I hadn't asked Tom to teach you how to do that.
Tom didn't have Mary's phone number.
I was quite at a loss for words.
Tom would have told me.
You must be very busy now.
Don't forget to talk to Tom tomorrow.
I'm devastated.
Tom does everything he's told to do.
I want to know why you haven't done that yet.
What are you going to do with them?
What's this stuff?
My mother bought my brother a yellow umbrella.
Your parents know where you are.
You'll be mine.
I want you to light the candle.
How are you feeling tonight?
It'll have to wait till tomorrow.
Nobody cares about me.
It is raining hard.
There's nothing I can tell you.
I would never forgive myself if anything happened to you.
The books which are on that list will be difficult to find in Japan.
Don't look at me that way.
He doesn't believe in God.
Tom is going to like it.
Silence is a very powerful weapon.
Tom is the president.
He gave her a piece of paper.
I learned to drive three months ago.
I like that it's soft.
This came for you.
That's a nice hat.
I'm the middle child of three.
Which one is my cup?
We have to be prepared.
I lied to both of you.
A great responsibility lies on his shoulders.
Paper burns easily.
"He not only speaks French, but he speaks Spanish, too."
I'm pretty sure nobody's going to recognize you.
Tom is by nature an optimist.
They didn't even know how to write their own names.
Tom got killed in a traffic accident.
Tom will call back.
Don't be fresh with me.
Bring your daughter.
Your feet are dirty.
"What do you mean, you don't remember?"
Are you enjoying yourself?
I won't let Tom come in.
I've learned a lot already.
That's undeniable.
I don't need to be told what to do.
Is that seat free?
Didn't you know Tom was in Boston last week?
Why didn't you go to school yesterday?
I know you were just doing your job.
I'm thinking of buying a house on Park Street.
Tom picked up the letter and pocketed it.
When was the last time you sang?
It's not that bad.
Can I help you?
Don't wait up for me.
I am milking my goat.
Why do you always avoid that topic?
I'll miss this place.
We leave tomorrow afternoon.
The house Tom built is wonderful.
We're getting ready for that.
Tom told me he was feeling fine.
The concert is now beginning.
Both Tom and Mary know that that's unlikely to happen.
I really like that dress.
The thick fog prevented the plane from taking off.
Tell me everything right away.
He employs a maid.
Why are you calling Tom names?
Let me know.
"Kites were invented 2,000 years ago."
Are you all mad?
Tom has two sons. Both of them live in Boston.
We've already sent a message to Tom.
Please adjust the television picture.
Don't interrupt me while I'm talking.
Why were you holding his hand?
Tom has an aunt who is in prison.
They don't need me anymore.
Tom is fair.
What does Tom think about that?
He has begun to enjoy country life.
I can't get in.
It seemed like you weren't interested.
Tom saw his former employer at a conference.
Do you see Tom often?
I worked three years as Tom's assistant.
I won't be gone long.
Tom wants me to follow him.
I can understand you.
This is what you wanted.
We'll take what we need.
No one hugged Tom.
How do you like that?
I don't think you can do this.
I thought you understood.
Would you like to learn how to play the guitar?
Who taught you how to play chess?
He squashed my hat flat.
I wish you had come with us.
I heard it might snow.
You're definitely smarter than Tom.
We can still talk to Tom.
Boys are strange sometimes.
"It's possible, isn't it?"
I knew Tom wasn't in Australia.
Do you like anchovies?
I've decided to fire Tom.
I'll need a few things.
Did you ask Tom for money?
Tom handed Mary a pamphlet.
I want to go back there.
She enjoyed herself at the party yesterday.
Men were men back then.
You don't seem very satisfied.
Didn't you know Tom died in Boston?
I don't need anyone anymore.
I'll be extra careful.
I don't think that Tom would be interested.
I feel a lot better today.
I'll cook you dinner.
I haven't done anything yet.
This one's free.
Who's your favorite heavy metal guitarist?
Tom's house burned to the ground.
Are you ready to go home?
What do you eat for breakfast?
Hospitals are very expensive.
I love the way you look at me.
Shakespeare created many famous characters.
Tom needs someone that he can discuss his problems with.
I am glad to accept your invitation.
Tom pays his debts promptly.
I saw how Tom did it.
I'd like to dance with you.
I saw you cooking.
Where did you hear this?
How long do you think it would take you to read this book?
We'll find out soon.
I hate that movie.
Tom is very hard on himself.
The settlers embraced the Christian religion.
The first lesson is easy.
I don't know why the baby is crying.
What should I wear?
Why do you want to study abroad?
He was given a gold watch as a reward.
I came by to water Tom's plants.
I don't like to stay at home by myself.
He keeps all his savings in the bank.
Send us the photos.
Have you been in Boston long?
I think that Tom is very curious.
The coffee is only lukewarm.
Tom bought gifts for all his friends.
This is the best.
How can Tom do this?
I haven't spoken to Tom yet.
Tom is much younger than you think he is.
He went back to the store.
How much is this ring worth?
Put it in the closet.
Are you single?
Tom stopped clapping.
Boston is changing.
What's the plan for tomorrow?
I'm coming to help you.
Tom said he just needed more time.
Boston is a long way from Chicago.
You may sit anywhere you like.
Leave us alone for a minute.
"We liked the food, especially the fish."
One of Tom's daughters lives in Boston and the other one lives in Chicago.
One language isn't enough.
He came at seven minutes after ten.
"You have a little fever today, don't you?"
May I see your driver's license?
"The sooner you return, the happier your father will be."
We knew you were sick.
I hope that someone will do that.
I hope you're happy.
I don't have a girlfriend.
Tom needs a coat.
He is as lazy as ever.
What did Tom say to you?
Tom works in advertising.
Did the dog bark?
Tom cracked a joke.
Do you have attacks of dizziness?
Nobody has the right to control us.
He saw it also.
Tom hurt his left arm.
I'm bleeding.
I've always understood you.
My daughter lost almost all the coins she had collected.
I'm sure I told you about that.
Tom makes a lot of spelling mistakes.
We can't help you with that.
I know that Tom has already left for Boston.
There are two sides to every story.
"Tom is in the bathroom, isn't he?"
Don't go in that building.
He took the pen and wrote the address.
Can we go to the lake and watch the sunrise?
I don't think that it's a very good idea.
His methods are not scientific.
Almost everyone I know has a bicycle.
Could I borrow your ruler?
I thought that Tom had gone to Boston.
Tom wanted to talk about something else.
Tom's death was preventable.
Tom said he had been busy.
Your life is in danger.
Should I wait for Tom to finish?
"Apart from that, I don't know anything."
"Next question, please."
Tom was diagnosed with autism.
It's your money.
Somebody wrote my name on the wall.
I jumped into the pool.
Tom never was ambitious.
"Tom is in his car, waiting for you."
Why buy something you'll never use?
All the boys are honest.
How do you plan on paying for that?
I went there by myself.
Did you go out last night?
He can't be a poet.
I'd like to dedicate this song to Tom.
Those who want to stay can stay.
What kind of person is Tom?
Everyone was at the table eating dinner.
What's the relationship between politics and war?
"Tom is young, but he's pretty smart."
Don't mind Tom.
Are you happy here?
We don't lose often.
You need to lose some weight.
Do you have any idea what this is?
The boat capsized.
"Tom sat under a tree, reading a book."
I think it's impossible.
We had to leave early.
Tom asked for something cold to drink.
His airplane crashed in the mountains.
You must be so proud of Tom.
I'd rather not touch it.
Here's a new one.
I knew you'd wait.
We're not going with you.
Do you have homework?
It would be dangerous.
I have a feeling something very special is going to happen.
This isn't the first time that you've been late.
Tom looks as though he wants to cry.
Your strategy seems to be working.
You aren't guilty.
I thought Tom liked riddles.
Tom will have to leave.
He took out a piece of chalk.
We'll be hungry.
You can stay with us.
I'm not going to leave today.
It was disgusting.
How much did it cost us?
I caught a big fish yesterday.
Tom will be here tonight.
I don't feel like playing cards.
"You won't tell them, will you?"
She regarded me suspiciously.
Are you going to be ready?
Tom has time to do that.
You have a secret admirer.
Have you tried hypnotherapy?
Tom left his umbrella in his car.
Everybody wanted Tom dead.
He lived to a ripe old age.
What are you playing with?
What's your favorite winter sport?
"It was hot, so I took off my coat."
I heard three explosions.
I paid for the tickets.
I didn't know Tom was jealous.
It was enough.
I don't think that Tom will ever come back.
Come along with me.
We have a very important decision to make.
Refined sugar is bad for your health.
We won't stand a chance.
Go and talk to Tom.
The sky grew darker and darker.
Tom showed us his new car.
I don't think Tom enjoys bowling.
I'll be right back.
Tom smiled bravely.
Tom forgot something.
Let them learn from us.
I'd like to see him tomorrow afternoon.
Tom and Mary have helped me a lot.
Tom is pretty nervous.
Tom is shaving.
The road is three meters wide at this point.
It took quite a while to sort out all our luggage.
Are you sure you want this?
They didn't leave anything for me.
I thought you liked Tom better than John.
Tom is still angry.
Where is your tie?
Do you see what I mean?
Why don't you both give up?
Tom leaned against the fence.
You did everything you could.
I've already spent all the money Tom gave me.
I wanted to do that with you.
I haven't finished eating.
Tom moved here from Boston three years ago.
It's awfully cold today.
I'd rather not sing that song.
I have seen a panda once.
It's a beautiful day outside.
Tom wanted to stay with Mary as long as he could.
Cover up the injured man with this blanket.
There were no people in the village.
Tom spends a lot of time with Mary.
Tom doesn't know what you've done.
Tom listened with interest.
This is Tom's photo album.
I'll make it worth your while.
You need a shave.
It's awfully cold this evening.
English is not my first language.
Tom could have cancer.
You never know what will happen tomorrow.
We're going to have a baby.
Where did Tom buy them?
Isn't it black?
He doesn't have his medication.
I should've left a note for Tom.
It isn't so cold today.
Tom says that he's never tried eating dog food.
We don't have the right to do that.
Tom can't blame anyone but himself.
There was nothing I could do about it.
When do you expect to have your Christmas shopping done?
Tom tried to explain everything to Mary.
What do you think of Tom's idea?
I want a purebred dog.
Tom says he can't prove Mary didn't do that.
Tom died in October three years ago.
May I ask you a few questions?
Will Tom be ready?
He intends to devote his life to curing the sick in India.
"If you think that this is going to be easy, you're wrong."
What did he draw on the blackboard?
I don't know much about it.
I know that you did that on purpose.
We didn't get it.
I'm a rebel.
Things were different in those days.
Are you still listening to me?
You will never defeat me!
Everybody knows that it wasn't your fault.
I think we need to call 911.
Tom said that he was mistaken.
I gave my cold to Tom.
I'm sorry. It was my mistake.
I think we both know why I'm here.
Do you know why?
Tom said that he wants to sell his house.
I'm too tired to eat.
Give me a call sometime.
This old house is made of wood.
That's a very useful piece of information.
I shut the door.
Everyone here likes Tom.
Tom tends to be a bit grumpy.
How much time does it take?
"There are lots of things in that shop, for example, games, toys, and flowers."
Why can't you stay with Tom?
I know what I'm feeling.
Tom called security.
Determine your goals.
We're looking for a lawyer.
Tom asked if I was going to do that.
Tell Tom that I'm sick.
Did you get anything from Tom?
This coffee tastes like dishwater.
Listen carefully. You need to know this.
I'm amazed Tom is still alive.
Beat it.
This was an interesting book.
We've got to go warn Tom.
Tom abused my trust.
Tom isn't jealous.
Did you come for me?
Throw it there.
I don't want you to get hurt.
You said that you loved Tom.
Who does that?
There is a police car parked outside our house.
Why did you sign the confession?
It is a five-minute walk to the library.
When will you be back?
"Tom was sitting under a tree, reading a book."
Tom found a hair in his soup.
Tom told everyone that he passed the exam.
We met last Thursday.
I don't waste time.
I am going to take two days off next week.
He accomplished his mission.
They've taken Tom.
You're going to be famous someday.
We only need one.
Tom found some old coins in his backyard.
They had lived there until they came to Tokyo.
There's no sugar.
The meeting ended thirty minutes ago.
Tom said that somebody here needed help.
Someone is always on duty.
Have a good summer.
What team do you play for?
When is that supposed to happen?
Tom was the last one to find out about it.
I'll take the bus.
I know where you went.
I didn't want any of my friends to know I had been in prison.
Do you want me to translate?
He tried to unify the various groups.
You should try to learn a little French.
I don't have an office in this building.
Aren't you hot?
He had such a bad headache that he had to cancel the meeting.
Time is up.
Nobody I know does that.
Which one will he choose?
Tom waited for Mary at the bus stop.
I wonder who the next president of the United States will be.
I won't run away like a coward.
I was told to get enough sleep.
They live in a small house.
I suggest you tell me the truth.
Tom heard that Mary had died.
I don't live very far away.
I'll give him a pen.
He did not come till noon.
I like that job.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary wants.
It's a wonderful opportunity.
What happened here yesterday?
It's time for us to go back home.
Tom chose to live with his father instead of his mother.
Tom never loses his head.
Did Tom not know how to do that?
Tom was caught cheating on the exam and was expelled from school.
Now don't move.
We're not worried.
Tom started crying again.
Mary and I were like sisters.
Please talk to Tom.
I'm tone deaf.
I can give you an autograph if you want.
I haven't eaten meat for a whole month.
Tom was left for dead.
There weren't any passengers on the bus at the time of the crash.
Did she sleep well?
Please write your name and address.
Does it surprise you?
How much did you make?
I can't even believe I'm saying this.
It's so much fun.
We're fair.
Tom told me to head north.
I promise you that I'll explain everything later.
I saw Tom while I was waiting for Mary.
He's a liar.
Change was in the air.
I feel like I know you already.
Good luck convincing him.
How long will it take to fix this?
I've ordered a book from Amazon.com.
Why are you crying?
You should've apologized to Tom for calling him names.
Tom wasn't telling you the whole truth.
I think Tom may have gotten lost.
Tom is supposed to be home by 2:30.
Tomorrow I'm going back home.
I haven't formed an opinion on the subject yet.
I didn't have to ask.
Do we have to go to Boston?
Tom has only done half his homework.
I must buy some milk.
Wealth does not always bring us happiness.
Tell me when he returns.
He turned pale with fear.
"To make matters worse, it began to rain."
How long would it take you to do that?
I fell off the chair.
Tom swindled Mary.
I saw one today.
Are those your bags?
Sometimes it's better to keep quiet.
You've been lucky so far.
That's not my name.
"Your name wouldn't be Tom, by any chance, would it?"
I know Tom's upset.
Tom didn't want that to happen again.
Tom didn't buy it after all.
I thought you said Tom was married.
Tom told me he'd do that later.
She's trying to repaint her house.
Have you ever eaten at this restaurant?
Take this brochure.
Are you worried about something?
Didn't you know Tom lived in Boston when he was a kid?
My father brought me here by car.
Why are we allowing this to happen?
He is alone.
He's a man now.
Were you surprised?
I was a shy child.
It was me that took out the garbage.
Do you have any idea how much I love you?
Nobody knows how Adolf Hitler died.
Tom should've asked us for help.
I want to know why Tom is doing this.
We're having some equipment problems.
Do they pay you well?
My friends are all married.
Tom and Mary were both sitting cross-legged on the floor.
3 times 5 is 15.
Tom is doing that for the money.
I don't like the way she speaks.
I like Tom's idea.
They got married on Christmas Eve.
Tom realized Mary wasn't kidding.
Red doesn't look good on Mary.
"Sorry, I've already forgotten your name."
The old couple had no children.
Everyone went crazy.
This place is weird.
His car broke down on the way to work.
Tom was wearing a black T-shirt and designer jeans.
Tom had a dog.
They were the first to get into the bus.
You don't want Tom to think you're insane.
Why do you always seem to want to argue?
There is a bottle of wine on the table.
It's only a matter of time.
I don't want to throw this away.
I can't find my hat.
I live frugally.
I think you need help.
That's my specialty.
You aren't allowed to go into that room.
Tom ran up the hill.
I never wear a tie.
He has squandered every opportunity I've given him.
I knew Tom well.
When are we eating? I'm hungry!
Which way will we go?
This package isn't heavy.
"I know you're busy, too."
He can't afford to buy a new car.
Tom is happy here.
I spent hours reading books.
What happened next?
Tom lost a lot of weight.
"Consider this a warning, Tom."
I've got a plastic cup.
I met Tom after work.
I didn't know Tom would go to Boston.
Tom cleaned up the office.
Where have you been all night?
The principal came in after the teacher.
Tom put the engagement ring on Mary's finger.
I hate winter.
They're all here.
How stupid he is!
Thanks for your support.
They have lost a lot.
Don't feel too sorry for Tom.
I'm leaving in the morning.
I'm so happy for you two.
Tom parked his car in the garage.
The Romans built a fleet of three hundred ships.
Have you ever fallen in love?
It's broken.
I like going to concerts.
I'll tell Tom if I don't forget.
I didn't know that we'd need that.
Tom has finished reading the book that Mary gave him yesterday.
"Now, open your eyes."
What did you bring me?
I think you know both of them.
You did what you had to do.
Tom and Mary are just friends.
Tom probably thought I was allergic to peanuts.
I'll take in the washing before it rains.
What did Tom give Mary?
What'll you do after school today?
"By the time you get home, all the cherry blossoms will have fallen."
Do you eat pork?
Tom needs to be back in Australia as soon as possible.
You're disobeying orders.
I'm proud of my son.
I can't do without an air conditioner in the summer.
This isn't an easy decision.
Can I eat this orange?
I'm attracted to him.
The policeman protected the witness.
We can't trust Tom anymore.
I won't be here long.
We're ambitious.
Tom thanked his predecessor.
I recommend you to go by train.
Please cancel my order and send confirmation that this has been done.
Couldn't you do that later?
Let go of my arms.
Tom lives in Australia with his grandparents.
You know Tom doesn't trust you.
Tom said you wanted to see me about something.
I'm looking for somebody.
Tom is a dad himself.
I want to change my life.
Tom drinks like a fish.
Your work is poorly organized.
Why did Tom send you this?
We weren't born yesterday.
Tom translated the article into French.
Please be reasonable.
The devil is in the details.
The stakes were high.
I don't remember your password.
Lean on me.
Tom got mad.
I think that Tom didn't win.
Don't lie to Tom.
Did you ski yesterday?
Nobody is going to stop you.
Tom tried to catch the ball with his left hand.
I think something's wrong.
They're my allies.
I didn't get your last name.
Tom said he was ready to do whatever it took.
I know it was an accident.
You take too much for granted.
Maybe we shouldn't leave early.
I never give up.
I've written three books.
Tom didn't go into details.
It's hardly surprising.
It's already dark outside.
It doesn't matter to me what you do.
Tom knows Australia very well.
The novel is worthy of praise.
We're not late.
Where were you last night?
The bridge between Denmark and Sweden is almost five miles long.
Whatever happened to Tom?
I took off my clothes.
Tom says he's not happy.
Tom told Mary that she shouldn't go there by herself.
"Oh, no! My house is on fire!"
When did you hear about it?
I broke his heart.
Write me when you arrive.
Tom came back an hour later.
I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about.
I know you'll never do that.
I think you went too far.
I'm sure Tom will help you in the garden.
I want you to guess.
A good idea came into my mind.
The dentist told me to open my mouth.
Tom died at the age of thirty.
I never touched it.
That song reminds me of my childhood.
Would you like to come in and have a cup of coffee?
Speaking French is hard.
Tom isn't sure whether he locked the door.
Don't forget to tell Tom to do that today.
Are you open on Saturday?
Tom said that he couldn't breathe.
I know that Tom is unmarried.
This is my new guitar.
I won't let you die.
Tom was in Boston three months ago.
Tom said he was pessimistic.
Did you tell Tom about tomorrow's meeting?
I am following that car.
Are you in a rush?
His cigarette burned a hole in her dress.
Can we move on?
Tom wasn't wearing a blue sweater.
Don't I owe you something?
I'll drink the same thing you drink.
Japan is an island country.
What did I tell you?
Tom got robbed.
You've got nothing to apologize for.
I know that Tom is a good musician.
They need the money.
I left work early.
This book is very small.
Is Tom ready for this?
Write a short essay.
Tom is never going to find me.
Do you want some breakfast?
How long do butterflies live?
Tom says it was your idea.
Tom hasn't been to Boston in over a year.
How can you be so calm at a time like this?
I haven't seen you in here before.
This medicine tastes bitter.
I picked Tom up after work.
I'm not so smart.
I didn't want you to know.
Tell Tom to shut up.
That feels amazing.
My neighbor's dog is dead.
"Tom didn't need to do that, did he?"
Do you like playing computer games?
Tom is lecherous.
I flew from London to New York.
The robber bashed her head in.
"We will be able to raise cows and sheep, too."
Tom fed the horse.
Why do you want to go?
You don't have to go to school anymore.
She pretended not to hear him.
I know that you're currently writing a book.
Tell me where we're going.
Let's park the car here and walk the rest of the way.
"If you wish, I'll ask."
Tom never spoke to Mary about what happened.
You shouldn't be afraid of the future.
I can't stand this cold.
Do it somewhere else.
Where does Tom shop?
I'd like to know what you think.
Do you think Tom has put on weight?
It'll get worse.
Do you want to talk?
"You bought candles, didn't you?"
I didn't know Tom played tennis.
I want to go to Boston with you.
I think Tom didn't understand what you were saying.
How did you know I wanted to do that?
The girl doesn't like to play soccer.
Tom knew the story already.
The two incidents are connected with each other.
Does anyone have a better idea?
"If we knew anything, we'd tell you."
He decided to have surgery.
I've explained the situation to Tom.
We knew Tom was going to be back.
A toothache deprived me of sleep.
Tom sat in the front row.
Tom asked me three questions.
Tom is still too young to get a driver's license.
It'll probably take you about three hours to do that.
She was in agony.
He will keep us informed.
The kid got hurt.
Tom didn't tell me where he had gone.
I can't marry you.
We enjoyed talking with each other.
What is the matter with your car?
American movies are popular all over the world.
She treated him very well.
What's she doing?
I can't come to the phone right now.
Tom rejected this plan.
Tom put on his sweater.
Who were you hoping to talk to?
Tom doesn't want to talk about that.
Tom doesn't like being alone.
Listen to your father.
What did I tell you to do?
Has anyone told Tom about what happened?
What kind of dreams do you have?
Did Tom say how long he'd be in Boston?
I only need a minute.
Do you remember my name?
Tom has achieved his goals.
I think Tom is cheating.
Please do not forget.
Do you want to win or don't you?
I don't think that Tom will be here this morning.
The short circuit blew a fuse.
We don't have time to do that now.
I expect to be back before 2:30.
He is wearing a wool sweater.
I told Tom I didn't want to go.
I don't know why you're laughing.
We'd like to speak with you.
"As far as I know, Tom is still married."
I want you to die.
Put it over there.
Do you have a number where we can contact you?
I didn't want you to leave me.
All you have to do is wait for his arrival.
I think this is what we need.
I don't think that I know anybody here.
Who's already awake?
Please sign here.
You're mine now.
I'm listening to you.
Can he have said such a thing?
You made the right choice.
Do you think you can fix this?
Don't step on the broken glass.
Please don't tell anybody that I did that.
They can't fire me.
Tom is acting as though nothing has happened.
Rambo doesn't exist.
Tom will be at work on Monday.
He's smoking more than ever.
Are you sisters?
I suggest a different approach.
We'll try to be there early.
Thank you for everything you've done.
My brother has a good memory.
I had no idea that Tom and Mary had split up.
I think that she will not come.
I told you I'm not hungry.
How old were you when your father was killed?
I don't think Tom has time to talk to you.
A lot has changed around here since you've left.
Do you think Tom knows who we are?
Don't worry. I'll be back soon.
We must act quickly.
I don't think that we should drink this water.
Why haven't you eaten anything?
You need to call Tom immediately.
We couldn't do it.
"I'm sorry, I can't help you."
Tom and Mary watched a movie.
"The loganberry, which is a hybrid of a blackberry and a raspberry, was accidentally created in the late nineteenth century by an American horticulturist."
Take us home.
She comes to visit us every now and then.
Tom stayed with Mary.
Tom didn't look sad to me.
"When ice melts, it becomes water."
You're not authorized to do that.
I don't watch TV at all.
Tom needs some more rest.
Your bike is better than mine.
Tom collects old coins.
What should we have for dinner?
Everybody expected Tom to win.
The cake is ready.
I'm sorry about your loss.
I said I'd wait for you.
Money was tight.
"Obviously, I was a little shocked."
I sat down.
Tom wasn't in Boston very long.
Let me open it by myself.
"He exclaimed, ""What a dirty face you have!"""
I asked him for a favor.
Tom didn't remember.
When is the intermission?
"Everybody has a right to his own opinion. However, sometimes it's better not to tell anybody what that opinion is."
I'd like to ask you a couple questions.
That isn't what I'm talking about.
You need to act.
He has a brother and two sisters.
I like your room.
We are flexible.
Nobody cares about that.
She had a flower in her hand.
Do you have any aspirin?
I can't find my wallet.
How clever Tom is!
Now are you sure?
I look like my father.
Tom accidentally shot Mary.
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
What's been bothering you?
I'm working on that.
I'd like to speak with my lawyer.
"What more do you want, Tom?"
I think it's time for me to move to the suburbs.
"I wanted to do that, too."
Will Tom leave tomorrow?
The boy complained of a headache.
No one believed you.
You must not go out at night.
Did you know this?
How much longer are you planning to be here?
What does it involve?
I commit my son to your care.
I'm feeling nervous.
You don't look pleased to see me.
Tom spent three months in the hospital.
The difference is staggering.
I don't like pizza.
I didn't do this.
He rarely goes to the movies.
I'm thinking of changing jobs.
You look upset.
Go back home to Australia.
It's an easy victory.
Tom has gone upstairs.
I wasn't sure what to say.
These screws need tightening.
Where would you like to go?
I didn't know they could do that.
I came home early.
Why are you saying that to me?
Sometimes it is pleasant to look back on one's childhood.
This is Tom.
I didn't want to go to the reception.
Tom is richer than you think.
Why don't we take a drive round the island on this ox carriage?
He is doing it with my help.
Which team will win?
I consider that a good sign.
Cut it in half.
Where did you meet Tom?
We've got to escape.
Thank you for the donation.
He's better than us.
What kind of man are you?
Look at it again.
Tom is not a very good dancer.
I wanted to tell you.
I don't think that I'll be late.
I've just started to learn French.
Do you think we'll make the train?
Tom stayed in bed for three months.
Why's Tom mad at Mary?
Tom took a seat at the counter.
Thanks for helping me out.
Would you recognize Tom?
I saw a black cat run into the house.
Tom isn't going to force you to do that.
I usually go to school by bicycle.
We're all going to die someday.
Tom will buy bread.
We believe you.
I think you need to call Tom.
I think you've already met Tom.
I have blue eyes.
Tom wouldn't hurt Mary.
Tell us why you're here.
That's too much!
They found this.
Tom is not here now.
Give me a call if you need help.
"This is for you, I think."
Tom slept much longer than Mary did.
I'm not going to eat this.
I was pardoned.
Tom doesn't even know how to write his own name.
I can't believe that I'm really here.
You were wrong after all.
I know that Mary is beautiful.
What a huge dog!
I ran into a tree.
The country needs your help.
We have a chance of winning.
I'm thinking of buying a new car.
"Tom's crying. ""I know."""
Who lives in this house?
Tom told me that he didn't want to do that anymore.
Tom was hoping Mary wouldn't win.
She bought a vacuum cleaner at the supermarket.
What's Tom cooking?
Tom told me he did that for you.
Tom said he didn't have a lawyer.
Tom deceived me.
Do you have blankets?
Do you like studying?
What's your explanation?
Tom knows him.
Thirteen children and three adults were injured in the accident.
We're prisoners.
I'll go and tell Tom.
Tom often praises Mary.
"Strictly speaking, there were some mistakes in his speech."
You can wait for me here.
Let's give it a whirl.
We hope a solution is found.
My luggage got lost.
I've been looking into the problem.
Let's play baseball!
Tom is climbing a tree.
It's a plant.
Tom lives in a cabin in the woods.
This shirt is too big for me.
Try to control your temper.
The prosecutor asked me a leading question.
Where's the pharmacy?
My father-in-law is a lawyer.
We understand each other.
Tom said he was utterly exhausted.
I want to stay here with you.
It's in my pocket.
He was very worried about having to spend Christmas in the hospital.
He put the box on the table.
I hate it when I dream things that contradict what I feel when awake.
Did you know him?
He doesn't need to work.
The police have a sketch of the suspect.
Tom is clearly busy.
How's your dad?
Has this ever happened to you?
Tom doesn't know what Mary wants him to do.
Why do people have children?
I'm going tomorrow.
I have to stay for a while.
They said you were fired.
Who's that girl sitting over there?
He bought a plane ticket.
The door opened.
I told a bedtime story to my daughter.
Tom denied that he was the one who did that.
Tom tried to deceive Mary.
Tom doesn't want me to help you.
Why do you want Tom?
I've missed you.
I'll be a bit late. Keep dinner warm for me.
Didn't you know that Tom didn't like Mary?
He was kind enough to take us over to the island in his boat.
We sometimes see them.
It was all my fault.
I won't be afraid.
I'm weak.
I have one in the car.
Tom worked for a construction company.
I thought I was never going to see Tom again.
Is that a no?
The whale is a mammal.
We're all basketball players.
I respect people like that.
I felt myself touched on the shoulder.
It's raining now in Boston.
"That's fair, isn't it?"
This is more than enough for me.
I searched the drawer for the key.
Tom never got married.
Do you want to go again?
"If I were you, I wouldn't move to Australia."
Tom looks somewhat irritated.
Please don't tell Tom.
Will we be in time for the concert?
Tom arrives tomorrow.
Tell Tom Mary's on the way.
What's in those boxes?
I forgot to tell them.
Come and sit down.
Do you enjoy watching horror movies?
Tom sells T-shirts at a 30 percent discount.
I don't feel like drinking vodka.
The temperature now is minus ten degrees.
I hope you die.
Can I borrow your phone?
I didn't tell them.
These are for you.
There is no room for doubt.
Tom plays accordion quite well.
It was canceled.
Tom reminded Mary not to be late.
I can deal with Tom.
Tom won't go with you.
Tom has never seen a UFO.
The maid didn't see anything.
I've been living in Australia for the past three years.
He came back two days later.
"If you go hiking in the desert, be sure to take plenty of water."
It rained all day.
This box is twice as large as that one.
Take it away.
Tom isn't used to being ignored.
Please don't do that now.
I have a friend in Boston.
It's clear that the passport is a forgery.
Breathe through your nose.
I'm now working on Park Street.
I had been working for two hours when I suddenly felt sick.
Tom's French is already pretty good.
Tom heard everything they said.
I was used to studying when I was a student.
I'm waiting to talk to Tom.
Is it safe to skate on this lake?
How old is your mother?
My brother is not busy.
Will he be able to come tomorrow?
You need to go to the hospital.
I didn't know you would be there.
Would you like to see Tom?
We cannot finish it before Saturday even if everything goes well.
I'm still married to Tom.
I haven't thought about it at all.
I'm here to ask for your help.
Did you catch the train?
Tom died trying to save Mary.
Tom outlived Mary.
I wanted to talk to you about something important.
I thought you were a doctor.
May I use your eraser? I seem to have lost mine.
I didn't think so.
You're very attractive.
I don't think Tom actually understands.
"Between you and me, I don't like our new team captain."
Concentrate on what you're doing.
Tom began to remove his gloves.
Tom is making tea.
Tom told Mary everything.
My father is very strict with me.
"Hold the elevator, Tom."
You're so late.
Have you ever seen a rainbow?
There are plenty of fresh eggs on the table.
I knew that Tom was a cook.
Please throw me the ball.
I knew that Tom would agree to do that.
How is your daughter?
Now it's serious.
She brought a cup of tea to me.
I don't know what else we can do.
Tell Tom I'll be there in thirty minutes.
Tom is lying on the bench.
Don't underestimate us.
I blew on my hands to warm them.
Fish and red wine don't go together.
I can't be bought.
It's difficult to peel chestnuts.
Let's visit some temples tomorrow.
I'm still married.
That could come in handy.
I don't want your gold.
Tom was bald.
Tom and Mary were waiting for us.
We have to make a plan.
Everybody's busy.
Tom survived.
Tom didn't know that happened.
Everything seemed to be OK.
Do you want to go to prison for the rest of your life?
It's very crowded in here.
Why can't you tell me?
Do you think Tom could win?
Oranges have a lot of vitamin C.
What did they hit you with?
You aren't allowed to take photographs here.
She lay down on the floor and started reading.
Would you like to live in Mumbai?
We all hope Tom wins the race.
I turned down the TV.
Give me the coordinates.
Do you go shopping every day?
I'd really like doing that.
I haven't finished reading the report.
Did you ask Tom if he wants to go with us?
Tom lives in Australia with his parents.
We both fell asleep.
I want you to know I'll always love you.
I won't stoop to his level.
I know the person who stole my car was Tom.
Can we speak now?
"Yes, we can go."
I'll help you up.
You are wearing your shirt inside out.
How often do you wear a hat?
Tom says that Mary cried.
Are you aware of what's happened?
Tom waited for Mary until 2:30.
I buy milk almost every day.
I'm not very busy.
I don't think that I need to lose weight.
How many sandwiches are there left?
Tom wouldn't let me do that.
"I'm so happy for you, Tom."
The painter died young.
I wasn't hungry.
I have a beard now.
We haven't met for ages.
How many chairs are there?
I heard you were looking for me.
I have to stay here.
I got an F in chemistry.
Call if you need anything.
Tom became world famous.
It's good that it's snowing.
Everything matters.
We've done all we can.
I couldn't answer all the questions.
Did Tom see you?
I was so hungry that I ate it.
You said you didn't care.
You're so skinny.
What time does the movie start?
We're the same age.
I highly doubt it.
What's that horrible noise?
Have they arrived yet?
Tom said he didn't know the answer.
Tom is a used car salesman.
I speak French very poorly.
I've ordered you a beer.
You should quit smoking.
"I didn't want to watch a movie, so I read a book."
Don't go anywhere without me.
I would like to pay with a credit card.
I wanted to do that.
Please tell me how to do this.
Pick him up.
Ask Tom to wait for me.
I was hoping you could help me.
Is this Tom's book?
You don't need to explain.
I want you to hug Tom.
"A bottle of red wine, please."
"You like music, don't you?"
I need time to prepare.
So what did Tom say?
There's nothing in the bucket.
It's not even on the map.
I want to talk to her.
I can't believe you're over thirty.
We'll have some guests tomorrow.
How do you know Tom likes Mary?
What were they wearing?
Do you think you can do that by 2:30?
I own this property.
"How old are you? ""Sixteen years old""."
Did Tom call you?
Everyone is saying goodbye to Tom.
Where do you think you're going dressed like that?
Tom doesn't have enough money to buy a new car.
Watch out for Tom.
Tom didn't dare to look at Mary.
Do you think Tom can find it?
Tom said that Mary was sleeping.
Tom was a very good friend of mine until he stole my girlfirend.
I know you were afraid.
Tom is scared to talk to me.
"Tom told me the truth, I think."
Use your gun.
Let's not waste any more time.
I couldn't believe this!
I just want you to be safe.
I don't believe Tom will do that.
I'll be back at 6:30.
Did you know that your air conditioner is broken?
There are many things Tom doesn't like.
You shouldn't go there by yourself.
I would've told Tom if I had known.
I corrected it.
She listened to him.
We're here to protect you.
We were flooded with applications for the job.
I met a friend of mine yesterday.
They need friends.
He is a Japanese boy.
I have no friends to help me.
I did what Tom asked me to do.
Tom looked truly upset.
What are you going to do with that?
They do it faster than us.
"Did Tom go, too?"
I highly doubt Tom wants to see you.
Tom got married when he was thirty years old.
Just get it over with.
Tom isn't one of us.
Was it a joke?
Why was Tom arrested?
When are you going to eat?
This is a fundamental question.
The man lost all hope.
She's the most beautiful woman.
You are so stupid.
I told Tom to go.
He can't go without wine for even a day.
Tom was eager to help Mary.
Her hair is very short.
Tom frowned.
The capital city of the Netherlands is Amsterdam.
I'm the one who saved you.
May I write on this sheet of paper?
Tom said he didn't eat meat anymore.
Tom pocketed the keys.
Are you sure Tom was the one who did that?
Tom was so angry at Mary he couldn't even look at her.
She wants to attend the party.
"No matter what she says, remain calm."
Guess what happened to me.
I'm okay.
Tom admitted it.
Tom sympathized with Mary.
Did you take your pills?
I'll do what I can to help.
Plants require CO2 to grow.
I started to worry.
I'm not sure I'm ready to do this.
Tom worked as hard as the rest of us.
I can't drive a car.
No one knew that but Tom.
Are you ambitious?
It is none of your business.
I was with someone.
He lied to his parents.
He cannot stop us.
The charges were false.
She has an automatic washing machine.
I haven't seen Tom since his birthday.
Tom wants to show Mary how to do that.
Tom needed your help.
I have a penpal.
Tom will hurt you.
Tom is a bachelor.
Delete Tom's name from the list.
I reluctantly agreed.
Didn't you know Tom isn't Canadian?
I want to ask you something.
Do you want to do that today?
Tom has been calling every day.
Tom likes to bowl.
My list is quite long.
What are you girls doing?
I've been in contact with Tom.
The dog always barks at me.
How was the math test?
Didn't you know Tom liked to go fishing?
Do you have blankets?
I'd like to visit Boston someday.
Let me make myself crystal clear.
What was Tom looking for?
How dare you doubt me!
I like the way you sing.
It's too late to help me.
I saw the moon above the roof.
Tom asked Mary for change for a dollar.
We don't think there's another bomb.
Tom knows how to repair computers.
I should've hugged Tom.
Tom has been good to me.
I teach Tom's children French three days a week.
We lock our doors at night.
There's something wrong with this yoghurt.
Don't throw rocks into the river.
We should be able to help you.
Isn't that what you always wanted?
Tom finally came home.
It was a waste of time.
I've only done that twice.
Tom isn't like other boys.
That's just what I thought.
I'm not certain Tom is happy.
Tom is still not accustomed to city life.
Tom suddenly stopped smiling.
I don't want there to be any misunderstanding.
I know Tom likes you.
I'm here to rescue Tom.
Would you do me a favor?
Tom asked me to give him money.
Tom's efforts were rewarded.
Maybe I missed something.
He'll be here any second.
All are present.
Tom opened the blinds.
You'll find out later.
People of all ages like this song.
He's wearing sunglasses.
Tom doesn't go to a good school.
The wind is blowing.
The bridge is approximately a mile long.
Are you following me?
You must clear the table.
Did Tom bite you?
Leave my stuff alone.
How do you like Boston?
Why were you fired?
"I like Boston, too."
I didn't go by car.
Where was it published?
Let's meet in front of the hotel.
I'm sure you would be happy in Australia.
"This is your problem, not mine."
Tom took a sip of lemonade.
My health's very bad.
I told you to leave it in the car.
I want to be there with Tom.
I must go to work.
You said you didn't want that.
Tom thought he was a goner.
Tom has always been a gentleman.
Tom considered it an insult not to be invited to the party.
What's Tom doing today?
You can tell me anything.
What you say is true.
My car is older than this tree.
Did you understand everything?
Has anybody seen Tom lately?
"I was outraged, too."
It's not too hard.
Does anybody have a match?
I wish I hadn't told Tom to do that.
Don't fail to call me tomorrow.
What did you do last night?
The store opens at 9 a.m.
I explained to Tom what needed to be done.
You've seen that.
Next time I'll come earlier.
I told Tom you'd leave on Monday.
You've got to give up gambling once and for all.
Thousands of foreigners visit Japan every year.
I don't even know why I'm telling you this.
We can depend on her to help us.
This building is made of stone.
I felt like crying.
We should wait for Tom.
Is Tom your first or last name?
Is anyone coming besides your friends?
Tom isn't a man you can rely on.
"You don't play golf, do you?"
I have no idea what Tom wants to do.
You're married now.
I told you he was a coward.
That's her boyfriend.
This will come in handy.
We know what we have to do next.
I met Tom who said he had just been to the store.
Is there an inexpensive hotel somewhere around here?
Do it anyway.
Tom almost passed out from the heat.
I asked him if he knew my name.
Let's meet in front of the theater.
You're too good to me.
The bus was so crowded that I was kept standing all the way to the station.
We played on the banks of the Thames.
They know what happened.
Tom is a great actor.
Tom always carries a map and compass in his bag.
How much money did Tom lend you?
You have a future.
Tom may come to Australia next summer.
Tom also speaks French.
We text each other all the time.
I had to choose between A and B.
"No one saw us, I hope."
Tom lost control of his car and crashed it into a tree.
Don't forget to mail the letters.
I was very drunk.
I groaned.
I'll go and talk to Tom.
I can only speak English.
I can't believe I'm really here.
I beg your pardon.
Tom and I never talked about that.
I had a heart attack.
Tom will explain it to you.
We're intrigued.
Tom is here for you.
I wasn't the one who paid the bill.
The sky's getting darker.
They wouldn't have come here if Tom hadn't invited them.
The question is which to choose.
He can speak both English and French very well.
That would be dumb.
He is anxious about his future.
Tom fell asleep during the lecture.
I knew Tom would wait for us.
Tom deserves to be punished.
How exactly did you do it?
I'm very scared.
Are you mad?
Tom seems to know who that woman is.
I don't know where to begin.
You must do it quickly.
He is handsome.
I've already taken the garbage out.
I need to stay in bed.
I'll try to remember that.
Everyone but Tom ate fish.
I don't think it's going to be hard to find Tom.
Is this bag yours or his?
Tom walked Mary to the subway station.
Has Tom been released?
My aunt treats me as if I were a child.
It doesn't hurt that much anymore.
I can buy that for Tom.
I don't know if Tom is dead or alive.
Something's coming.
Tom is talking.
I already know your secret.
A dachshund is a dog from Germany with a very long body and short legs.
I am not concerned with this.
What did you say yesterday?
She is taller than her sister.
I just want to forget about it.
Thank you for the present.
I would tell you if I could.
"Help me with my homework, please."
Don't tell anybody where Tom is.
They feel hungry.
You're so old.
How did you discover that?
I suppose you want to ask Tom some questions.
"I was planning on going to the beach today, but then it started to rain."
I am disappointed.
Tom stopped himself from kissing Mary.
It is not easy to catch a hare with your bare hands.
I will never see him.
Did you know that Tom would be here?
You're the last person I would've expected to see here.
I'll go tell Tom that we're ready.
Do you have to go now?
What are you concerned about?
What don't you have?
I'm going to buy a few bottles of wine for dinner.
Tom spoke into the microphone.
Here she comes.
Why didn't you do anything?
He has a good accent.
I'm going to be home next Monday.
Don't you get lonely?
We should take Tom to the hospital.
Just pretend you don't know me.
Is anybody afraid?
I don't have a gun.
Let me remind you of something.
Tell me about what happened.
Where's the closest drugstore?
What are you doing here so early?
Tom said you wouldn't do that.
Brush your teeth properly before going to bed.
Where were they born?
I want you to be prepared.
I knew you two would like each other.
Tom is open-minded.
He can't tell fact from fiction.
Are you doing your homework?
Can I buy that from you?
You can't use this washing machine.
I knew how to swim.
Don't tell me you're tired already.
Why would you want Tom to do that?
It's safe there.
Why didn't Tom answer Mary's letters?
"It was very windy that day, and I had my umbrella blown inside out."
What do you really want to do?
Tom lives there.
I knew we'd win.
Your English is perfect.
Are you still living here?
He was walking toward the sea.
He was sure that he would make a new discovery some day.
I told you never to call me again.
I'd like to buy some earplugs.
This is a story written in easy English.
"If you don't kill them, they'll kill you."
Tom forgot his umbrella.
Do you know your size?
Why do you have only one glove on?
Tom wasn't the only one who was arrested.
I don't need a suitcase that big.
Thousands of people were deceived by the advertisement.
She is just as beautiful as her mother.
I bought these medications for my father.
I'm glad to finally meet you.
"They haven't finished the work, have they?"
Mary waitressed part-time.
Tom didn't think Mary would be upset by that.
They don't look happy to see me.
He lives all by himself in the country.
She says that she loves flowers.
Both Tom and Mary are fine.
You've convinced me I was wrong.
My camera is waterproof.
Connect the two cables together.
I want to know why Tom is still not married.
A strange thing happened to me yesterday.
May I borrow this pen?
"My mother is a teacher, too."
I don't think Tom expected me to win.
I love American food.
The lakes are frozen.
I want you to know that I'll always love you.
Tom borrowed a pair of scissors from Mary.
How could Tom know that?
Who was that on the phone?
Tom has asked Mary not to do that.
Tom is a very gifted actor.
We went to Boston last month to visit Tom.
I want you to be my coach.
I really don't think that you'd understand.
What time did you arrive there?
Let me open the door for you.
Why did you come so early?
I was beginning to lose my cool.
I'm a journalist.
Tom thinks that Mary and I can't take care of ourselves.
Tom had appendicitis.
We'll be at home all day today.
Here is your change.
"I looked all over for Tom, but couldn't find him."
Yolks are yellow.
Tom and I tried to convince Mary not to do that.
Tom doesn't like to wait.
Have you ever found a four-leaf clover?
What was Tom doing at school?
I love the way you say my name.
That means nothing.
Everybody waited.
I think we need more information.
Tom is riding his bicycle.
He flew to Paris.
You've already given me enough money.
I thought you hated Boston.
Just watch this.
Everybody's a winner.
Tom used to date a Canadian.
You don't have to answer right away.
What did you say yesterday?
"Tom still owes Mary 2,000 dollars."
Can I park my car here?
It isn't polite to stare at people.
Tom lives in the woods all by himself.
What I really want to do is go to Boston to visit Tom.
Can you give me another glass of water?
Tom pointed at us.
Didn't you know Tom and Mary often sing together?
I now know why that happened.
Many people believe that money brings happiness.
Would you like to be famous?
I missed supper.
I'll wait for you here.
"Sorry, I can't help you."
I've decided not to help you anymore.
Which team won?
Did Tom confess to killing Mary?
She returned from a trip.
I wish I could be of more help.
I'm sorry I didn't answer sooner.
I don't know who's involved.
Iron is a very useful metal.
Tom became a taxi driver.
I love flowers.
You're domineering.
Give me the file.
Tom waved goodbye to me.
Keep your eyes wide open before marriage and half shut afterwards.
We'll both go.
You must be very proud of Tom.
This is his car.
The meeting lasted one hour.
Were you jealous?
I stared at the ceiling.
Get down from your horse.
Tom said Mary needs to do that.
Did you help Tom wash windows?
I'm the one who always washes the dishes.
I think that it's dangerous to go walking alone at night.
Tom rinsed the shampoo out of his hair.
You delivered the wrong package.
He is impatient to see you.
Tom said he didn't want to go.
I'm supposed to be here all afternoon.
Why don't we fire everyone and hire a group of new people?
I've never seen you laugh.
We'll meet in the theater.
Did you really think I wouldn't tell Tom?
You cannot take pictures in the theater without permission.
I was a doctor.
The idea seemed absurd at first.
Is that the future?
Why did you go out?
We visited the historic sites of the country.
My bag was stolen.
I've never seen you before.
Do you want to drive?
I don't have time to deal with this.
They went in search of treasure.
"Milk can be made into butter, cheese, and many other things."
What makes you think Tom won't like it?
There is a tall man in the classroom.
It is no use talking with him.
What time do you want to meet?
"For this reason, I can't go with you."
I just found out that Tom is wealthy.
I asked him not to drive so fast.
You may sit here.
Please show me what to do next.
Tom isn't so gullible.
He filed a complaint.

Let's see how this works.
Are you sure Tom was the one who did that?
I appreciate what you did yesterday.
"You made this mess, so clean it up."
I understand why you're angry.

Eat whatever you want.
Can you please tell me where the restaurant is?

Do you really think this is a good idea?
It's like a war zone there.
It was very cold last night.
I have no idea if it'll work or not.
"Anyway, you don't have to worry."
I've been looking for you.

Did you read it?
This looks like a trap.
Tom told me it was stolen.
Clean your room.

Are you a good cook?
Did anyone else help you?
Why is it so important?
I would like to see my father.
I always have fruit and oatmeal for breakfast.

I know where you were.
What gives you the right to talk to me like that?

We'll be waiting.
You're not telling me something.

What crime did you commit?
Tom is now married to John's ex-wife.
The movie was actually much better than I expected.
This house is very small.
Tom never mentioned you.
Is breakfast included?
Tom says he'll go there by himself.
Where's the soap?
I'm going away for a few days.
This one is better than that one.
I was just angry.
I still don't know what that is.
What is it you want to tell me?
Why is it that you're always late?
It's quite simple.
I know the man you came with.
That'll be very easy to do.
There's a horrible mess in the garage.
Tom seemed to be in love.

Did you go straight home after school yesterday?
I've spared no expense in building the house.
I find it difficult to tell Tom I miss him.

You'll never be able to do that without help.
This is a personal matter.
Tom knows what the problem is.
My wife is very upset.
Nobody understands me.
My father is used to travelling.
I think that you need a lawyer.
It's an excuse.
Do you know where they are?
You should have told him about it while he was here.
You can change it if you like.
I'm afraid Tom is dead.

Your letter didn't reach me until today.

Were you talking about me?
Do you know Mary's boyfriend's name?
You can't stop it.
The house is on the hill.
Make me some coffee.
Did you know that Tom was Mary's brother?
Are you really that stupid?

I am sorry to have taken up your valuable time.
They want to see how we react.
I'm not old enough to go to school.
Who did you kiss?
This isn't any fun.
He regrets what he did.
It's likely Tom and Mary will get married in the near future.
I don't know where you are now.
I was baffled.
This is what'll happen.
Didn't you know you didn't have to do that?
Could you explain?
Can I give you this?
"Tom was busy, so he couldn't help us."
I don't have a horse.
Tom is the guy Mary is dating.
I'll call you tomorrow.
I hope I don't get killed.
Tom and I are the same age.
Be careful not to fall.
Did you say your name was Tom?
You must go.
I would like to live in luxury.
We'll sit down and talk about it.
Why does Tom like Boston?
Tom read the news.
I attended Tom's funeral.
Tom hoped he'd be able to win.
I'm still the boss.
I thought it might be you.
Stop being stupid.
Tom bought a bottle of olive oil.
You shouldn't have done it.
You don't have to believe me.
Please don't do that.
Tom asked me how many eggs I'd bought.
The roses are in bloom.
They say red wine is better with meat than white.
He couldn't run very fast.
Tom tried to lift the box.
Tom said that he's not hungry.
Don't you know I respect you?
I wonder why you needed to do that.
Tom does that at least once a day.
It's not rocket science.
I won't tell you my address.
We worked together.
I heard that she came here.
Tom really does like Boston.
I don't want to do that now.
Tom and Mary are doing that.
Can he speak English?
That car is mine.
I sense that Tom is hiding something.
Tom had lunch with Mary.
He wants more.
Would you like to have lots of money?
"Apparently, the bus is late."
That's what I thought at first.
Tom is much heavier than Mary is.
Tom wasn't sure he had enough money with him.
Tom hopes Mary wins.
Tom slipped the letter into the box.
I think I understand now.
I knew you were there.
Tom threw me an apple.
I don't want a job in Boston.
Taste buds are needed to taste food.
Blue looks good on you.
I want you to take a break.
She thanked us for our help.
I have to go now.
Go talk to Tom.
I have three times as many books as him.
"We'd better go, Tom."
What else do you want?
I just didn't feel like getting up.
Tom is very different now.
We managed to swim across the river.
They trust each other.
Did you manage to get something to eat?
I'd be lying if I said no.
The girls went shopping together.
"By the way, are you free tonight?"
Tom is an aggressive person.
I know that you can't speak French.
I can't stand this noise.
May I borrow this book?
You will be held accountable.
All the students are present.
Tom really is an idiot.
They can't afford it.
Tom wasn't unfair.
I'm much better today than I was yesterday.
Nobody wants to work outdoors on a cold day.
It's extremely dangerous.
You'd better stop Tom.
I meet her demands.
It's a wonderful day for a picnic.
Tom is twice as heavy as Mary.
Tom doesn't travel as much as Mary does.
I know you miss your family.
I thought you were a Canadian.
Mary thanked Tom for the flowers.
You must be happy.
You don't have a choice.
He finally succeeded in getting a job.
Tom has already left the office.
Are you planning to go there?
Nothing's broken.
Tom collects Batman and Superman comic books.
The price of bananas hasn't changed much over the past few years.
Who needs a drink?
Tom didn't need to go.
Tom speaks poor French.
"Tom was afraid, but Mary wasn't."
I saw your brother the other day.
We need a little sugar.
Let's not forget about what Tom did.
He had one daughter.
He was welcomed wherever he went.
I've ruined everything.
That's a big problem.
Do you play the piano?
I've decided to tell Tom I love Mary.
"Don't get me wrong, Tom."
Whose dress is blue?
"I understand what you mean, but I'm not sure how to translate it."
There is insufficient light for reading.
He is no longer here.
People don't usually swim around here. The water's not too clean.
Tom told me he could help us.
You broke the law.
What are we going to tell them?
"Compared with the old model, this is far easier to handle."
Maybe there's still time.
"Put on a sweater. If you don't, you'll catch a cold."
I'd better not tell you about that now.
I think Tom might be nervous.
It was a perfect day for a wedding.
I know that Tom loves doing that.
Tom locked himself in the bathroom.
Tom hadn't had time to change.
It's in your bag.
Tom has a brother named John.
Does anyone here know Tom?
Those gloves are mine.
I won't allow myself to be fooled again.
I know that that wasn't correct.
Tom is with his parents.
I'm in a great mood today.
It's a very expensive process.
London is their second home.
I'll make it back in time for supper.
"You're alone, aren't you?"
Look out for bees.
Why do you care?
Camels are the ships of the deserts.
May I see your passport?
I found out why Tom didn't want to come.
I'm sorry I gave you a hard time.
Listen to yourself.
I need a glass of water.
I like this part.
I returned to Australia on October 20th.
My son left today.
Tom refused to help at first.
A car in the parking lot is on fire.
I wonder when Tom plans to go home.
Is that your teacher?
We have freedom of speech.
Who will come with me?
Nobody remembers.
Tom cooks for us every day.
I'm frantic.
You should leave me alone.
Nobody noticed that you weren't there.
It was only yesterday that I realized what she really meant.
Tom didn't show.
There's snow on top of the mountain.
Are you free this evening?
Tom realized what was happening.
Please tell me where to go.
Tom told me he doesn't know Mary very well.
I admit that I'm the one who stole the money.
My mom gets up early every morning.
I sure hope Tom does that.
Stop that right now.
Try to be on time.
I didn't think the house would burn down so quickly.
I'm pretty sure it's broken.
I wasn't quite sure about that.
Don't worry. We'll find it.
I don't think Tom has any bad habits.
The moon moves around the earth.
Tom said he found something.
I admire his wit.
I'll see Tom next week.
Tom has a broad chest.
Tom is in trouble.
Tom found a very old coin in the garden.
Tom threatened me.
Please hurry!
You were our last hope.
She spoke to me in a whisper.
Tom said he believed Mary.
I want to talk to Tom after school.
I think Tom would know the answer to that question.
I shouldn't have gotten up so early.
Look at all those ants.
I want to do it myself.
Why did you let Tom drive?
Tom is there.
I knew it could happen.
Can you take Tom to the hospital?
It's up to us to help them out.
I said I was fine.
He set off to Paris.
I tried to help him.
"Let us go, please."
Why did you choose that particular subject?
All of us live in the same dorm.
Are you our enemy?
Tom has three sons. All of them are doctors.
It's very old.
Tom has already given me permission.
Is anybody else in the house?
You have three pens.
I don't think that Tom wants to go.
I was following you.
Follow your heart.
You made an error.
That was an error on our part.
Would you like that?
Your argument has holes.
My doctor advised me not to do that.
I was greatly impressed by the speech.
Did you really dance with Tom?
What time's your train?
This question is too difficult for me.
They won't know.
How can this be?
I drive a truck.
I have Monday off.
You're getting older.
Do you swim every day?
Tom didn't want Mary to go.
The meeting is tomorrow.
I reached the summit of the mountain in exactly five hours.
Tom ate some barbecued ribs.
We knew Tom was in Boston.
Tom has a rowboat.
The lights are out.
I know I'll never forget you.
This is a list of what I want for Christmas.
I've always been cool.
We've made a shocking discovery.
Try not to be late for supper.
Tom is a bundle of nerves.
Tom ordered a bottle of wine.
I didn't know you could see me.
It's all our fault.
Is this Tom's chair?
I don't know if we needed that.
I thought you didn't know where Tom was.
Tom told me to get lost.
I don't get along with the man who lives next door.
That knot's loose.
I need nine hours of sleep.
"If I told you, I'd have to kill you."
Welcome to Boston.
It's hopeless.
I know why Tom cried.
I'll never forgive you for doing that.
Do you have shoes and socks?
Let's try to do that.
Tom found the drawer empty.
We were about to call you.
Wait!
I'm going to keep it.
Where was this photo taken?
I'm so glad you're here.
Do you want a beer?
You deserve a raise.
Tom is quite active for his age.
I apologize for being such an idiot.
This problem is a real challenge.
His airplane crashed in the mountains.
You said that you were tired.
Put down the hammer.
How many seconds did it take you to do that?
Tom had never seen any of them before.
It's a very serious crime.
You ought to have done the homework.
Tom asked me if I was impressed by Mary's singing.
Do you really want to go there?
The bag is full.
We expected that to happen.
Tom thought about it.
I'm glad you're all right.
Did you really think that I wouldn't do that?
How many people know you're alive?
Tom has never been abroad.
She was born blind.
Where can I see you?
We must repair the damage.
I jumped.
I know Tom is thirty years old.
It was summer and the weather was warm.
She smiled and accepted my little present.
Tom is allergic to that.
Tom spends too much time playing games.
Are you free tomorrow?
Tom has been sitting in front of his computer all day.
Your children will be safe with Tom.
I spoke after him.
It can't be!
Tom taught me a lot.
I told you I don't know Tom.
"Take off your socks, please."
"Your car is fast, but mine is even faster."
I had a stroke last year.
Tom is clearly upset.
I've just come to Boston.
We have to find out what's in the box.
How do you know what's real?
Here is my bicycle.
Tell me why I can't go.
Hand me those scissors.
The king was executed.
He cannot be saved.
My car needs washing.
I know you're in love with me.
He's not a doctor.
Are you hungry yet?
I'm tired of always listening to the same kind of music.
Isn't the weather great?
Do you like English?
I promise you that I'll be there on time.
The climate's very mild.
That's not yours.
I have to pay the bill.
Where did you go with Tom?
Do you want us to help Tom?
How can we thank you?
Tom doesn't want to be a French teacher.
Put on a robe.
We're still the best of friends.
Be quiet while we are eating.
Tom and Mary built a snow fort in the backyard.
He kindly answered the question.
Put that one back.
Are you busy tomorrow morning?
We had an earthquake last night.
Tom's comments ruffled a few feathers.
I know you lied.
When can we move in?
I have a twin sister.
This is an easy question.
I took care of that.
I need to leave before Tom arrives.
Was it fun?
Where did you see Tom?
Vladimir Nabokov was a Russian-American writer.
This is as far as I can go.
You should've stayed in Boston.
Do you want the job?
Tom should've called.
I thought that you didn't smoke.
I've decided.
Tom is playing outdoors.
I know too much.
Are you helping Tom?
Do you think this is a game?
I told Tom that I'd be late.
I don't know how much time we have.
I've just returned from Boston.
When will they arrive?
He is a head taller than me.
Do you have a girlfriend now?
She succeeded in getting him to tell the truth.
I didn't kill Tom.
Tom cooked spaghetti for us.
Brush your teeth after each meal.
I'd like you back on the team.
Open the box.
I'm glad you made it home in one piece.
Don't you think that's a good sign?
I don't want to work for you.
Tom lives in the country.
It's dirty work.
Tom was on the list.
Did Tom say he was worried?
Tom has never been fishing in his life.
Tom told Mary a funny story.
What did you do with my keys?
Don't you think that's possible?
Is there a supermarket nearby?
"We're waiting, Tom."
My parents are dead.
What's the reason?
Our boat approached the small island.
Tom has lived in Australia for a long time.
Tom tried to adjust the temperature of the shower.
You're the most beautiful bride I've ever seen.
Tom is clean-shaven.
Tom can read.
"I didn't want Tom to go to Boston, but he went anyway."
Tom seems to be very rich.
Tell me about your childhood.
Tom and I are cousins.
I'll do the work tomorrow.
Do you get up early in the morning?
I wasn't living in Boston last year.
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.
You must be very proud of Tom.
French is the language of love.
That's all I'm asking.
Tom will eventually be caught.
Where is your room?
I know you're smart.
Does Tom want to see me?
I spent all morning chopping wood.
Tom asked Mary what she wanted.
Take the bags upstairs.
That's hogwash.
Everybody knows that you are a liar.
I plan to stay here for three days.
Tom could sell anything.
Tom has been offered another job.
Who discovered the island?
Didn't I warn you not to go there?
Tom doesn't know the difference between geography and geology.
I've always loved Christmas.
They don't want you to use it.
Let's not do this again.
The building fell down.
You don't seem to agree.
I'm not going to allow that.
She explained to him why she was late.
He is second to none.
That was the easy part.
I told her to sit down and drink a glass of water.
Let's not do things we'll regret.
I went to the river.
Did you guys hear what Tom said on TV?
Tom realized that he had lost his wallet.
"I'd sure like to see them, but I won't have the time."
"Come on, spit it out!"
Tom changed into his school uniform.
Just tell us what you saw.
He expressed his dissatisfaction.
Take me to the hospital.
Write down his address.
Ants are social insects.
The situation is out of control.
I was just pretending I was sleeping.
"Sometimes, people lie."
How many eggs are there in the fridge?
Did Tom say anything to you?
The beauty of the sunrise was beyond description.
You don't have to sing.
It's a new movie theater.
How do you know that?
Falling rocks present a danger to climbers.
Where did I leave my glasses?
He spent no more money than was necessary.
I can drive you.
You're supposed to be working.
Have you made sure the door is locked?
Tom is the one who can help you.
I don't know how to speak French properly.
Where did you find it?
Let's hide behind the curtain.
Mary is helping her mother.
Will you wait for me?
I have to help Tom move the piano.
Did you think I would leave you here?
That big mouth of yours is going to get you killed.
Is that mine?
Tom wasn't like that at first.
Tom was blinded by love.
Tom really did die.
I taught Tom how to swim.
Tom wants a new hat.
Tom forgot to buy milk.
Aren't you married to Tom?
I love French.
I tried not to look.
They'll find Tom.
Tom didn't need to go to Boston.
What do you really want to say?
I want you to return to your seat.
What is the matter with your car?
We didn't want to do that.
It's in my jacket pocket.
I'm not a kid.
"Because of rain, I could not go out."
He's the fifth man in line.
"You don't know how to do it, do you?"
Tom lives 10 miles from the Canadian border.
I'll rephrase the question.
I don't think that Tom wants to go to Boston with Mary.
Could you leave us alone?
Tom talks about Mary all the time.
We really have a lot in common.
I was at a party with some friends when I met Tom.
I don't like Boston at all.
I saw Tom running down the street.
"In theory it is possible, but in practice it is very difficult."
We've been ready for a long time.
I have a friend whose father is a lawyer.
Which team do you think is better?
Tom wondered if Mary understood what she was reading.
Tom told me he wanted to go.
There is an urgent need for donations.
I admire your courage.
May I call on you some day?
Let's hope so.
Can you promise me you won't tell Tom?
I'll cook you dinner.
I'm not very busy right now.
It's not easy to thread a needle.
I'd like it very much if you'd stay.
I just listened and kept quiet.
How did you know Tom was going to help us?
I had my driver's license renewed last month.
I want everything.
We can't afford it.
I just need to know the truth.
Everybody here knows you don't eat pork.
You'd better go to sleep.
I tried again.
I won't go.
You'd better leave now.
Can you repair this?
Tom didn't want to think about it anymore.
They'll do something.
I don't think we'll have any problem with raising the money we need.
I'm feeling drunk.
Don't ask me stupid questions.
I quit smoking three months ago.
That's how Tom died.
Tom is ready to go.
I was studying French when you called yesterday.
Tom works on Monday as well.
Tom has denied the accusations.
How much wine did you buy?
We don't owe Tom anything.
Tom thinks Mary is jealous.
I'll always be here.
We look up to you.
Their bodies were never found.
It's time to clean your room.
Aren't you going to apologize to Tom?
Tom is a good man.
What does your sister do?
Let's get down to business.
Tom didn't have to pay anything.
"Tom stayed on the bus, but everybody else got off."
He made me happy yesterday.
We're studying French.
It's only a three-hour flight.
We don't have anything to worry about.
"Come on, move it."
I've got to figure this out.
Tom has been shot three times.
I like neither of them.
Tell me about your childhood.
It's still better than nothing.
Did you ask the others?
Please remember to write to her.
They scaled the cliff with difficulty.
Tom has just returned.
Please promise me that you'll never lie again.
What do you study a foreign language for?
This button has come off.
The history of Rome is very interesting.
I need to study harder.
We bought a pound of tea.
Can you get me another pencil?
Tom has the information we need.
I'm all alone here.
We all fell asleep.
He solved the difficult problem easily.
Do you know why Tom doesn't like Mary?
Do you want me to do it again?
I don't deserve to live.
I know how close you are to Tom.
Do you know how to pronounce this word?
I know you don't like me anymore.
I promise I'll take good care of your dog.
It must be a mistake.
Open the safe.
She gathered the pieces of the broken dish.
Tom blocked my way.
You should continue until you're satisfied.
I still haven't voted.
The news broke his heart.
Tom likes watching action movies.
I'd leave a message.
Can I have your full name?
Tom is also from Boston.
I went out for lunch.
Don't you realize what you've done?
The conference was not a complete success.
Plants need water and sunlight.
This is an extremely important point.
There's no alternative.
Tom called to say he'd be late.
His brother had been a truck driver for thirty years.
Tom knows the way.
Can you send the bellboy up?
Tom moved to Australia quite a few years ago.
You'll regret it.
We bought it in Boston.
Why are you doing this to me?
Tom didn't go to Boston.
I'd like to listen to music.
She is mad at me.
This is an opera in five acts.
I hate silent movies.
Say hello to Tom.
"To put it briefly, he lacks musical ability."
Tom and Mary must have something in common.
You're probably hungry.
Explain yourself.
Are you free now?
Tom said it was fun.
Tom accepted the offer.
What have you learned about Tom?
He took care of the business after his father's death.
I know hardly anything about it.
Don't let him down.
Right after the teacher finished the class the bell rang.
Go back home to Australia.
Can you lend me a little money?
We can't wait that long.
Did you talk to Tom?
"In the end, he landed in jail."
It's about 30 minutes from here on foot.
"Are you angry at me? ""You bet I am!"""
She is wearing a valuable ring.
What was Tom wearing?
Do you have any children?
You're the most interesting person I've ever met.
Tom will be shocked.
I've got great news.
Tom thought it would be a good idea to start a website that sold nothing but popcorn.
Tom goes to bed after midnight.
He told me a long story.
I'm here on business.
I'll look after Tom.
The exhibition will be open for another month.
I wasn't flirting with Tom.
Tom searched Mary's room.
I suspect that Tom knows this already.
Did I lock the door?
You know everybody.
What do you think Tom will say?
I am disgusted with you.
Shoes are sold in pairs.
I agreed to wait.
"I'm sorry, but I can't go with you."
I want Tom to respect me.
I don't think that I know anybody in Boston.
It's your money.
No one disagreed.
Can I stay with you?
I don't take a bath every day.
"Tom likes jazz, but I don't."
The money is in the well.
Tom laughed good-naturedly.
I think Tom is more intelligent than Mary.
You're a weird kid.
I've got everything under control.
Can you put up some extra guests for the night?
"I'm not too late, am I?"
Tom is very obnoxious.
You have to stay away from Tom.
Tom drove very fast.
Tom and Mary have always been friends.
You missed the target.
I became a Catholic because I'm extremely pessimistic.
Get lost!
Now you do it.
Your approval is not required.
Tom doesn't know his neighbors.
I hid myself behind the tree.
I told Tom to leave early in the morning.
I have good news for you.
I thought maybe you'd found out something about Tom.
I knew you would come.
Tom told me that Mary was upset.
You have brought shame upon our family.
Ten people were slightly injured in the accident.
"If I had enough money, I could buy it."
Tom and I don't know each other.
Everybody's safe.
Is it sweet or sour?
I'm a little drunk.
What's the difference between lions and leopards?
I haven't seen her for ages.
I used to love Mary.
I've had a lot of fun so far.
Please sign your name on the contract.
I told you never to come here again.
I want you to clean your room.
He would be very glad to hear the news.
That cake looks good too. Give me a small piece.
Birds were singing in the woods.
Do you like waffles?
Please tell Tom that Mary called.
She was a former first lady.
Tom said that's no problem.
What time do you want to eat?
We have no plans to do that.
I read a book while I waited.
"I will accept the work, provided that you help me."
What do you want me to do exactly?
They don't belong in there.
Can you prove Tom didn't do that?
Have a nice flight.
The movie is popular among the youngsters.
The chief crop of our country is rice.
This belonged to Tom.
I don't have a car and Tom doesn't either.
Tell Tom I'm not at home.
Turn your bag inside out.
Tom has poor eyesight.
We're not terrorists.
Tom didn't want to help.
Is there any milk left?
I know it's Tom.
I thought you didn't have one.
What is it now?
Tom knows how much it'll cost.
Tom loves me.
I think Tom is hiding something.
Tom thinks you're lying.
I don't spend much time at home.
Shut up and do what you're told to do.
That was a good movie.
I thought I was too old.
What are we going to do this summer?
It's always interesting in Boston.
I know Tom and Mary broke up.
You've passed the exam.
I don't know how to address you.
Tom isn't the right man for this job.
I slept only two hours.
Tom carefully removed the letter from the envelope.
I've never gone to Boston.
I'm not sure we're doing the right thing.
You're very photogenic.
She was very proud of her father.
Which eye is hurting you?
I go to work by car every day.
I'm going to brush my teeth.
You promised that you would help me.
Where is your money?
Tom isn't even going to try to win.
We don't have too much time.
Tom didn't go to college.
Could you open the car window?
Would you mind cooking something for us?
Where did you go on your summer vacation?
Is this place secure?
I respect your opinion.
There's so much I want to do.
Tom got these tickets for nothing.
These are decisions I want to make alone.
She left her son alone in the car.
The train has just arrived here.
Tom's dog has died.
Tom stared at Mary blankly.
We both know how that turned out.
All the flowers in the garden withered.
Did you say that Tom is your friend?
I won't be able to convince Tom.
Tom has been deported.
What did Tom suggest you buy?
Tom flew in from Boston this morning.
Tom was only three years old when he first came to Australia.
We're really happy.
He's considering becoming a sailor.
I knew Tom would kiss you.
Tom and Mary broke up three days ago.
I was in school.
All you have to do to take a picture is push this button.
You won't like it here.
Could we have a fork?
You promised that you'd do that.
You're up very early this morning. Do you have something to do?
Tom said he was adopted.
Tom washes his hair almost every day.
"Instead of going himself, he sent his brother in his place."
Sometimes people make the same mistake over and over.
I wanted to talk with you.
Was Tom there?
You're going to ruin your eyes.
Tom should've stayed.
"Tom kissed Mary, not Alice."
Tom was just about to leave.
You lied to the FBI.
You have only to push this button.
Sign here.
Check if everything is correct.
The bus came to a stop and everybody got off.
My advice wasn't followed.
There's nothing more I can teach you.
Everyone wants something.
Do you know Tom's blood type?
Thousands of people lost their jobs.
Tom couldn't understand why Mary didn't like him.
I think Tom already knows.
I'm not mad. I'm just disappointed.
The boy jumped into the water.
She likes wine.
I don't mind sleeping on the floor.
She claimed to be the owner of the land.
She's driving them to school.
Now my friends are upset.
I think we should take a break.
How's the patient feeling this morning?
Mars has two moons.
Why not take your coat off?
I suppose everyone thinks I'm crazy.
Tom decided to quit his job.
You look very good in blue.
I'm heading towards Boston now.
I wanted you to see me.
Tom is unsophisticated.
I think this is too expensive.
All you had to do was ask and I would've lent you as much money as you needed.
I'll be back in a couple minutes.
Tom is always perfectly dressed.
I'm sending you a birthday present by airmail.
You may come whenever you like.
Please tell me where you got this.
I don't think we should eat this.
He's a goal keeper.
Where is the nearest telephone?
They probably didn't hear you.
Tom broke up with Mary.
Can anyone answer my question?
She was born with a silver spoon in her mouth.
Do you think we'll be able to do this without any help?
The price of meat dropped.
I intend on fighting till the end.
I thought you were done.
I wasn't able to pass the test.
She expects him to show up on Saturday afternoon.
He was framed on a murder charge.
He is a man of few words.
I'm very grateful for your help.
I can't find it. Are you sure it's here?
Call a doctor.
I explained to Tom why we had to do that.
When will you get through with work?
A bowl of rice is about 180 grams.
Tom said that Mary was ticklish.
She spends most of her money on clothes.
I haven't understood anything so far.
Tom interpreted for Mary.
I'll come back soon.
I told you that I didn't know.
Tennis is my favorite sport.
Tom was looking for something.
Would you like to go with Tom?
I'm happy to hear that you're doing well.
May I turn off the light?
See you tomorrow morning.
Are these your skis?
What's your third wish?
I'll be seeing him tomorrow.
It's no problem at all.
Have I done something to offend you?
That car's so big that parking it is difficult.
I have two bad teeth.
"Shut your mouth, Tom."
You didn't tell me Tom speaks French.
Tom went there alone.
Tom wasn't very good at swimming.
This is disappointing.
Tom arrived at midnight.
He walks to school.
This directly concerns you.
"If we do that now, we won't have to do it tomorrow."
I'm at home most of the day.
They were laughing.
Is Tom still up?
"During hot weather, be sure to drink lots of water."
I've told you everything I remember.
I don't want Tom to think I'm not grateful.
I know somebody has to do that.
Why are you so concerned?
This is the best tasting pear I've ever eaten.
I found the cat.
What'll they do to you?
"By the way, what is your address?"
A dog is following us.
I have a surprise for you guys.
Tom said you wanted to see me about something.
I saw your photos.
Our dog is black.
Tom asked Mary to lend him some money.
Tom suffered from depression.
I thought I told you to keep the door closed.
I change my underwear every day.
I'm not very happy.
I have to check with Tom first.
A stranger spoke to me.
He suggested we should start at once.
Tom talked to me about that already.
The company gave out a press release.
It must be a virus.
Did you win?
I chose him a nice tie.
I will live in Sasayama next year.
We must try to conserve our natural resources.
Where were you last night?
I don't think that I can find the time to do that today.
Something must've happened to Tom.
I always wanted to do this.
I'm buying a new car.
"I'm not saying this to hurt you, but it's the truth."
Have you ever driven a sports car?
I'm a rich man.
"Tom wanted to ask a question, but thought that he shouldn't."
My room is always clean.
How do you know it was Tom who broke the window?
Where have you been all this time?
I'm going back to school.
That means Tom was right.
Promise me that you won't do that again.
I brought it for you.
Please be merciful.
"Watch your mouth, Tom."
I don't understand that myself.
You never told me that.
It happened in Boston.
Tell Tom Mary doesn't want to go.
I don't drink wine anymore.
Everyone was hungry.
He succeeded in swimming across the river.
Tom heard Mary talking to herself.
How can we avoid that problem?
I get a physical examination once a year.
That's just a start.
Tom remained outside.
It gets dark about half past five these days.
Can I borrow yours?
Do you need anything?
I must have my car fixed in a few days.
Tom hasn't say a word to me all day.
I want to get rid of it.
"You don't win very often, do you?"
Have you bought your Christmas gifts yet?
I no longer live in Boston.
I kept on walking.
You haven't done anything wrong.
Have you been a good boy?
Listen to the music.
We all want Tom to be happy.
Who bought you this dress?
Can I borrow your dictionary?
"To my surprise, the door was unlocked."
You never called back.
I've seen Tom at work.
You'd better take an umbrella.
I'm starting to feel guilty.
How exactly did Tom die?
Tom is bleeding again.
We need to put a stop to this now.
"After the fire, only ash was left."
I'm sure you'll find a good job.
I'll do that later.
Tom is home alone with his dog.
This is not a game.
Don't play with me.
I need to find it in a hurry.
The speaker paused and then went on talking again.
What format should I use?
I need to talk to you afterwards.
I'm angry with Tom.
How long have you been staying in Boston?
Tom also went fishing.
I told Tom about what had happened.
Have you fed the horse?
I guess Tom didn't want you to know the truth.
Where is the accent on the word 'Australia?'
Choose one from among these.
One man was injured.
Heat it up.
Tom said Mary would do that.
Where exactly did you go?
Tom doesn't need to study French.
"Which do you like better, dogs or cats?"
You have to be prepared for anything.
You look like a boy.
"Tom, if you're not going I'm not going either."
I want to be a magician.
The man is mourning after receiving sad news.
I thought I told you not to come.
Tom has achieved so much.
All of the apples that fall are eaten by the pigs.
I don't understand what you want me to do.
No one here knows anything.
Do you like this color?
"I tried, but I didn't succeed."
I didn't want to embarrass you in front of your friends.
You sing better than I do.
My grandfather loves to read.
Don't tell me you threw it away.
We elected Tom captain of our team.
I don't know you.
We don't want to lose you.
I will do as you say.
The cost of living has increased drastically.
I don't work today.
We should sit down.
Tom and I hugged each other.
Tom likes blondes.
Are you in need of help?
Tom knew what was happening.
Tom has been very active.
They elected her president.
These trees will never bear fruit.
Cut the melon into six equal pieces.
"Why don't you do that, too?"
I have to find out why Tom died.
Tom hasn't signed the contract yet.
Do you like to sing in the shower?
I'm trying to help you become a better person.
Let's put this in the trunk.
Tom should've told me sooner.
I knew your father well.
Let's see if it works.
Don't panic!
The food here isn't fit to eat.
Do you do that every Monday?
Everyone but Tom was busy.
I saw her at the party.
I think that Tom will go to Australia.
Tom tried to warn Mary.
"I wanted children, but Tom didn't."
I wanted to eat pizza.
Tom knew there was nothing he could do.
I'd like to change my reservation from three to five nights.
The fourth month is called April.
Tom was lost in thought.
No one understands me either.
Bring your friends with you.
"Could you call me tonight, please?"
Tom left this morning.
We all desire success.
I interpreted your silence as consent.
I consider it my duty to help my parents.
When was the last time Tom cleaned his room?
I know that you don't care what happens.
This is just what I wanted.
I hate that.
Do you need a doctor?
Don't leave me again.
I know that Tom is a journalist.
I really need to get some sleep.
Autumn leaves crunched under Tom's feet as he walked up the path to Mary's front door.
What makes you think you won't be able to do it?
I totally disagree with you.
I've decided that I'm going to shave my head.
Wake up.
I didn't mean to frighten you.
Tom is very happy that his team won.
When was the last time you saw the cat?
Why did you decide to study French?
Tom felt homesick.
Please turn on the light.
Tom said he had a good weekend.
You've got three months left.
That was predictable.
Where are your children now?
I would like to have lunch.
He loves no one but her.
When did you start writing songs?
I prefer red wine to white wine.
Give me a goodbye kiss.
I turned off the TV.
She doesn't know what she's talking about.
I wonder why Tom cried.
I want to know where you plan to live.
No one has the right to tell me what kinds of clothes I can wear.
Whose is it?
Tom refused to compromise.
Tom wants to buy our old car.
He began running.
I was the last one to know about that.
We live in an apartment.
This is a picture.
Tom was at home when that happened.
I will do everything within my power to help you.
I thought you were staying at Tom's.
Tom won't like it if you win.
Everyone found it interesting.
Is Tom fighting?
You're not going to die.
Don't you want to know where I was?
I don't understand.
I'll try to forget everything.
I was busy yesterday.
Isn't that Tom?
He is the tallest of the three.
Your fingerprints were found on the gun.
I'm just a housewife.
Tom deserves the promotion.
Are you rich?
It'll never happen.
We'll accept your conditions.
Tom learned French in school.
Sheep eat grass.
Can we start?
I'm sorry. I forgot about this.
Tom didn't have to go.
Someone is knocking at the door.
"I agree with Tom. ""So do I."""
It's not a good idea to ask a woman how old she is.
How are things at school?
Tom apologized to the audience.
I think Tom is unambitious.
Tom heard the doorbell ring.
Tom tried to defuse the situation.
Tom doesn't remember his first French teacher's name.
I don't think that it was Tom's fault.
You'll just have to wait.
It's not as scary as you think.
Tom asked his father if he could go to the movies.
Green is the color of money.
Tom always wears his seatbelt.
I don't have time.
Are you vegetarian?
Greece has many islands.
"I'm glad we agree, Tom."
My guitar is a lot better than yours.
I'm doubtful.
Why do I have to work with you?
Tom didn't know where to catch the bus.
Tom said we have to keep this secret.
I can never tell when Tom is joking.
Tom asked Mary to do his homework for him.
We're not one hundred percent ready yet.
Tom is on the back porch.
I acknowledge my mistake.
Please don't enter the room without knocking.
You're still alive.
"The plans were drawn up, but the deal fell through."
Can we come in?
Do what you like.
You promised that you would help me.
I like to play basketball.
"Of course, I remember you."
I haven't been invited to the party.
Tom tossed the keys to Mary.
I'm almost finished here.
Tom sold me his old car.
I thought you'd forgotten.
Tom told us you were busy.
Tom had a tooth pulled out last week.
I know that's not enough.
Are you happy here?
Have you been waited on?
Who's the owner?
No one knew that.
Is the tap water in Australia drinkable?
I let Tom win.
I didn't even know that you had a horse.
I don't think that I have any bad habits.
I don't answer the phone when I'm working.
Tom gave Mary a push.
Everyone is entitled to his own opinion.
"Tom is boring, isn't he?"
I don't speak French as well as I'd like to.
He is afraid of the dog.
So what is it you want me to do?
Please keep me informed.
"Tom said he'd be here, but I can't find him."
What do pelicans eat?
I have to read this article.
You won't die today.
Tom didn't ask Mary to come.
I believe that everything will be fine.
You aren't like the other kids.
He did not regret his decision.
Did you think I was Canadian?
He has no interest in art whatsoever.
The baby has been crying for almost ten minutes.
It'll have to be done forcibly.
Write down his address.
Tom would never do something like that.
I have a good life now.
I'm going to the well to get water.
Tom didn't want to go to the beach.
What is my room number?
Has Tom told Mary that he's married?
Tom said he believed that.
Call me at 2:30.
I know that Tom doesn't like Mary.
Let's not forget the reason we're here.
You deserve a medal.
Everyone was late but me.
I didn't want to lose Tom.
How is the weather today?
I guess it's a secret.
You're probably hungry.
You're getting more and more beautiful every day.
We are authorized to use force if necessary.
Would you like to be a sailor?
Please allow me to ask you a few questions.
Tom was in too big of a hurry.
I've been married.
Take these.
Tom says Mary was happy.
Thirty-four of them were lawyers.
"Tom has a problem, and he wants to solve it."
You don't even know me.
Tom believed everything I told him.
Tom knew Mary couldn't speak French.
They want to meet you.
Tom is the only breadwinner in the family.
Tom lifted Mary in the air.
I'm not done with Tom.
He is allergic to house dust.
This is the only pair of shoes I have.
That's what we need.
Don't pretend you don't know what I'm talking about.
The soldiers occupied the building.
Can I stay at your place tonight?
The parade had already begun when we got there.
Is it open on Sunday?
No one will be hurt.
Let me give you some examples.
Tom is much better today than yesterday.
What did you show Tom?
I'm sure Tom will like his new job.
Tom sat at his desk writing something.
We can't stand by and let this happen.
"If your father asks your mother a question in French, does she answer in French or in English?"
I'm sure you need this more than I do.
I can neither confirm nor deny this.
My name doesn't appear on the list.
He knows how to make a radio.
Do you keep a diary?
I thought this might interest you.
I'm not you.
Raise up your left hand.
I knew something like this would happen.
Tom came with his brother.
I am not in the least concerned about the result.
I'm too tired to concentrate on this problem right now.
There's still a long way to go.
She's wearing tights.
I'm the boss.
Tom does what he wants to.
I'll tell you on the way.
Tom kept his word.
I'll do what you ask.
Dig a deep hole.
We both won.
Tom pointed up to the ceiling.
I felt lost without Tom.
Who broke this?
Tom said you were here.
We are suffering from a severe water shortage this summer.
Your parents are back together.
Give me what I want.
Tom can do that himself.
I've met someone.
How are you going to do that?
We have a little water.
"It's very cold this morning, isn't it?"
You should be sleeping.
Tom brought his dog.
Do you want to talk about it or not?
My uncle died of cancer of the stomach yesterday.
Tom thinks he speaks French better than Mary.
I haven't seen you in almost three years.
You don't understand.
How much do you want to bet?
I admit it. I was wrong.
Tom wasn't sleepy.
He was unaware of the danger.
Why hasn't anybody ever told me about it?
Did you call a doctor?
Tom has promised to come again.
She introduced her sister to me.
Give me back my hat.
When did you start liking baseball?
You're under arrest.
Does Tom have your phone number?
Get out of the car.
Don't you know her name?
I don't wanna go back.
The train disappeared from view.
I want you to listen to me.
Are you a police officer?
"Tom, please be careful."
"It's not what you do, but how you do it that matters."
We have everything.
I'd prefer not to answer.
I thought it was a good idea.
Tom told me nothing.
"We are exploring new sources, such as solar and atomic energy."
Tom concealed the fact that he had been in prison.
I could not help laughing when I saw him.
I suggest that you see Tom.
He laughed.
I must object.
"I don't speak French, but I can understand it a bit."
Tom said that he'd rather not see that movie.
I wasn't careful enough.
Tom named his hamster Cookie.
What teams were playing?
Tom is holding a bottle of beer.
Tom said that nothing like that would ever happen again.
I was getting a little nervous.
"Don't forget to say ""please"" and ""thank you."""
Tom and Mary live in a trailer.
Mary often wears high heels.
Don't open the windows.
I thought you wanted to wait until Tom arrived.
Tom never said he hated Mary.
Did Tom tell Mary how many apples to buy?
Is there anything I should know?
I had nothing to say.
Do you want to be stuck here for the rest of your life?
Where are your parents now?
Give Tom a dollar.
Tom isn't even trying.
I was trying to be nice.
Tom stopped knocking on the door as soon as he realized Mary wasn't home.
Have you told Tom that his dog died?
I think she will not come.
They said they would not fight.
What would've happened if Tom had come?
I know that voice.
Let's do that together tomorrow.
I'll start this evening.
Visit us tomorrow.
Tom brought a salad.
Tom had to cancel his trip to Australia.
I just want to get out of here as quickly as I can.
Do you want me to tell you why?
Tom is 100% correct.
What's your favorite European city?
I hadn't even noticed.
Where are you going in such a hurry?
Tom stared at Mary intently.
Call your father.
I am going to the swimming pool.
Tom told me that Mary was on a diet.
My house is near the school.
Have you ever read the Koran?
I looked at the picture.
She acknowledged that my statement was true.
It may have been Tom who broke this window.
Why are you still unmarried?
He got engaged to my cousin.
Would you like to come in?
We know what you told the police.
Tom wanted both of them to leave.
I am leaving next week.
You're not going anywhere.
Even Tom knows that.
Can you tell me where the nearest bus stop is?
Tom and Mary used to be engaged.
When do you think he'll be back?
You have made many mistakes.
Do you think I'm a thief?
How do we stop Tom?
Tom answered the question.
What're you doing there?
I need a hairbrush.
You made a fool of yourself.
Tom pressed a hidden button.
Tom is always asking stupid questions.
He moved out of his parents' place.
You were just doing your duty.
Tom was sitting silent for half an hour.
Tom asked Mary how much she had paid.
I don't know how to say this in French.
Get your paws off me.
I have to alter my clothes because I've lost weight.
You're the only person I know here.
My friends call me Tom.
They worked together side by side.
Everything in Tom's house was covered with dust.
I don't want Tom to wake Mary up.
I need to see you in person.
These shoes are so tight that I can't put them on.
Doing that was difficult.
He violated a law.
I'll go and get you a cup of coffee.
Don't look at me like that.
I am looking for room with twin beds.
Tom helped his father.
The most important thing in life is to be yourself.
Let's put an ad in the paper.
"Excuse me, could we have some more bread?"
Tom wanted to talk to Mary about something.
Tom doesn't often see his brother.
Tom has probably gone fishing again.
Do you like your teachers?
America loves you.
I wasn't expecting that.
I can do it blindfolded.
Didn't you know Tom was going to go to Boston with Mary?
Tom had prepared his answer.
I'd like you to see my collection of stamps.
There's no doubt that Tom is lying about it.
She is strong.
"Without your help, I would fail."
Why are we going this way?
Tom is extremely lazy.
Tell me how to do this.
The tree's roots extend deep into the earth.
I like Chinese food.
We go there often.
My father has gone to China.
You don't know what it's like to be poor.
He can't do it.
You can have it.
Why don't you wait till morning?
I'm looking forward to the return of spring.
Let's not study French today.
What did you want to tell me?
Throw them overboard.
He carried out his mission very well.
Tom knew Mary was lying.
Do you know how Tom did it?
That desk does not fit in this room.
May I use your toilet?
Isn't Tom on your side?
You're the only one to survive the attack.
That doesn't sound quite right.
I think Tom will be happy with the results.
Are you sure we have enough money to buy everything?
Have you talked to Tom recently?
I hear that you kissed my girlfriend.
The day is getting longer and longer.
I hope you find it interesting.
Tom knows that it isn't a good idea.
Tom is a lot older than us.
Tom didn't go home.
I think that'll happen.
Tom is already sitting at his desk.
Tom says I'm too trusting.
I wonder why some people think black cats are unlucky.
Tom said not to talk to you.
Didn't you know Tom and I used to be married to each other?
Everyone must obey the rules. Those who don't will be punished.
Her hair is long.
I know we can do that if we try.
I see a red car ahead.
I'll sing today.
Tom wasn't wearing a helmet.
Tom walked down the hall alone.
I think they want you to do it.
I never had a chance.
I don't think Tom knows why Mary didn't do that.
He was drunk on beer.
Tom is in his room packing up his stuff.
How old is your mother?
Can I try one more?
Every language is equally precious and dear to its speakers.
I'd pay to see that.
Both Tom and I live and work in Australia.
You don't have to sing.
Tom found Mary very friendly.
We can go to the museum.
Both of Tom's parents were teachers.
Tom and I did everything we could.
"Where are my glasses? ""You've left them on the kitchen table."""
That's probably what they'll say.
I am like my mother.
Are you buying that theory?
Don't apologize.
Tom is the one we're looking for.
Do you spend more time with your friends or with your family?
Tom will be upset if he doesn't win.
Tell us everything you know about Tom.
I want you to tell me how to do this.
It's obvious Tom doesn't like Mary.
I told you I have plans.
I'm the same age as you are.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
That doesn't sound too expensive.
I couldn't tell Tom the truth.
How long has it been since you've been home?
Don't you remember what you said?
Tom doesn't like to talk about his past.
Do you think this is fair?
Everyone knows it now.
You and I are the same age.
My mother hasn't slept in 3 days due to her illness.
We sometimes meet them.
What's Tom drawing?
He doesn't play video games.
Tom must have pushed the wrong button.
I think we'd better wait a little longer.
I didn't even receive one letter from her.
I hate alarm clocks.
The museum's eastern gallery was closed for cleaning.
Tom loosened his tie.
Let's do that after school.
I knew I was being photographed.
I don't think Tom is stupid.
Tom needs us.
Tom is leaving next year.
Don't tell on me.
Tom was bitten by a dog.
Tom doesn't share Mary's enthusiasm.
He's not ready.
I'm afraid I don't agree with you.
I'd like to buy a refrigerator.
Do you know whether Tom can speak French?
Tom was happy about that.
"I may not know a lot, but I do know that Tom doesn't know what he's talking about."
Why were you asking me all those questions about Tom?
Who are your enemies?
I want you to come home now.
I was nervous.
Tom looked familiar to Mary.
Please let us know.
You'll soon learn the truth.
Put your pants on.
Tie the horse to that tree.
What time is supper?
That brown hat is old.
They talked together like old friends.
I dare you to prove me wrong.
Is she your sister?
Tom let me go.
Tom paid for the tickets.
He has two Picassos.
She had long hair last year.
They've released Tom.
Does Tom still live with his parents?
I'm waiting for an explanation.
Tom asked what you're doing.
Tom deserves it.
"Hey, wait up."
Beer sales are up.
Tom's favorite color is blue.
I thought you spoke French.
Do you think you could fall in love with me?
"The last I heard, Tom and Mary are still married."
Tom pricked the balloon with a pin.
We have to take care of our children.
I'm going to give it to you.
You're ready.
The earthquake triggered a powerful tsunami.
Someone screamed.
Tom managed to run away.
"One of the children is studying, but the others are playing."
I'd be happy if you'd come.
It looks like everyone has left.
This one is different.
These cars are ours.
The escaped prisoner hasn't been caught.
Even my mom knows it.
Can I see that one?
She was raised by her grandmother.
Let's hope he's all right.
He'll probably win in the next election.
Wait for me downstairs.
How come you're working so late?
This job will take twice as long as I expected.
Tom doesn't often make mistakes.
Let's be silent.
I can understand your point of view.
I wasn't able to find a job.
"Besides being a surgeon, he was a famous writer."
I didn't know Tom at that time.
Tom and Mary sat on the bench.
"When advice will no longer help, nothing will."
Is this cool?
I know that you're coming.
Tell us where to go.
Does it snow in Boston?
She doesn't want him to pick the flowers.
Aren't you even going to ask me where I was?
This book was new.
You should go to a dentist immediately.
I know you were right.
Tom was feeling pretty tired.
Am I stupid?
Is Tom going to leave today?
Don't give me that.
It's been a while since I've eaten fish.
I'm feeling dizzy.
"No matter what you say, I'll do it my way."
I think nobody's home.
It happens every day all over the world.
"I'm young, but I'm not stupid."
Tom is rarely late.
Do you know the reason I came here?
I can't speak French.
The hockey referee intervened to stop the fight.
I don't know exactly when I'll be back.
He's a bad liar.
Tom called to say he wouldn't be at today's meeting.
Tom had no idea who you were.
I wanted to impress you.
I don't have time to do that today.
Mary is blackmailing Tom.
I know Tom has a girlfriend.
I live by myself.
Don't worry about this.
My sister has a very good brain.
Let me think it over for a couple of days.
I knew that Tom wouldn't be able to win.
We don't know yet.
You have no choice.
I was indiscreet.
That's absolutely right.
I'm tired now.
The first stage is complete.
Where did you get that sweater?
Would you mind if I open the window?
I've already done what you asked me to do.
Am I really sick?
The population of Osaka City is larger than that of Kyoto City.
My father works at the factory.
We mustn't be late.
How can you be so cynical?
Tom is deceitful.
She passed the examination with ease.
Tom slipped and fell in the shower.
I hear you bought a house near here.
"If it were true, what would you do?"
Tom quickly put out the fire.
Tom told me Mary quit smoking.
"Wow, what a surprise!"
I just hope it makes it in time.
Why do you think that?
Nobody laughed.
Who's got questions?
I went to Boston alone.
We need some ice.
I don't know what Tom's talking about.
I don't know whether to turn left or right.
Tom is by no means stupid.
I'm writing another story.
A new kind of bullet had been invented.
That's not what I'm saying.
Mary is a very beautiful woman.
Did you catch that fish yourself?
"I disagree with you, Tom."
There is a marked difference between them.
I don't want Tom to be angry.
We can't get close to the enemy.
I don't think it was fair.
I told Tom he had to do that.
Give it a try.
We'll try to get there as soon as possible.
The storm raged for a few days.
You're the only one to survive the attack.
Get upstairs.
Tom pointed at the security camera.
We soundproofed our basement and use it as a recording studio.
Can I join the team?
If we go this way we'll catch up with them.
She gave me a fake phone number.
Can you hear?
I'll be here waiting for you.
I couldn't sleep.
Are you going to eat that bread?
"That isn't yours, is it?"
Tom is a wonderful young man.
We've done everything we could.
How're you holding up?
Tom wasn't born blind.
What exactly do you want me to buy?
Who are you hiding from?
Did you sing?
Tom became a police officer.
May I use your eraser? I seem to have lost mine.
They aren't going to help you.
They said he was the best writer in the group.
Tom may be under thirty.
I couldn't look at it any longer.
The country needs your help.
Didn't you know Tom is good at cooking?
The boat is sinking.
Tom is a good detective.
I can't explain that.
I go to the library at least once a week.
The unrest lasted three days.
I can imagine how you felt.
She's been sick since last Wednesday.
Tom is insane.
"You've been to Boston, haven't you?"
I want you to do this.
I shouldn't have said that.
Where's my order?
Did you know Tom used to live in Boston?
May I visit an art gallery?
Her beauty is incomparable.
A taxi from the airport costs about $30.
You've got to be more aggressive.
Are you sure there's no solution?
Tom tried to prevent that from happening.
He decided to have the operation.
Don't force Tom to eat.
Where are you going to live?
Tom finally had to retire.
It's boring to stay at home.
Tom and Mary started talking at the same time.
Do you remember what time you woke up this morning?
The explorers continued their journey.
I'm heading back home.
We will let him try.
"You told Tom not to talk to me, didn't you?"
What time do you plan to be home tonight?
Throw it away.
I told Tom to never see my sister again.
I understand how difficult this is for you.
I guess I'd better leave.
"What are you doing, Dad?"
I'm helping people to buy things online.
It came out of nowhere.
I didn't know that you could do that.
You like elephants.
"There were no customers, so we closed the shop early."
He has been studying French for eight years.
Tom doesn't take criticism well.
"I want to tell you something, but it's a secret. Promise not to tell."
Do you want to talk about something?
"Apparently, Tom has been cheating on his wife."
Tom has accepted our offer.
I can't find the word to express what I feel.
Tom almost never walks anywhere.
I thought we already did that.
Is there something you wanted to tell me?
What can you do now?
"Anything might happen, so be careful."
Tell Tom there's no need to hurry.
You just rest.
What I want is is a little peace and quiet.
What other way is there to do this?
I like this color.
Get me some wine.
We'll have to do this ourselves.
Your parents are older than mine.
It was dark.
You're the only one who can do that.
"It's a dog, not a toy."
Tom has a slight cold.
Tom made Mary go first.
I just want to say I love you.
You have no right to be here.
Tom is trying on a coat.
I'm bilingual.
Tom has a new job.
She says she will call you later.
Where did Tom get all this stuff?
I saw a mouse.
Yesterday it rained all day.
"If you're tired of arguing with strangers on the Internet, try talking with one of them in real life."
Tom has lost face.
I'm a single parent.
Why does it take them so long to set up my internet connection?
I wrote it for Tom.
I know Tom better than Mary does.
Don't use this bathroom.
Not a soul was to be seen in the town.
Let's wait here until she comes back.
What do you want to study?
He looked her in the eyes.
It looks delicious.
Everyone knows that it was Tom who did that.
Tom doesn't have any pets.
I like spending time with my friends.
Do you want to hear my theory?
Tom almost always wins.
Tom wasn't right about that.
I don't think that my life is easy.
There's nothing else we have to do.
Tom surprised me.
We didn't do a thing.
Tom has already phoned me three times today.
I made you a ham sandwich.
She left with her friends.
I need new soles on these shoes.
Can I call my friend in Australia?
Do you often have to do that?
Excuse me. What's your name?
"You're not afraid, are you?"
"Tom wants to leave, but he can't."
He did not like her manner of speech.
This is too easy for Tom.
That's his private website.
Which book did you read?
I spent my vacation in Australia.
It was dark green.
I won't pay for that.
"Tom is working as a waiter, but he's looking for a better job."
You probably don't remember me.
I can verify that.
There are only two correct answers.
"Between you and me, I'm going to quit my present job soon."
I'll go for a walk if the weather improves.
Tom is the one who wrote this story.
Father told me to wash the car.
I was going to take a nap.
Nobody understands it.
I didn't know Tom was sleepy.
Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System.
We rented a truck to move our furniture.
I saw Tom dancing with another girl.
I am staying with a friend.
If only he had known!
It wasn't found.
I've already finished reading this book.
Can't you peel an orange?
Are you very hungry?
You've got a nice smile.
I've corrected the mistake.
What time do you arrive tomorrow?
Tom locked the doors.
I have a cousin who lives in Boston.
I never counted on his being rich.
Is that all you have to do?
Tom was just lucky.
Tom swears he's innocent.
Hey. What's going on?
I am full.
The body was burned beyond recognition.
Please forgive me for opening your letter by mistake.
They were cowards.
That's how I solve problems.
Tom shut the door behind him.
What's your favorite hair color?
I want to watch this movie.
I have to be in court at 2:30.
I'm glad you came over.
How much of a discount do you think I can get?
She is from France.
Hand me my hat.
Did you have a piano lesson that day?
Did you iron all the shirts?
You're on the right track.
The sky will clear soon.
Tom's letters stopped coming.
You'd better eat now.
When will it happen?
Twelve divided by three is four.
I wasn't interested in the job.
Are you still upset?
Tom is only a little older than Mary.
I haven't told anyone else.
I'm very happy to be back home.
When will I see you again?
You were the best one.
I was a healthy child.
I want to tell you the truth.
I will gladly help you.
I'm going to be there tonight.
It's the first house after you turn the corner.
I know Tom is in Boston right now.
"You are in favor of the plan, aren't you?"
Tom doesn't know what that is.
It never snows in this country.
Tom dated Mary when they were both teenagers.
How old is your oldest son?
Tom said he had no regrets.
Tom told me that Mary had done that.
Tom told Mary he wouldn't go to Boston with her.
Tom didn't know Mary was John's mother.
"What are you doing, Tom?"
I know nothing about Tom.
I didn't have any trouble convincing Tom to go to Boston with me.
Did you foresee this?
Tom sat down next to me.
I got up at seven.
Did you break it?
When was it that Mary bought this skirt?
I don't understand what you're talking about.
They had no chance.
She isn't answering her phone.
She sent him a postcard.
I don't know what time it is.
I'll pray for Tom.
I don't think that Tom will do that today.
Tom talked in his sleep.
Tom is more intelligent than Mary thinks he is.
One language is never enough.
I know that you won't be in Boston next week.
We're just high school students.
She will be back in less than ten minutes.
You'd better not laugh.
Tom won't be able to win again.
I know what you need.
Tell me what happened to Tom.
I wanted to pay.
The hole is big enough.
It wasn't a smart decision.
We can help Tom now.
Is there anything else you would like to say?
I've been looking all over for you.
I can't believe Tom did that to you.
No one ever tells me anything around here.
Has Tom already returned?
Come back.
"You know some French, don't you?"
I won't let them hurt you.
Why don't you want to eat now?
I'm totally free.
You'll like this.
Tom adjusted his tie.
The authorities have contacted Tom.
Is Tom one of your friends?
It's hard for foreigners to learn Japanese.
Go with the flow.
Please pull the rope.
Tom needs to buy a new belt.
It'll be better next time.
They'll never agree to that.
Tom repeated what I said to Mary.
Tom poured a cup of tea for me.
Tom stormed out of the meeting.
I experimented on animals.
A new love is like a new life.
Things didn't go according to plan.
Tom offered Mary his arm.
Cats have nine lives.
How much money do we have left?
Tom's grandmother passed away.
I've never been on a ship.
Tom is smoking a cigarette.
I'm not going to lie.
Tom is obviously tired.
I'd like to eat something light.
I used to be rich.
Is the battery fully charged?
You know who we are.
He knows that you know.
You deserve more than that.
Anybody can do that.
I feel like an outsider.
You can always count on Tom.
Tom waited nearby.
The United States has almost a fourth of the world's prison population.
Why did Tom give you that?
I'm ashamed to ask you such a silly question.
Tom is older than his wife.
Tom is a religious fanatic.
"If you tell me the truth, I'll forgive you."
I haven't paid for the tickets yet.
How old is your boyfriend?
That's exactly what I need to do.
Who stole my keys?
I don't see what any of this has to do with me.
Take it down.
I really wanted to go.
I didn't know that you were a poet.
How many times must I tell you?
Is it true or did Tom make that story up?
That's my favorite band.
Don't think of it.
I heard that Tom is back in town.
Tom didn't know I was Mary's cousin.
I've got one for you.
I don't have time to talk to you now.
I'd like to see the agreement.
We want to go.
They don't speak Spanish.
Is it easy to do that?
I don't think Tom and Mary are married anymore.
You're impulsive.
"If that happened, what would you do?"
Don't say such a thing.
Do you have any French newspapers?
I accompanied her on the piano.
The phone rang.
Let's shake on it.
You can't keep us here.
When are the elections?
I respected you.
Tom took a header down the stairs.
We're already married.
Did you buy a car?
I'm going to cry.
"Drink some coffee. It tastes very good, I think."
Is Tom really guilty?
I have some serious problems.
Tom is in a bad mood this morning.
The majority of the committee were against the plan.
You know I can't tell you that.
I want to know what I need to buy for the party.
I think I lost my keys.
They hugged.
You lucky devil!
I don't think that Tom needs to tell Mary how to do that.
There are too many rules.
Tom could do it.
Don't let the dog out.
I want to kiss Tom.
Tom is in the kitchen helping Mary.
Get some rest.
It's time for you to wake up.
I knew Tom didn't like it.
Tom was charged with drunken driving after he was involved in a car accident in Boston.
Tom showed Mary his passport.
Tom wasn't in the house.
Have you changed anything?
When was the last time that you had a headache?
Tom can't help us now.
I haven't decided yet if I want to go.
What you've done is absolutely inexcusable.
What do you usually wear?
"I was born in Australia, but was brought up in New Zealand."
There are a great number of schools in this city.
I can't tell you.
She advised him not to do that.
How long can Tom stay?
You look like you're tense.
"Go on, sit down."
I don't know what you really want.
Tom didn't answer his phone.
When was the last time you asked somebody for help?
I want to introduce you to Tom.
Tom said he'd also do that.
Can you read French?
I wouldn't mind going someplace else.
You'll be arrested.
I told you Tom wouldn't help.
I tried the coat on.
Where is Tom going to go?
Do you think that you should always tell the truth?
I saw Tom leave the auditorium.
You won't find work here.
We couldn't have done this without your help.
She means more than my life to me.
Smile.
Tell me why you were fired.
Tom can speak French fluently.
I don't even remember that.
Have you already sharpened all the knives?
I would have drowned if you hadn't saved me.
We must've taken the wrong road.
Every woman in the room turned to look at Tom.
She is bound to come here.
Tom sang three songs and then left the stage.
I'm sure today is Monday.
That victory turned the scales in our favor.
Tom said he wanted to buy a horse.
Please send me a postcard.
We trusted Tom.
I thought it was obvious.
Tom is a member of our club.
I can't remember anything from last night.
I still think we should've said yes.
I'd like to go.
I played tennis.
It's been a bad week.
Tom and Mary have a lot in common.
Did you know your door was open?
Tom fed the pigs.
I didn't want Tom to go anywhere without me.
She knows what you did.
I'll never forget what you did for me.
Add a pinch of salt.
I'll need to think about it.
Did you hear my son play the violin?
There's a party at Tom's house tonight.
I don't think Tom heard you.
That's not funny.
Tom tried to remember what Mary had told him.
Take this one.
I invited Tom to go to a movie with me.
Don't ask me for help.
Let me try to explain it to you.
Tom was impressed.
It'll be delivered tomorrow morning.
Don't tell anyone I was here.
Why did you stop me?
Are you free tonight?
Who asked you?
Do you like your sister?
Tom asked me for another glass of water.
The dodo is an already extinct species.
I'm Tom's brother.
Tom was Mary's teacher.
You crossed the line.
You should be ashamed of your ignorance.
"Sooner or later, someone is going to have to tell Tom that he needs to behave himself."
Loosen the screws and remove the lamp cover.
You're almost thirty.
Tom wasn't able to fix the radio.
I have no more money in my wallet.
Tom and Mary are already inside.
This book contains forty photographs.
I'll remember this evening.
I think Tom will be able to help Mary tomorrow.
Do you know whether Tom can speak French?
I needed more time.
You're a really good cook.
I used to drive a truck.
Tom shot Mary with a crossbow.
Can you break a five dollar bill?
Tom wore gloves.
Don't call Tom anymore.
Tom told everyone to sit down.
Sometimes I make mistakes.
I've told you all you need to know.
A DNA test showed he was innocent.
"He is short, but he is strong."
What was the hotel called? I can't remember.
That's just how I am.
I'm not working with Tom anymore.
It just stopped raining.
Do you think your parents spent enough time with you when you were in your teens?
I didn't know you liked dogs.
Try not to get lost.
Is there any salad oil in the bottle?
No doubt you will be able to pass the examination.
You should be more careful next time.
I did some shopping.
I eat Japanese food.
Does Tom want this or not?
How did you learn about what happened here yesterday afternoon?
I have three choices.
Tom told me not to look.
Tom could get sick.
Tom had scratches on his face.
Tom stepped away from the door.
You can go there if you want.
Aspirin can provide quick relief for a headache.
We set up the tent next to the river.
Don't walk home by yourself.
Say hello.
She cremated him against his wishes.
"I forgot, she said."
I had no idea Tom was going to leave me his estate.
Help me to understand.
Tom was so careful.
They were caught smoking.
I know most people here hate me.
What books have you read in French?
She has consented to take the leadership of the party.
Can you count to ten in French?
I'll do it tomorrow.
I sincerely hope that you will soon recover from your illness.
Tom went downtown this afternoon.
Today has been a good day.
Tom invited me.
There's no reason for me to stay.
I wasn't worried.
I expect to be called away soon.
Tom burst into tears.
We're doing this to help Tom.
I was hoping I'd meet you.
I cannot fix the computer.
I hid behind the tree.
That bag is mine.
Tom and Mary will take care of John.
Tom didn't like my idea.
You lost.
He's in bed with the flu.
Bring it home.
Tom gave Mary a bracelet for her birthday.
Nobody was killed.
He doesn't listen.
There's somebody waiting for you in the lobby.
Tell me how to use the washing machine.
Tom has twisted his ankle.
I'm not good enough for you.
He is almost always at home.
Tom didn't think he needed a bodyguard.
My mother is preparing supper.
Tom prepared dinner by himself.
Did Tom believe you?
I wanted to thank you for what you did today.
We don't have a moment to lose.
Tom is at the shopping center.
Tom dragged himself out of bed.
Their oldest sister still hasn't gotten married.
My computer is much newer than yours.
Where is the telephone book?
Ten paper plates cost one dollar.
"I'm sorry, I can't come today."
How long were you and Tom married?
I have a prior engagement.
Breathe in deeply.
I can't do it now.
Is that what Tom meant?
It doesn't look like you're very happy.
Tom has agreed to our proposal.
He tried to concentrate on the letter.
Tom has already given Mary what she wanted.
I couldn't sleep either.
I'm irreplaceable.
You do have a point.
What will be done?
We're trying to impress Tom.
Tom has no allergies.
Is Tom sane?
Tom makes a lot more money than Mary does.
I'm going to take tomorrow off.
That's never going to happen.
Never lose hope.
Tom was drunk and angry.
Feel this. It's really soft.
Tom doesn't want to go anywhere else.
It's been two years since he went Hawaii.
Tom told Mary that he didn't have anything to do.
Meet me at 2:30.
Tom is one of our best detectives.
I will be back by nine.
Do you work alone?
Tom couldn't find his way back.
I will never forgive you.
We plan to visit Boston next spring.
I need to ask you for a favor.
My family means everything to me.
Tom grew up in poverty.
Do you want us to go with you?
You need to decide.
I know what Tom can do.
I'm hungry.
Tom seems to be hungry.
I became his friend.
Are you a religious person?
Tom is lying.
All the characters in this book are imaginary.
I wish you would start calling me Tom.
Call the number I gave you.
You shouldn't smoke.
Iceland is an island.
Tom is thirteen years old.
Save me a piece of cake.
"You're from Australia, right?"
Tom soaked in the bathtub.
Tom has been living in Boston for almost ten years.
All the girls laughed at me.
Try reading this.
I left a note under the door.
Tom was the one who started the fight.
I was very shy when I was a kid.
You live and learn.
Don't pretend you don't know what I mean.
We have to make sure Tom does that.
I hear that he's very rich.
We don't make mistakes.
The doctor did everything he could.
Tom is making too much noise.
What would you like to listen to?
What would happen if Tom did that?
She got her master's degree three years ago.
It got cold after sunset.
What did you hope to find?
Tom and Mary told me that they want to get married.
"I don't believe you, and neither will anyone else."
Tom told me he didn't feel like eating.
It seemed like you weren't interested.
We'll sing.
The police want to question me.
Do you have drinks without alcohol?
Please don't use Facebook during business hours.
Tom's head was spinning.
I saw Tom get on the train.
"Tom always complains, doesn't he?"
"This city is 1,600 meters above sea level."
He forgot his own name.
We are staying at our uncle's.
I don't have a cell phone.
Tom is the only one who has a key.
I can't fire you.
Tom owes me a relatively large sum of money.
I don't think that you should borrow money from Tom.
They both want a child.
Tom was sentenced to 10 years in prison.
You're only three years older than me.
Do you have anything to say regarding this?
I don't think I want to do that.
Tom is a big baby.
Do you have anything to eat?
You put in too much sugar.
Try to find it.
I suspect Tom is sick.
The police have Tom under surveillance.
I thought you said that it was yours.
I am not a witch.
Don't let Tom fool you.
I don't remember her name anymore.
That's not fair.
He is not strong as before.
The new designs are much better than the old ones.
"I'm studying, so I don't have a lot of free time."
How did your day go?
The influence of TV on society is great.
I liked it a lot.
Can't you sing?
Is that reasonable behavior?
Rome was not built in a day.
This is a great apartment.
You've got three minutes.
Tom wanted to look through the telescope.
He looks like a girl.
Tom offered me some orange juice.
We almost never see rabbits around here.
Tom wasn't very friendly.
I've been sentenced to death.
Tom suspected something was wrong.
Don't talk to me while I'm working.
I thought Tom was angry with me.
I think everyone makes mistakes.
"You don't understand me, Tom."
The flu is going around now.
His poor dog is still alive.
Tom is as tall as me.
I saw in the paper that he had returned from the South Pole.
The shop on the corner sells fruit at a very good price.
I met your son yesterday and he greeted me politely.
I'll pick you up tomorrow evening at 6:30.
Tom needs to stay in bed if he wants to recuperate.
I've got a lot to learn from you.
He cannot play guitar.
Tom is taking a nap on the couch.
Tom said no.
Tom was a model inmate.
Aren't you sleepy yet?
Tom is standing on the table to change a lightbulb.
It wasn't intentional.
I'd like to help you if I can.
I can't even think about it.
I'm kind of uncomfortable.
Did Tom succeed?
"The road is icy, so please be careful."
Are they still here?
Tom gave his three-year-old son a puppy for Christmas.
What sort of person are you?
About how many books do you own?
I'm crazy about you.
That's what I got.
Take a look at yourself.
When did Tom go?
We have to tell Tom about this.
It's not as crazy as it sounds.
Tom shot Mary with a speargun.
I need some sleep.
My keys are missing.
I'm happy that you were able to find a job so quickly.
Don't forget to write the zip code.
Why do I even bother?
Tom told me that.
I missed the first part of the concert.
Get rid of the gun.
Someone came ten minutes ago.
Do you have a child?
You said we'd never catch Tom.
I think I know why.
He is worthy to be captain of our team.
Do you want to tell me about it?
We're still analyzing the remaining data.
They're not here.
Promise me you won't tell anyone.
I hope I get a chance to go to Boston.
I don't think Tom would like Australia.
They avoided each other for days.
That seems weird.
I hope Tom tells us what happened.
Let's pretend we didn't hear that.
Does Tom win often?
You won't get there on time.
"As soon as I've finished doing that, I'll help you."
No one cheated.
Tom can't eat this.
Why are we running?
Who do you think can help us?
I didn't want to move here.
We shouldn't have told Tom.
Mary has just come home.
"Tom is just trying to be romantic, isn't he?"
Tom told Mary to shut up.
I've already taken out the trash.
Are you sure you don't know Tom?
It seems that Tom is sick.
I was born here in Australia.
Mary is Tom's stepsister.
I don't think that Tom has a girlfriend.
Will you hire me?
That's what I wanted to tell you.
He doesn't have any real friends.
Did anyone force you to do that?
Tom won't give in.
Tom says he's feeling a lot better.
I know Tom is usually punctual.
Tom learned to drive when he was eighteen.
She really wants to go.
Don't tell me you didn't hear that.
We're closer than we've ever been.
Tom has offered no apologies.
It rarely snows in this area.
I'm going to cancel the meeting.
Give me your keys.
"It's a hard, dirty job."
You look scared.
Give me the knife and let me slice the bread.
Tom can't live without Mary.
You don't need to wait for me.
Tom was my roommate last year.
Tom leaned down to kiss Mary.
What's happening to us?
I know you don't care about Tom.
I'm only thirteen.
Don't expect anyone to help you.
Is there a special rate for this tour?
He's never been in love before.
You know I can't wait any more.
Tom has called an ambulance.
I would like to eat sushi.
She stood up to answer the phone.
Who do you think she is?
No wonder he was arrested.
When does Tom arrive?
I was kind of irritated.
I don't have Internet access.
I've got to get back into shape.
How was Boston?
Tom reached for a dictionary that was on the very top of the shelf.
You have the same racket as I have.
I don't recognize them.
I see a boy.
I'm at the airport now.
Tell me where you were last night.
What is your hobby?
Tom knows all about that.
She told him to stop.
He left the house at eight o'clock.
Tell me where you're going.
I'm diligent.
"In those days, I went to bed earlier."
The printer doesn't work.
This problem can't be solved with money.
Tom doesn't know how to do it.
Tom always finds fault with her.
You know your rights.
We'll all be dead in thirty years.
I think I'm going to go home.
I don't really want to talk to you.
Spain is the host country for the Olympics in 1992.
Tom didn't need to paint the fence. They tore it down a week after he painted it.
Tom attached a string to the kite.
Baseball season has begun.
I am glad to meet you.
My grandfather is very healthy.
I liked Tom's first book more than the second.
I would like to tell you something.
Who did you give it to?
Smoking is prohibited in this restaurant.
I didn't promise Tom anything.
I never said any of that.
Do you like tea?
I thought that you said Tom needed more time.
Tom asked the doctor about Mary.
Was anybody else absent?
Carrying out the plan was easy.
I wasn't expecting Tom to come.
You're too naive.
Tom bought a one-way ticket.
Perhaps it will snow tomorrow.
"Who runs faster, Tom or Mary?"
Do they like you?
Where can I do some shopping?
I have a report to write.
Tom and Mary got divorced.
It looks like you're trying to hide something.
Do you think Tom is dangerous?
It won't be hard.
I try to never make the same mistake twice.
Tom isn't likely to get married.
He attended the meeting as the company representative.
I think the job is done.
Should I give the signal?
I haven't finished the report yet.
Kill Tom.
Was Tom the one who suggested this?
How was your test?
I told Tom to wait over there.
I let you catch me.
You don't have to go there.
Wait inside the car.
Can I open the window?
The result will satisfy him.
Tom came to help.
Does the apartment have a balcony?
I know what you know.
Predators always prey on unsuspecting victims.
Call me if something happens.
Tom lost all his money.
I am very hungry.
Don't forget to say thank you.
I'm surprised by her lack of responsability.
Let's wait a while.
It's good that you were there.
I'm two years younger than he is.
He warmed his hands.
She doesn't have many friends.
What have you eaten today?
She's fond of taking pictures.
Can we talk about this tomorrow?
See you tomorrow at school.
Do not forget to turn the light off before you go to bed.
Speak quietly.
I thought you were a French teacher.
I thought you said you couldn't speak French.
Tom is ignoring Mary.
The Rosetta Stone was found in 1799.
I think Tom will swim.
She hugged her parents before she left.
I know Tom wants to make Mary happy.
How long will Tom be gone?
Tom handed Mary the photo.
I couldn't go to your birthday party.
Everyone in the room laughed.
They're cannibals.
I think that Tom is alone in his room.
I would've bought it.
It isn't likely that Tom will shed any tears if Mary gets fired.
I often watch the news while eating dinner.
How did you get acquainted with her?
How can I get to the airport?
Thank you for taking care of my dog.
I share a room with my brother.
It wasn't good.
I'll show Tom how to do that.
You don't need alcohol to be happy.
Why did you go away?
Could you get in touch with him?
Tom studies biology.
Call off your dogs.
You're not the first to suggest that.
Tom would like to speak to you in private.
The axle is broken.
I'm not in the least afraid of it.
I just saw an opossum.
The table is made of wood.
I used to dream about being a ballerina.
Maybe we should ask someone for directions.
They say there are ghosts in this old house.
I got arrested.
I think you're a good father.
"He was ill, so he lay in bed all day long."
He lost a book.
Tom said that he wasn't going to help us.
My daughter has reached a marriageable age.
Tom bought a very cheap camera.
Are you sure you want to throw that away?
We'll leave.
Did you warn Tom?
Tom knows we believe him.
Anybody is better than nobody.
I'll see you this afternoon.
I didn't even notice what Tom was wearing.
Could you stay a little longer?
I wonder what will happen.
We can give it one more try.
I read your letter to my family.
Tom almost never makes a mistake.
Did you arrest Tom?
That's just what I need right now.
Tom mentioned your name.
Tom and Mary went on a camping trip.
Don't forget that Tom is my brother.
Were you the one who chose this?
We have to evacuate the building.
"By the way, what time will you go there?"
Does the store you're going to sell rice?
Find out who they are.
We stole it.
Don't throw it away just because it's broken.
Tom wants this one.
Tom said it was more harder than he expected.
Mary isn't really sick. She's just faking it.
Don't exaggerate.
Tom will unlikely want to go anywhere with Mary.
I don't care what you wear.
Tom has a heavy workload.
Don't try to bribe me.
I suppose it's possible.
It's lost.
A lie is often easier to believe than the truth.
They took a sample of my blood at the hospital.
They gathered at a farm in New York State.
I just got out of the shower.
I don't want to let my team down.
There's no question Tom will do that.
This is all my fault.
Tom used to be outspoken.
That was yours.
I knew Tom was going to win.
"You know where to find it, don't you?"
I met Tom and Mary just the other day.
I found out what's wrong with the car.
Tom probably shouldn't tell Mary how he did that.
Tom and I lied to you.
I never should've trusted Tom.
I swear to you I will never do it again.
What did his wife say?
Tom bought a coat.
You seem very nervous.
Is it my turn to pay?
Is that what Tom would want?
Don't open it.
How do you decorate your house for Christmas?
This one is for us.
Do I have to go right now?
I talked to my friend in the FBI.
I don't think Tom knows where he is.
I'll talk with you about that later.
You're being paranoid.
A ball is floating down the river.
Why do you need my help?
I knew your brother.
You're funny.
You're completely healthy.
The hero finally defeated the evil scientist.
Who's here?
This letter isn't addressed to you.
Tom was wearing a straw hat and sunglasses.
I'm going to Australia this month.
I don't remember what happened anymore.
"Stand up, please."
It's doubtful that anything will grow here.
"Tom pretended to be sick, so he wouldn't have to go to school."
I'm a soldier.
Tom isn't as good a golfer as he says he is.
Give me a little more time.
Stay in your room.
You aren't Canadian.
You have to see this.
Tom is a very good friend.
I forgot my purse.
I hope he'll be able to come! I'd like to see him.
She sent me an urgent telegram.
I promise not to disappoint you.
I confessed to stealing the money.
Tom wrote Mary a long love letter.
Whales are mammals.
Tom met Mary while he was in Australia.
I got out of the bathtub.
I thought that my head would explode.
Tom is approximately the same age as me.
I should have said something.
Tom pawned his wedding ring.
"Do you speak French? ""Not very well."""
Tom wouldn't let Mary do what she wanted to do.
It took a whole day to paint the picture.
I think you know that we need to do that.
"You have wanted to go there for a long time, haven't you?"
They lost their property.
I didn't believe him at first.
Your room must always be kept clean.
Tom is outside playing frisbee with his dog.
Aren't you pleased?
"My mother went shopping, didn't she?"
I need a larger room.
That's new.
"Tom isn't Mary's father, but her uncle."
Tom likes oranges.
Tom told me you were upset.
I'd help if Tom wanted me to.
"By the way, where is Tom?"
Do you remember how to do this?
The prince was lost in the woods.
I'll be all paid up after one more installment.
The students assembled in the classroom.
Tom doesn't usually watch this kind of movie.
Do you think that was fair?
Do I have to decide right now?
Put the words in alphabetical order.
How many bus stops are there to the center?
Tom doesn't know what's in this box.
Tom and Mary voted for John.
Bees provide us with honey.
I think Tom was lied to.
I've forgotten my password.
Tom thinks Mary doesn't get enough sleep.
Do you think it was Tom who did that?
You can tell what a person is like by looking at his friends.
I dropped my phone.
I'm sorry I broke my promise.
My friend is studying Korean.
You are crazy.
Tom cut school.
Why was Tom crying?
I feel sad.
Don't worry so much.
Stay with us for a few days.
I think you mentioned that last week.
I'm at the police station.
I'm happy to be back.
That might have been true.
We're going to change that.
The door was half open.
I told Tom to ask Mary.
You said you wanted to go.
Tom said that Mary taught French.
All plants need water and light.
All sorts of people live in Tokyo.
Tom was wearing jeans and a T-shirt.
What have you got there in your pocket?
I think Tom will do as he's told.
I told Tom he should learn how to swim.
I don't know why you're here.
"Tom, are these books all yours?"
Tom wanted to surprise Mary.
This is outrageous!
Tom is the only one who knows where Mary lives.
I have to go shopping. I'll be back in an hour.
She always gets up early.
Who is the boss here?
How do you know about that?
Tom will be happy to see you again.
Why did you lie to us?
I was at your wedding.
I don't know if there's time.
I really want to kiss you again.
Tom had a near-death experience.
Tom needs someone he can discuss his problems with.
I envy you.
It looks like Tom is angry.
Has anybody spoken with you?
Our garden has two cherry trees.
We tried everything.
I should have followed Tom's advice.
I didn't know whether we should do that or not.
Do you plan on doing that?
That night was very cold.
Tom helped rescue Mary.
What you said makes absolutely no sense to me.
Is Tom injured?
Put the shovel down.
Tom says he comes here every year.
Throw me that rope.
Where did you buy these towels?
That's all I wanted.
I am going to the post office to buy stamps.
Just take one swallow of this medicine.
Are you going to record today's episode?
I bought two bottles of milk.
Tom is the one who recommended this book.
It is said that his father died in a foreign country.
I'm not very athletic.
Do you have any pictures of Tom when he was a kid?
How has that helped you in this job?
You've lost too much blood.
"If you want to lose weight, you'll have to be careful about what you eat."
Tell us how we may help you.
Are you sure everything is OK?
It was on the list.
I'm busy on Monday.
What could be more important than this?
Tom lived on Park Street.
Tom belonged to a religious order.
Do you have any plans for tomorrow?
Tom will go in your place.
Which subject do you like best?
Did you say anything to Tom about that?
"Tom is an honest boy, so he wouldn't tell a lie."
When do you shop?
What else could it mean?
Do you know the groom?
"I didn't tell anyone, not even my mother."
Tom wiped his nose on his sleeve.
Tom is a 33-year-old man.
We want to know why Tom did it.
I told Tom what had to be done.
The hotel was designed by a Japanese architect.
"If you can't come, we'll understand."
The pen I lost yesterday was a new one.
I want to go home.
Did you really say that?
You have no authority to do that.
There's nowhere for you to hide.
I knew Tom wasn't as old as Mary.
Sometimes it's great to spend some time alone.
What's in your closet?
We think you should go to Boston.
Am I on that list?
Would you trust them?
Good job!
Have dinner with us.
I can't go with you on Monday.
Tom only does that on Monday.
Tom wasn't wearing a uniform.
"His name was on the tip of my tongue, but I couldn't remember it."
Tom stopped moving.
"If Tom finds out I told you this, he'll kill me."
It's best to get to the airport a couple of hours before your flight.
You have to get enough sleep.
Did you bring a hair dryer?
I wonder whether Tom likes Boston.
The old man freed the little fox from the trap.
Tom parked his car in front of Mary's house.
My life has been changed.
I bet you didn't know this.
I don't think it's dangerous.
Did I hurt his feelings?
Just check it.
We don't believe so.
I hope that you will like it.
Don't eat so fast.
You're very perceptive.
I know that Tom doesn't like cats.
I broke my arm.
The murderer is still at large.
I risked everything.
Ignorance is bliss.
You're still here.
That's what makes it so difficult.
I've been wanting to ask you out for a long time.
We lost the game.
The bread is in the oven.
Tom has enough money to buy everything he needs.
Tom wants to learn how to play bridge.
I appreciate everything you've done.
She will give birth in July.
The rich really are different from you and me.
Don't you have anything to say?
I agree with you to a degree.
Who told you to go home?
That guy's name was Tom.
Tom probably knows the answer.
I spent the whole night trying to fall asleep.
She's at the hotel now.
The soup needs more garlic.
I'll wait and see what happens.
You're impulsive.
Nobody ever comes to visit us.
Promise me you won't make fun of me.
It's completely irrational.
I don't go to church.
Thanks for pointing out the obvious.
He aimed at the bird.
Tom thought Mary despised John.
The company manufactures a variety of paper goods.
I'll never speak to you again.
I think that Tom is homesick.
I brought you another blanket.
I didn't do anything bad.
What's your feeling about the idea?
I have some more questions.
The problem is not worth consideration.
Mary bought a fake Louis Vuitton handbag in Hong Kong.
I suggest we get started.
I will wait until she comes.
You're always in Boston.
It's obviously a bluff.
We've missed you.
Tom likes both singing and dancing.
I can't help you because I'm busy.
Why doesn't Tom pay any attention to me?
Tom said that Mary cried.
Tom suggested to Mary that she apologize to John.
Tom doesn't do that kind of thing.
Tom was last on the list.
These are Tom's glasses.
Take this one.
We can take them.
I'll take the next bus.
Tom will replace Mary.
What are you knitting?
How can you eat so much?
What a big eater he is!
Tom doesn't go to church very often.
I need a helmet.
The surface of the earth is 70% water.
Should I cut the red wire or the green one?
How's the patient feeling this morning?
Tom is picking his nose.
It's pretty interesting.
We were wakened by the whistle of the steam locomotive at dawn.
Tell me about what happened.
Mary is wearing a short skirt today.
I'm a medic.
This story is true.
Mary is an ambitious young woman.
I remembered everybody.
You won't believe what happened.
I know now.
Tom gets headaches.
Tom wanted to go to the movies.
It had never occurred to her that he would be punished.
He smiled and said goodbye.
Our school is 80 years old.
I heard you tell Tom not to sing.
Tom is very organized.
I want to go swimming with Tom.
Write your goals down.
Certain things are better left unsaid.
I was surprised by what I learned.
Tom was arrested the same day.
Tom managed to save Mary.
"You can dance, can't you?"
Tom is surrounded by beautiful women.
Nobody deserves to die like that.
Have you ever sold a car?
I don't even know if Tom has a girlfriend or not.
Tom did it just to impress Mary.
How many books did you read last month?
Do you think Tom will be absent?
I came very early.
It isn't cheap.
Tom told Mary he understood French.
I'll give this to Tom tomorrow.
Would you rather be healthy or wealthy?
Wait somewhere else.
She advised him to come by 2:30.
I told Tom that I agreed with him.
It was in this box.
We went too far.
Tom agreed right away.
I can run very fast.
"Let's go, Tom."
I'm ruthless.
I'm not your assistant anymore.
We know what you want.
Tom said he wanted to leave.
I told Tom to stop.
This possibility cannot be ruled out.
I made an apple pie for dessert.
I think that Tom told you the truth.
I need you to talk to Tom about that.
I don't like it either.
Tom got more than he needed.
Tom knows that you're a Canadian.
Isn't there anything we can do?
Let me see your health insurance certificate.
Tom hit me twice.
What right do you have to order us around?
Tom sleeps on a sofa that converts into a bed.
Compass needles point to the north.
I don't know much about fishing.
We're going to need a loan.
Somebody told me you had a boyfriend.
How do you know that they're looking for us?
Mary has never ever been asked out on a date.
We'll deal with it.
Do as I say.
"Tom bought a Swiss knife for me, but customs seized it."
I'm going to do that for you.
Tom showed me Mary's picture.
Tom shut off the engine.
I knew it was time to go.
"You don't know Tom's brother, do you?"
Someone's singing.
I don't think Tom is old enough to drive.
Did you help Tom?
Save Tom.
I'm very angry.
I scarcely believed my eyes.
"Hey, listen to me."
You are kidding me.
Tom is working at the garage.
I should get in touch with Tom.
Stay out of the rain.
There's a crown here.
I think I'm dying.
I'm sorry I had to leave you alone.
Did anybody tell you anything about it?
Did I give you enough money?
Why didn't you tell Tom it was my fault?
You know where Tom is.
I hope you like spicy food.
I don't want to be the person who tells Tom that.
Are you for or against this?
You know that I can do it.
I don't understand a thing.
I suspect that Tom got what he wanted.
The boy ran away without looking back.
She put all her jewels into a little red box.
Tom moved here from Australia in 2013.
Have you lost weight?
"Tom is lying in bed, asleep."
I just want to be a normal person.
Boston is beautiful.
I'll speak to you at a more convenient time.
I want everybody to know I'm not a murderer.
I know we'll be able to do that.
Will these wounds heal?
You could help us.
I thought this might happen.
He is rarely in a good mood.
Who let you in here?
He is anxious about her health.
Look there.
Now I'm ready for anything.
We'll stay here until Monday.
Tom has to look after Mary.
You're the scapegoat.
Venice is one of the world's most romantic cities.
Wash up.
I rely on you and Tom.
Some soft drinks have very high sugar content and can cause obesity and tooth decay if consumed to excess.
Tom has chosen you.
I talked to my friends about it.
French is difficult.
It's too hard for me.
I'm not home on Sundays.
This detergent works like magic.
I thought that sounded good.
Aren't you Catholic?
Did Tom say anything about what happened?
"So, what are we going to do?"
I felt lonely without her.
You look like you're tired.
I thought you told me you did that.
Where are you going?
I've never done harm to anyone.
Please open this can.
"Mary, I love you."
It was very hard to say that.
"While reading a book, I fell asleep."
I wonder if it's true.
I thought you were Canadian.
Stop grumbling.
How can I lose weight?
Tom swims as well as Mary.
You never listen to our advice.
All my friends call me Tom.
We won't have to wait long.
I know you want to be beautiful.
What're we looking for?
This is my new car.
I'm a tattoo artist.
I know it's my fault.
Tom is insanely jealous.
I wouldn't count on it.
We are hoping to visit Spain this summer.
You can't run from the past.
Where did Tom do that?
Everyone was looking for you.
Do you know that man?
Did I fall asleep?
I'd like to stay here.
The tea is too strong. Add a bit of water.
Tom said he thought it would be a big mistake to tell Mary what had happened.
Tom is much older than I thought.
"Fortunately, they were able to escape."
I'm glad someone told me.
Did you enjoy the movie you saw last night?
What do you think Tom would've done in that situation?
I don't like living alone.
The United Nations sent peacekeepers to Bosnia.
I only plan to do what I have to do.
They lived in Boston.
Why do they do this?
Mariah Carey's greatest gift is her voice.
I didn't know Tom was drunk.
I remember having seen this movie before.
Tom has been kind to me.
Deal the cards.
When are you going to return from Boston?
I wanted to participate.
Are there other options?
Tom helped me to get changed.
I had never seen anything like that before.
Tom works on Park Street.
The kite got caught in the tree.
I couldn't sleep either.
I think we can avoid that.
Let's try something else.
I got off the train.
"If I had time to do that, I would."
I hope Tom has a good home now.
I think you'll be surprised.
Tom wanted everybody to go home.
Tom is rich enough to buy whatever he wants.
Did they tell you who I was?
I'm beginning to get hungry.
How many times have I told you not to help Tom?
She cleared off the table.
It's already been ten years since my father passed away.
My boyfriend thinks I'm crazy.
Did you find it?
I suppose I ought to apologize.
Women didn't use to talk politics in this country.
I'll have a nap after lunch.
Is it too salty?
The bus Tom was on was involved in an accident.
Which group do you want to join?
I don't know what you mean.
I must study.
He knows many amusing magic tricks.
Give me the car keys.
Did you fall asleep?
Which of these rackets is yours?
Tom has a cousin named Mary.
Why are you angry?
"Not knowing what to do, I called my mother for advice."
Tom has a meeting this morning.
I'd like to avoid this problem in the future.
Everybody was surprised.
Did you tickle Tom?
Tom lived a hard life.
You may take the book.
How can I delete photos from my iPad?
We've seen her.
You drive too fast.
I looked for a job.
You have to see this movie.
Did you get the message?
I hear you bought a house near here.
It looks like it'll rain today.
You and I are very good friends.
Why didn't you call somebody?
I thought you said you hated that.
You don't have to go there.
Tom was at school when Mary called him.
Tom ran outside half-naked.
Was that how it happened?
What time did you go to bed yesterday?
I have never skipped a class.
I'm doing this for them.
"I called your office today, but you weren't in."
Tom meant that.
Who swam?
"He isn't rich, but he's happy."
Tom smelled gas.
I can't go on Monday.
She tried to make both ends meet.
I don't think Tom was happy.
Tom always sits in the back.
You're much taller than Tom.
Tom and I are in Boston.
What's ours is ours.
Call my husband.
I didn't think that was possible.
I shouldn't have done that without your permission.
We want respect.
This job isn't as easy as it looks.
She studied hard in order not to fail the entrance exam.
We have a little surprise for you.
"If he's still alive, he'd be very old by now."
This may be a trap.
He told him to study.
Are you ready for today's meeting?
Tom is at school right now.
It would be better for you not to do that.
I bought this for Tom.
The stitches on the blanket have unraveled.
Would you join me for a walk?
She divorced him.
I want you to study French.
This word has two meanings.
I don't even know you.
They have access to the library.
Be home by half past six.
I saw her at the station.
She liked it.
I'd be grateful.
What exactly do you want me to do?
My fate is sealed.
Do you think Tom killed Mary?
Was that so bad?
I am so sick.
"If you don't do that, someone else will."
I've already promised not to do that.
I don't know what else to try.
She wasn't helping her mother.
She was falsely accused.
Tom is recruiting new workers.
Did you hear the roar of the lions?
I'd like to try.
This coffee is too hot to drink.
Your necklace is beautiful.
Does the smoke bother you?
Who found this?
My girlfriend is from Boston.
Who's the best person for the job?
He has only six months to live.
Tom will follow you.
May I ask why it is that you don't want to talk about it?
Tom said this to me.
A person who chases two rabbits won't catch either.
Do you want to watch a movie?
See that Tom stays in bed.
Who's your favorite super hero?
Do you want to try it on?
I could tell you who did it.
There's a run in your stocking.
Tom took the job that Mary offered him.
We haven't begun yet.
I'd do it again.
Tom needs advice.
I'm glad Tom did it.
My car is over there.
I have many photos.
Have you told Tom that we're married?
Tom is the one who was here last week.
I still have a lot to learn.
Tom told me that he didn't want to eat any more.
His girlfriend has lost weight.
Tom was in the mountains.
Tom is very modest.
Do you know where the meeting will be?
Tom knew it would be hard to win.
Do you have change for a dollar?
Let's talk about that later.
You didn't tell me Tom speaks French.
Are you sure you don't want to swim with us?
It's clear that Tom got on the wrong bus.
I hear Tom was the one who taught you how to play the cello.
"If I send it by air mail, how much will it cost?"
Should I include Tom?
What did Tom take a picture of?
I just want to stay in the car.
You will miss the train.
Tom is hoping to avoid that.
Someone's behind me.
You weren't here then.
Let's spend all weekend together.
You've taught me a lot.
Do Tom and Mary go to the same school?
I'm ready to do that.
The patient is always complaining of a headache.
Is Tom in?
"Since we had no school today, I stayed home and watched TV all day."
They're too big.
I wonder when Tom will go.
Tom filled his glass and then filled one for Mary.
Is the milk good?
You could have drowned.
You will lose.
Do you remember it?
What do you want to do with this?
Tell me how you did that.
She plays the piano very well.
I make €100 a day.
I don't know for certain yet.
What is the price of this cap?
Tom didn't want to die.
You're very sweet.
The Mississippi River is deep and wide.
Would $300 help?
When do you need them?
"Come on Monday afternoon, if possible."
It's a small school. Everyone knows everyone.
My mother will make me a birthday cake.
I don't know much about computers.
What have you gotten us into?
Tom doesn't care about that.
Where exactly are you?
I want to go to Boston with Tom.
I understand now why he didn't go to a university.
I know how persuasive Tom can be.
We have no reason to change our plans.
Tom has lots of property.
Tom has gone back to prison.
I don't want to tell you how I did that.
"Could you turn off the radio, please?"
How is your name spelled?
Stay sharp.
Tears are a child's weapon.
Tom let go of Mary's hand.
They all changed.
I turned the TV off.
I stayed.
Can your wife speak French?
It's for you to decide.
Tom hopes to see you in October.
I often dream about you.
I never should've gone there by myself.
Tom has some things that he needs to do.
She got engaged to him.
Tom wondered what had happened.
Tom likes to take walks in the woods.
How did we win?
I don't understand what you find so interesting about squirrels.
You're a very selfish person.
Why do our schools look like prisons?
The road was closed on account of the flood.
How many daughters does Tom have?
You may choose whichever you like.
I feel lost without you.
I see life differently now.
I'll be here until 2:30.
Mary put her knitting aside and stood up.
I brought you flowers.
Her heart was full of joy.
Are you having problems?
She asked for my help.
Tom wouldn't have lied.
He defeated his opponent in the election.
The restaurant is on the ground floor.
I am grateful to them.
The walls are very thin.
This isn't a handout.
I see fear in your eyes.
People treat me with respect.
Do you mind if I turn on the radio?
That hat is too small for you.
What did you buy from Tom?
Tom doesn't live in Boston now.
She and I are the same age.
I'm not selling the horses.
I didn't know that Tom was younger than you.
There's no paint left.
I guess that's not such a big secret.
"Tom has written a lot of books, but none of them have ever been published."
Have you found what you were looking for?
You don't have to help me.
"You're right, of course."
I came here to warn you that you're in danger.
I think Tom can help Mary.
You're too good to me.
You know very well that I'm right.
These are the simple facts.
I think Tom is going to win.
It's hard to believe that it actually happened.
I'm doing everything I can to help Tom.
My brother helps me with my homework sometimes.
Tom has a son whose name is John.
Could you take off the price tag for me?
I don't think that Tom needs a bodyguard.
Aren't you Tom?
We're very grateful for your hospitality.
What was it made of?
I go to bed at ten as a rule.
"This is the last train, sir."
What is the name of that river?
You need to relax.
You are twice as strong as I am.
Is that why you don't like Tom?
I'm going by bus.
I don't want to forget Tom.
Go wake Tom up and tell him breakfast is ready.
These kinds of mistakes are easy to overlook.
Tom hasn't done much.
Tom has trouble getting along with other people.
I'm too young to do that yet.
It won't be easy for Tom.
Take him away.
Tom is wearing suspenders.
You must learn how to do that.
He wants to get rid of his books.
They'll be fine.
She keeps him at arm's length these days.
Tom doesn't live with his parents anymore.
I climbed to the top of Mt. Fuji.
Tom told me so.
Do you realize what you're asking me to do?
He ordered me to clean the room.
I'm going to kill myself.
They didn't listen.
Tom has a wife and a young child.
Tom should be OK.
I don't want my kids to smoke.
Does anybody here know Tom?
The machine needs oiling.
Where is the bus terminal?
He whistled as he walked.
They hit the target.
Are you coming tonight?
I have absolutely no idea what Tom is doing.
Tom is a very peculiar person.
The policeman took the thief by the arm.
The thief admitted his guilt.
Many young people in Spain are unemployed.
"If you want security in your old age, begin saving now."
That doesn't really answer the question.
This is a good show.
Tom asked a stupid question.
What were you dreaming about?
Tom said you were smart.
Tom took a day off.
Tom won't have to go there anymore.
You seem to be sleepy.
Tom may wear anything he wants.
Turn the key to the right.
You can't go alone.
"My wife will be glad to see you, too."
These don't match.
Tom isn't doing very well in school.
When do you close?
Tom frequently appears on television.
What makes you think Tom won't come?
Tom was on TV yesterday.
The doors were locked.
May I kiss you?
I didn't know you were Canadian.
The scientists analyzed the data.
Did you dream about me last night?
I'm sure that he'll succeed.
There are some things money can't buy.
Tom isn't at school.
Tom is illiterate.
I don't know how long the meeting will last.
Did you see the sunrise this morning?
I'm not going to do that unless you help me.
I was afraid to kiss Tom.
We're ready for the next step.
Am I in love?
It's all right. I can wait.
How long ago did that happen?
We'll be in Boston all week.
I didn't know you'd be alone.
Tom needs to be taken to a hospital.
Mary put on her best dress.
You're all happy.
I wish I knew how to speak French.
Stop pressuring me.
Tom didn't want to throw anything away.
Can you manage alone?
Tom called yesterday morning.
I have good days and bad days.
Do you really think Tom is a spy?
Mary pretended to polish her nails.
Neither Tom nor Mary was fired.
How much are we going to get paid?
The people were evacuated because of the flood.
Copper and silver are both metals.
I knew this would happen.
Tom got up quickly.
I never blamed you.
Tom put the kids to bed.
Didn't you know Tom was living on Park Street?
You don't have to sing if you don't want to.
I need you to bring me something.
Let me know in advance if you are coming.
I don't know who's behind it.
I have to be back by 2:30.
She got him into trouble.
Don't pressure Tom.
Why didn't anybody come?
He called out for help.
The water ran down the rain pipe.
King Solomon was known for his wisdom.
I'm not a member.
Tom hopes he won't be asked to do that.
Eat your soup while it's warm.
A good coach trains this team.
I thought Tom didn't like Mary.
I think everybody's happy.
A truck was standing in the middle of the road.
Can you recommend a good over-the-counter allergy medicine?
I don't know where you are going.
Tom watched the squirrels play.
Tom was partially correct.
We like our apartment.
I want you to do that.
A lot of villagers were killed by soldiers.
May I borrow your calculator?
I keep a gun in my car.
Where are you from?
Tom told Mary that John was his brother.
"For some reason, it's not working."
Can you get up to the roof?
I was glad I was there.
Will you show it to me?
Tom told me about what had happened.
You won't be harmed.
You've got to get up.
Tom is better at the piano than I am.
I know that Tom won the lottery.
I wish he were here.
Tom met Mary while he was in Boston.
Hand in your homework by next Monday.
How long was I out?
He will succeed to the throne.
Tom isn't fit for the job.
Tom has also left.
He is actually not the manager.
I loved Mary so much.
Will you lend me your bicycle for an hour?
We kept in touch.
I thought you were at work.
Why didn't you do that?
The sun is shining in my face.
Come to the party.
The first step is realizing that you have a problem.
I forgot to buy a present.
Tom is going to be late for the concert.
Tom didn't ask me to help.
I wish you were close to me.
Would you like to sing?
I don't have a choice.
Didn't you know I used to live in Australia?
I don't know where Tom works.
I'll get in touch with you next week.
How did you get our address?
Do you mind if I join you?
It's Tom that wants to see you.
He invented the wheel.
Can you come here?
Do you agree with what Tom said?
I answered for him.
I don't think it'll be easy for Tom to do that.
The police drew an outline of a body at the scene of the crime to indicate how the body was lying when it was found.
I hate hospital food.
The hat's hanging on the rack.
I want you to call Tom.
Tell me what's on your mind.
I'll help you clean the house.
"Look, I don't want any trouble."
Tom's younger daughter is married.
You understand us so well.
I can come if you want.
Tom used to be a car salesman.
This is why he got angry with you.
Please tell me what's wrong.
Tom insisted that he was right.
Tom's dog is white.
I thought you wouldn't tell her that we hadn't done our homework.
She's much better today.
I was a witness.
I never deceived you.
Where did you learn to cook like this?
Tom answered the teacher's questions.
He gave me this doll in token of his gratitude.
Tom gave me a few dollars.
Tom admitted that he'd been mistaken.
Tom said he was looking for more volunteers.
I just stopped by to say hello.
A loud knocking at the door woke him up.
How is your sister?
Tom has always been a bachelor.
We were really cold.
Tom has blond hair and green eyes.
We have different values.
I'm a bit tired.
Tom was in a trance.
I find you very attractive.
It's not that far from here.
I'm your French teacher.
I'm tall.
You're the only one to survive the attack.
I would like to know as well.
"Why didn't you tell me? ""You never asked."""
You've already explained that.
Are you ready for tonight?
Stop shooting!
That is a strange sentence.
Good luck on the test!
Tom twisted the truth.
Either day is OK.
I knew Tom wasn't in Australia.
Are you waiting for something?
When did you come back from Boston?
That was a month ago.
It is difficult to translate a poem into another language.
I should've known better.
I'm happy that it's over.
Tom told me you speak French.
Buy yourself something to eat.
Tom forgot to feed Mary's dog.
Tom will be waiting for me.
Tom died this morning at 2:30.
Keep a low profile.
I had to say something.
What time did you leave?
I feel spring in the air.
I'm trying to say something.
How do you know what I heard?
The thieves split up their loot.
How much you want to get paid?
I don't think it's so strange.
Tom is planning to buy that book.
What's up?
We'll help you look for it.
Tom is washing his hands.
Tom is in excellent health.
You don't have to do that now.
I wonder what Tom will tell us.
Tom is a bad influence.
The handle of the cup is broken.
Why are you afraid of Tom?
Is that all you bought?
He must have been ill.
Everyone knows that it worked.
Call the police!
I passed the exam.
Expect no mercy.
You have no one to blame but yourself.
They couldn't swim because of bad weather.
I thought Tom was bluffing.
Tom is bad at sports.
Tom needs to chill.
I won't let anyone hurt Tom.
Is there a cure for stupidity?
He was deprived of his civil rights.
I need to have a word with you.
I tried to warn Tom about that.
My clothes are there.
Why isn't Tom on this list?
I am looking for a good hotel.
I took him at his word.
The Christmas tree was blazing with lights.
I don't think Tom knows about this yet.
I want to move back to Australia.
Today is Thursday.
There is a large hole in the wall.
How old is your sister?
Have you told Tom?
I told Tom that I'd made a mistake.
They became professional soccer players.
How long have you been in Boston?
Isn't Tom with you?
I shouldn't have taken it.
I smell bad.
When do we start?
I heard Tom leaving.
Both Tom and Mary work.
She had long hair last year.
He will come sooner or later.
Your order will be ready within half an hour.
A tall man came up to me.
"Hurry, or you'll miss the train."
Our school has about one thousand students.
Tom saw Mary at the party.
Mary was killed with a fireplace poker.
I burst out laughing.
The fighting lasted about three months.
I'll take it if you don't mind.
Tom is madly in love with Mary.
Nothing's good enough for you.
I hate my roommate.
Tom will call you later.
I got out of bed and turned on the light.
What's under the blanket?
I'm telling you the truth.
I've already finished my homework.
Try to understand this.
We must deal fairly with these people.
Tom hasn't arrived yet.
Tom is still in the bathroom.
We have a colleague in Australia.
I've never seen that before.
Tom looks much younger than he really is.
There's something I'd like to show you.
I can come back later.
This is good for us.
I had my watch stolen yesterday.
Tom will join us later.
Do you believe that good always triumphs over evil?
His sisters are both beautiful.
My house has two bedrooms.
I've got to try.
Tom was as proud as a peacock.
He sometimes comes to see me.
This door leads to the garden.
She didn't resist for long.
Call me if you find something.
Do you like tennis?
I want to move away.
Tom doesn't doubt that Mary has done that.
It's too bright.
That won't solve anything.
He rose to his feet to greet me.
I knew Tom could do that.
We spent about three months in Boston.
Tom refused to leave without Mary.
This one is for us.
I'd like you to meet my sister.
The children were swimming naked.
She has been dead five years.
I'm not completely sure.
I'm not going to wait for Tom any longer.
I got up at six o'clock.
Tom won't be surprised.
Tom hasn't done his homework yet.
Did you take it?
This CD is my son's.
Tom's not answering his cell.
I can always tell when Tom is lying.
How much do you weigh?
I like that one.
One of your neighbors complained.
Drink this juice.
Tom folded the piece of paper in half.
Why does Tom get a higher salary than I do?
Tom missed you.
I don't know who to give this package to.
Is this fish still alive?
We're going to Tom's party.
Do you know why Tom doesn't like Mary?
I'm totally free.
I want to do that again.
"If you want this job, you must apply for it by tomorrow."
Do you know it for a fact?
How often are you here?
I love the way you sing.
Please don't tell Tom about this.
Tom used to tell me stories about Australia.
I want you to deliver this message to Tom.
What a stupid joke!
Wouldn't it be better to eat now?
Do you really think I should marry Tom?
She hard-boiled the eggs.
That's a great poem.
What else will you need?
Why are you telling us this now?
Tom turned the lights off.
Tom took a taxi back home.
Why was everybody yelling at you?
I knew Tom would be able to win.
We'll decide.
Do you recognize me?
I had to go there by myself.
Try breathing through your mouth.
Aren't you ever going to sleep?
This book will change your life.
I don't know anything about cars.
You hurt Tom's feelings.
I didn't ask you to come.
I think this is Tom's house.
Will you forgive me?
Tom is away on business.
Does your dog bite?
The plane was approaching London.
I wasn't sure if I had enough money.
A true friend would not say such a thing.
I know a lot of people who don't like doing that.
Do you have it by any chance?
You may have a slight fever.
How can you be so blind?
Hold my bag.
He introduced his daughter to me.
You'd better go.
I tanned myself on the beach.
Why do I have to eat this?
I have enough money to buy it.
I don't think that it's impossible.
I bought a new fishing rod.
"Tom isn't going to lose, is he?"
Tom didn't get to finish.
I don't really feel like laughing.
Mary made the children breakfast.
I'm efficient.
I think you should wake Tom up.
Has Tom left?
Let's not wait for Tom any longer.
I wish we could live in Boston.
I know Tom is still busy.
What if someone sees it?
The sky is full of stars.
I hope you find it interesting.
Is that all you wanted to tell me?
He was walking toward the sea.
Get off the train at the next station.
I don't want you to think I'm nuts.
I didn't feel anything.
I have no questions.
Tom never liked to go fishing.
It was very painful.
The teacher was surrounded by her students.
I didn't know how much sugar to add.
I want to be the boss.
I wanted to quit.
That was a pretty good movie.
I think that it's not necessary to do that.
Tom shouldn't have left so early.
When was the last time you swam?
Tom is thirty.
Tell me how it happened.
I have never seen her help her father.
I didn't know about your plan.
Have a nice swim.
I'll give you a piece of good advice.
Why do you hate me?
We're getting better.
I love that combination.
Tom's eyes are very red.
Bring Tom next time.
That's absolutely right.
I need to think about it.
How many teams are there?
"Sorry, I was distracted."
Everyone seems to be hungry but me.
I don't know what you need.
Don't make me angry.
I'm in bed.
My mother finally came home.
Let me finish eating my sandwich.
I'm afraid I have some bad news.
You should stay where you are.
He was the first to help her.
I didn't know what else to say.
He said he would come.
The decision is in your hands.
I suppose you know where Tom is.
"If Tom hadn't eaten the mushrooms he found in the woods, he'd be alive now."
Are you sure one bottle of wine is going to be enough?
Tell me how you solved the problem.
Tom dedicated his book to Mary.
Tom said that you'd understand.
Tom coughed loudly.
Take off your cap.
Mary wants to become a teacher.
Do you really think I'm going to drink that?
I beg you to stay.
I know that you're in love with me.
I don't know when Tom will leave Japan.
You always said you wanted to become a teacher.
You can't cheat fate.
Tom was the coordinator.
Tom pretended to be unhappy.
"You don't really want this job, do you?"
I want to leave today.
He's offered to help.
You said you needed more time.
They look American.
We've got to do that on Monday.
Tom is friendly.
Let's go into the other room.
I don't think that this is Tom's hat.
I didn't bring my swimsuit.
Would you like this?
Is Tom your brother?
I've won a free trip to Boston.
Tom is going to find out who did that.
We play chess every evening.
Tom told us about you.
My books don't sell very well.
It took me more than one month to get over my cold.
You should know better.
How can you be sure?
I told Tom that wasn't a good idea.
Why isn't Tom fighting back?
Do you want to do something together?
It feels silly.
Tom told Mary what he has to buy.
She was right in the middle of cutting cucumbers.
Don't wake him up.
Tell me more about what happened.
Tom must already be in Australia.
I'm certain that won't happen today.
I have some things for Tom.
Where did you get it?
No one visited me today.
Do you have one?
It's been a while since I've ridden a horse.
We have won again.
He was naive.
Tom hasn't finished his homework yet.
I broke my leg skiing.
I think you know we need to hurry.
Tom showed me a picture of his grandmother.
They want you dead.
He described exactly what happened.
Tom has nothing to lose.
I want to know why you didn't get here on time.
Tom wasn't a teacher.
Tom needs to talk to us.
Every country has its own history.
I hope I can get my old job back.
Tom didn't like the movie.
Japan depends on other countries for oil.
I wouldn't bet on that if I were you.
It is a depressing prospect.
Tom has a good lawyer.
They have just arrived.
Is the snake alive or dead?
I can't believe Tom is dead.
I thought I heard you come in.
It's about something else.
I don't know how long the meeting will last.
Could you show me the way to the station?
Tom's car's outside.
"Tom can do it, can't he?"
I only hope it is not too late.
I have a family myself.
"In my family, the punishment for lying was severe."
Four percent inflation is forecast for this year.
Circumstances forced us to put off the meeting.
Her mother will continue to work.
Don't get upset.
"You were at home yesterday, weren't you?"
You're likely not to even notice any difference.
Tom was bored.
Tom bumped into Mary.
No one knows anything.
Tom told Mary that he thought a hippopotamus could run at a speed of about 30 kilometers per hour.
I remember it like it was yesterday.
You have nothing to fear.
We think that he will come.
I should relax.
Don't I look great?
I didn't see Tom doing that.
It's not that easy.
Tom has a lot of books.
Tom pointed his gun at Mary.
Are you going by bus or car?
What did you want?
He left the room when I came in.
Please feed the dog every day.
We need to ask you a few questions.
Do you need me?
I think I'll take that one.
"Excuse me, can you lower your voice a little bit?"
"By the way, have you heard from him lately?"
Sheep are bred for their fleece and their meat.
"Sorry, I didn't know you were still here."
I always wear a tie to work.
Did you give the order?
It's on the table.
I'm grateful for everything I have.
I'll release you.
Who's the man playing the violin?
You can watch television after dinner.
Do you know what Tom ate for lunch?
I know that you stole it.
There's something lying on the ground.
I cannot help thinking about him.
I've already read that novel.
My grandparents died before I was born.
Tom and I are very busy.
I talked to the waiter in French.
I can no longer trust you.
I know we can do that.
Scotland can be very warm in September.
I hope you're proud of yourselves.
I suppose you're busy.
Tom disappeared into the forest.
He is writing a novel.
Why are things different now?
Tom asked Mary if she had to do that.
Tom also went to Boston.
I'm sober.
Tom said you wouldn't win.
She knows your mother very well.
All the exams are now behind us.
Tom isn't trying to do anything.
We saw them last night.
His popularity is falling.
Tom is almost unable to walk.
My mother doesn't like wearing heels.
Not a soul was to be seen in the parking lot.
Tom looked after my dog while I was traveling in Australia.
He bragged about it.
I've always been here.
Someone stole my lunch.
He wants to get rid of the ants.
Not everyone is happy.
I danced all night long.
I didn't ask whether you wanted to go.
It can be difficult.
"Whatever he may say, I won't change my mind."
The whistle blew.
He came to ask us for our help.
I like this custom.
Tom didn't have the slightest idea what Mary was talking about.
"You'll feel better tomorrow morning, I'm sure."
I'm the only one who understands you.
I was sure I heard something.
"Yes, Tom actually said that."
That happened three years ago.
Did you get married?
Is that difficult?
I have to say I envy you.
Tell Tom I'll leave.
Tom handed Mary the pencil.
Tom treated Mary very well.
Tom couldn't fall asleep because he was thinking about Mary.
I know where you were born.
I'm in the army.
Something tells me you're wrong.
Tom has never worked with Mary.
Who do you think is to blame?
Where's the cat?
We need a bigger house.
What exactly are you suggesting?
I'm very allergic to peanuts.
Which one's yours?
Tom said that he'd try.
Our plans for tomorrow depend on the weather.
Where is the exit?
He's a professional photographer.
Tom headed for the door.
Tom is very impolite.
I still don't know how it happened.
I thought Tom would give up.
She gave him a nice present.
It's very late.
I'll never tell you.
Tell Tom to stay away from my house.
Mary is going to have a baby.
Many families eat dinner while watching TV.
I don't need you.
He made the right choice.
You seem to be bored.
I'll be very busy next month.
Are you famous?
Things don't always happen the way we'd like.
There's no need to be scared.
Can you come at nine?
Which road should I take?
"I know I should sleep for at least eight hours a day, however I usually sleep less."
It's the best we have.
I'm not a soldier.
I can't study with you watching me.
Why doesn't anybody help Tom?
I hate moving.
She lives on a small pension.
Was this man threatening you?
Tom ate it.
The old man was loved by everyone.
"If I were rich, I'd give you money."
The two books are equivalent in value.
That's not good.
I don't have time for this.
I hear you got married again.
I didn't expect to see you again.
I'm calling you.
I tried on the shirt.
You're both insane.
Neither of them was present at the meeting.
I am thinking about my children.
That scenario is unlikely.
Behave yourself.
I'm jealous of you.
They won't hurt you.
All you had to do was ask and I would have lent you as much money as you needed.
You're way out of line.
Have you measured it?
Let us know if you can come.
You're not that old.
Can you break an egg with one hand?
He compared his car to the new model.
Tom isn't interested in politics at all.
I want to thank you for answering all my questions.
Tom usually pays for everything in cash.
I decided I had to take the risk.
It has become quite common.
Tom denied nothing.
He loves her.
What did she say?
Tom is very strange.
"Yeah, you're right."
That is all.
I know Tom is happy.
"No matter where you go, I'll follow you."
She had to study hard to catch up with her classmates.
He was very thirsty and asked for some water.
Have you eaten supper yet?
Aren't you afraid to die?
I don't like horror movies.
Tom likes ice cream.
We elected her mayor.
Tom will probably wait until 2:30.
You're wrong about Tom.
I'm not going to tell you what to do.
Tom is always forgetting things.
I'll go with you as far as the bridge.
Tom is uninterested.
Tom likes money.
I won't listen to you anymore.
Tom's plane crashed.
It's not safe.
I will stop Tom.
He isn't good enough for her.
I hope Tom likes the gift we bought him.
Tom says he won't agree to do that.
Fetch me my hat.
Did they say what happened?
We take risks.
This is the book I want you to read.
I can't believe Tom just said that.
May I go with you?
Didn't you know where I wanted to go?
You're too picky.
We must prevent a war by all possible means.
Should I tell them the truth?
I think I'll change jobs.
I can't find my watch.
Canada is larger than Japan.
The landing was perfect.
So what'll happen now?
Unlock the door.
The girl did not say anything.
Tom won't ask for help.
Don't even talk to Tom.
I found the cage empty.
I feel bad for those people.
I think Tom has a secret admirer.
I think that we've waited long enough.
The noise kept me awake.
I got out of the taxi.
Tom turned off the sprinkler.
I don't think that Tom knows anything.
I wish I hadn't left the windows open.
Meet me here again next Monday afternoon at 2:30.
I can do nothing about that.
Would you like some advice?
Tom told Mary that he was hungry.
That's not the question.
I love Boston.
We had to call off the game because of the rain.
I don't think I know you.
Tom seldom goes to Boston.
I'm very much aware of it.
Do dolphins really sleep with one eye open?
I'll be OK.
I like their pictures.
Tom thought about what Mary said.
You can't just hide here for the rest of your life.
She complained to him about the noise.
How many more days do you plan to stay here?
We were all laughing hysterically.
He drives a truck.
There's a bird over here.
I shouldn't have left you alone.
Tom is lucky Mary hasn't done that yet.
Tom often borrows money from me.
I think Tom did well.
I'm getting sick.
I told you Tom isn't my friend.
I always wanted to be different.
Please tell me which to take.
We're unprejudiced.
I have a large family.
I was in Australia for three months last year.
Have you told anybody?
My home is separated from his by a river.
I'm afraid you can't do that.
Tom said that you're old friends.
We need you here.
Tom heard a thud.
Lemons are sour.
Could Tom do that?
We will adopt your method at our school.
She stole my clothes!
There are more girls than boys in this school.
I told Tom Mary wouldn't accept the gift.
How many volunteers did you get?
Why didn't Tom let Mary drive?
Tom sharpened his pencil.
Is there anything else you'd like?
We left at 2:30.
It's just you and me now.
My opinion doesn't matter.
This is the village where I spent my childhood.
Ask yourself that question.
I just wanted to do the right thing.
Can you recommend a good lawyer?
I don't need advisers.
I told you not to come here.
It's nice to have friends.
I have nothing to apologize for.
Tom reacted.
I'm glad Tom invited you.
I was just going home.
It gets quite hot here in the summer.
Your name was on the list.
Tom rarely walks anywhere.
His car has no wheels.
You were always a good friend to me.
I'll keep my fingers crossed.
I don't know how to use a VCR.
Tom likes folk music.
I don't disagree with Tom.
That's why I worry about you.
That man should be sentenced to death.
We grew up together.
Tom walked in.
It makes my mouth water.
Why are you asking so many questions?
How much does your daughter weigh?
Are you ready for it?
I think I'm a good coach.
I'm not going to drink this.
"When I saw Tom yesterday, he was wearing a cowboy hat."
What's their purpose?
Aren't you helping Tom?
I'm aware of the difficulties.
His family loved me.
What's it composed of?
Tom didn't even know who I was.
Tom had never seen anything like that before.
I think that something's bothering Tom.
Tell them we're coming.
Tom said you shouldn't think about it.
Tom said he couldn't find anything to eat.
They appealed to us for help.
It's past the square.
People started yelling.
Tom pressed his cheek against my cheek.
I don't think this is the best solution.
I listened.
Did you want this?
Open the box.
I went with Tom yesterday.
Tom gets pretty good grades.
I started to run.
You're old enough now.
The divers didn't make it back.
The driver of the bus was injured.
I'm afraid we have a problem.
Do you think it'll last long?
Tom is my destiny.
Do you know what this box is made of?
Tom said he didn't believe that Mary and I actually did that by ourselves.
Tom invited Mary to Boston.
Tom advised Mary to buy that car.
What is your favorite holiday?
It will not be long before man can travel to the moon.
People lost faith in banks.
I had no idea what I should write.
Can everyone see?
Some people have difficulty apologizing.
It's not illegal.
I don't think that it's my decision alone.
Take that one.
Tom opened his eyes.
The boy I helped is Tom.
Let go of my arms.
You don't need to leave now.
Tom ate more than Mary did.
That's my wife.
What can all that mean?
Can you fill out this form?
Can we fix it?
How did that happen?
I wish something nice would happen.
They said that.
I think I've seen this movie before.
I thought you wanted to get married.
Tom is never late for school.
Please call before you come.
Tom is thirty something.
Do you really believe there's a connection?
You'd better start now.
I've told you not to call me Tom.
"Long time, no see."
I'm going to be busy.
There are many videos on YouTube of people doing stupid things.
Tom isn't as fast as me.
Would you like to know who did that?
We should be there in about thirty minutes.
You look like Tom.
I shouldn't have sold my car.
It's going to get cold tonight.
I agree with everything you said.
"Slow down, Tom! Where's the fire?"
I want you out of here now.
Bee stings can be very painful.
Who was the winner?
I thought that you looked sad.
This is not for me.
Do you happen to know where Tom went?
Have you both lost your minds?
Are you interested?
What's your favorite Chinese food?
I tried to help you.
The thieves hid in the woods.
He went abroad.
That's the book I told you about.
Tom doesn't want to go by train.
Your English is improving.
Tom won't likely be interested.
The service is excellent in this hotel.
I want you to tell me everything you know about that.
Keep these documents in a safe place.
My cat purrs when I scratch behind his ears.
I had a very strange dream.
Open the door.
I'd stop doing that if you asked me to.
I happened to be in Boston at that time.
Both of us knew that would happen.
I don't think it's necessary.
Tom hardly ate anything at all.
Tom said he was sleepy.
Don't kick the door open.
I hope we'll be able to do that.
Please phone me tomorrow morning.
Have you forgotten everything we've done for you?
I'll vote for you.
Tom accepted my gift.
He would often sit for hours without saying a word.
I wouldn't want to run into him in a dark alley.
I won't leave you.
The bus should be here soon.
The flowers in the garden need to be watered.
Tom couldn't afford to buy the bicycle he wanted.
Are they going to arrest you?
You'll be hearing from us soon.
An uncle of mine is a doctor.
He hid in an abandoned building.
We can talk.
Have you made out the check yet?
I do not have much money on hand.
I don't need you anymore.
Tom is a pacifist.
I recognize that guy.
Tom lived to be 97 years old.
Let's have breakfast.
That's what I want.
I used to be very fat.
Tom is Mary's boyfriend.
He started to speak English.
Will you join me for breakfast?
Tom did most of the work by himself.
She lives in London.
Please wish me luck.
Please don't make me do it.
I can't see anything. The windshield is very dirty.
Tom asked Mary to find out where John was.
We keep two goats.
Tom doesn't know why I'm scared.
It's starting now.
I like you just the way you are.
I have one final question for you.
"Close the door, please."
"This morning, I left for school without washing my face."
I want you to know that Tom's doing OK.
Tell Tom that I'll call him back.
Tom died from food poisoning.
Would you mind if we waited here?
Do you want to live like slaves?
Tom threw a pillow at Mary.
When are you going to come?
Tom pretended not to notice.
I will soon catch up with you.
My uncle gave me a present.
I won't sell my car to you.
Tom said that he'd do that as well.
Tom refused to cooperate.
I thought that Tom would want this one.
"I don't need to sound like a native speaker, I just want to be able to speak fluently."
Were you at home yesterday?
He has a very expensive watch.
Don't make the same mistakes I did.
You've been spotted.
Tom has a surprise for you.
I know why Tom doesn't like Mary.
I'm telling you Tom will understand.
There were lots of people.
You have to say yes.
The driver turned the wheel to the right.
He has a cat and two dogs.
I can't drive yet.
Perhaps you are mistaken.
Get them out of here.
I'm no longer angry at you.
I don't have much time.
Tom is John's oldest son.
He hurt his left hand with a knife.
Tom struggled to stay focused.
I'm tidy.
Someone tried to kill us.
What have you found?
Tom said he was interested.
Did you call Tom this morning?
You're a good friend.
I am not about to pay ten dollars.
Please give me a break.
He was tired so he went to bed.
Should I tell him?
Tom is arguing with his wife.
Don't hesitate to call if you need me.
The prawn cocktail was delicious.
I knew I would find you here.
We'll be back in Boston by 2:30.
Am I making myself perfectly clear?
She fell in love with a prince.
Did you hear what Tom said about Mary?
Where did Tom buy those shoes?
Tom is caught between a rock and a hard place.
I asked a lot of questions.
Did your parents approve of your marriage?
It's too complicated.
Tom was a little disappointed.
Have you come to save me?
I've done something wrong.
Hold it!
Tom bribed the guards.
Tom snuck up behind Mary.
I like summer better than winter.
He's always saying bad things about his wife.
That is what I want to know.
He never laughs at my jokes.
Where did you take your jeans off?
I'm sure that our team will win.
Tom hasn't translated the article yet.
I accompanied him on the trip.
I had breakfast at 7:30.
I'm sorry I hurt you.
Tom lost the money that Mary gave him.
Why did you poison me?
You know I don't like it when you're late.
The police searched Tom's car.
Can you buy shampoo?
Tom explained why he was late.
I don't think I broke any rules.
It was poison gas.
I'd like to go with you.
Do you smell rubber burning?
I thought you'd be interested.
Where's your luggage?
He was not a good politician.
Either Tom doesn't want to do it or he can't.
What did we do wrong?
Please let us know.
They're allies.
Tom is going to regret this.
Tom couldn't walk without a cane.
The only question is where.
Don't underestimate the problem.
Tom turned off his alarm and went back to sleep.
"That's mine, too."
Tom is still poor.
Just tell me what to do.
Don't ask me for money.
I don't know much about this subject.
I had an interesting day today.
The protesters threw stones at the police.
Tom was found dead in his prison cell.
Tom is wearing a party hat.
I forbid you to leave the house.
"Tom didn't eat breakfast, did he?"
Even Tom didn't know how to do that.
Tom said I should've asked Mary to do that for me.
"If you don't go, I won't go either."
You're too young to get married.
I heard somebody laughing.
Tom arrived home soaking wet.
Please remain seated.
His older brother passed away last month.
Tell Tom to let the dog in.
What else does Tom need?
Tom says he's not done yet.
There's nothing to tell.
Mary can dance well.
I'm sure I can find it.
I don't think that I'll lose.
The wind grew stronger.
You're working too hard. Take it easy for a while.
Our company needs people like you.
She needs you.
I was a doctor.
Are you sure Tom wants to win?
"Since you're tired, you should rest."
Tom told me that he didn't like Mary.
We're going to crash.
What should we do about Tom?
"When he was young, he was a hard worker."
I won't tell anyone if you won't.
Give me a ride.
"Where are Tom and Mary? ""They're on their way."""
I thought that you were staying at Tom's.
He sent some of his men into the valley.
Please ask Tom to leave.
Have dinner with me.
The music is too loud. Please turn it down.
I don't have time to cook.
Tom wanted to help Mary find a job.
Tom is the one who's winning.
Where did all the money go?
The government is trying to bring down inflation.
I went swimming with Tom.
Everybody likes you.
Doesn't it taste good?
Did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed?
What's your favorite game?
How much chocolate did you buy?
I still don't remember calling you.
Tell me what's bothering you.
I don't know if I should turn left or right.
I know that Tom is obstinate.
You knew I wouldn't do that.
You have a sense of humor.
Why are you wearing that?
He hurried in order to get the bus.
Some economists wouldn't agree with that statement.
Tom did nothing to help Mary.
Tom has nowhere to run to.
I suppose you know why Tom didn't do what we asked him to do.
We're not going to let Tom do that.
Tom still has a flip phone.
Please stop!
Tom doesn't know I'm Mary's brother.
Tom is asleep on the sofa.
I don't understand what you are trying to say.
We do this every year.
I thought that I'd forgotten to close the windows.
We're not here to arrest you.
Tom was quite happy.
I will play the guitar for you.
I didn't move an inch.
"Tom will help us tomorrow. ""I wouldn't count on it."""
