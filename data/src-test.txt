Someone visited her yesterday.
You deal with it.
Can you understand me?
We need to do that immediately.
Mary is the most beautiful woman I know.
I thought it would make him laugh.
It is cloudy now.
This room looks like a pigsty.
When did it start?
Nuclear weapons may bring about the annihilation of man.
I was hoping you would know Tom's address.
How much butter did you buy?
I wish I could be in Boston now.
I'm completely exhausted.
Please call a taxi.
I want you to teach Tom how to do that.
Money is useless when you're dead.
Tom was shot three times in the back.
Is this your beer?
Is her father alive?
He reached for the book.
Tom hasn't had lunch yet.
"Maybe he likes you, too."
Tom was sick.
The majority is not always right.
Let me help you find it.
Tom doesn't know anything about Mary at all.
The fact is that I don't know anything about him.
Where else should we go?
I'm anxious to get started.
I wake up very early.
This is my desk.
The road was muddy and slippery.
They must be dead.
Tom opened his backpack.
"I bought the book for myself, not for my wife."
You're not looking.
Where's your friend?
Pick a date.
Most of the participants are from Australia.
"You don't think I did that, do you?"
Tom has finally gone.
I don't think that anybody noticed what we were doing.
I don't know how long I was unconscious.
This is a very good start.
Are you okay?
We have to keep it a secret.
Why can't you do what you're told?
"Tom never said that, as far as I know."
Tom doesn't like it here.
Tom was prepared.
Neither Tom nor Mary bought anything.
Show me how you did it.
I realize Tom wasn't joking.
You must not discuss this with anyone.
We're talking about you.
What's the time according to your watch?
Did you kidnap Tom?
Have you been mistreated?
Please lock the door when you leave.
Tom is going to Boston again next weekend.
You're too young to get married.
Everything has returned to normal.
Could you water my garden for me while I'm away?
I think that would explain everything.
This medicine should be taken every three hours.
Tom never returned.
I hope that you and Tom will have a good time.
Tom left at four in the morning.
I figured I could trust you.
Why's the door locked?
Tom wasn't a good actor.
Don't give it to anyone.
Tom set the timer.
This is a deplorable state of affairs.
I've already spoken to Tom about it.
The building is on fire.
Tom hasn't packed his suitcase yet.
You've got to win.
Did Tom confess to killing Mary?
I won't tolerate this.
You're taller than your father.
Tom lives somewhere near the park.
I didn't know that it was there.
Tom and Mary both agree.
It is one of the biggest summer music festivals.
This is the tricky part.
Justice will prevail in the end.
You should have seen me.
Did you know that carp eat tadpoles?
He has his reasons for staying there.
My father doesn't have a car.
He doesn't seem to be heading for the town.
How was the party?
Tom wasn't the one who won.
We've got to leave early.
She can't stop it.
You should've learned that in school.
Tom isn't in danger.
I'm feeling sick.
When was the first time Tom kissed you?
When were you planning to tell me?
My French teacher is the same age as me.
You may be asked to give a speech.
Are you going to school tomorrow?
Why don't you ask Tom how he did that?
I wanted to hear you say that.
Did your husband have many enemies?
I need to know what I should tell Tom.
The robot went out of control.
I need your number.
I didn't buy bread.
"We need to ask you a few questions, Tom."
What're you drinking?
Did Tom seem happy?
It was cold outside.
I didn't know you could cook like this.
Tom certainly plays the guitar well.
I'll pay later.
I must talk with Tom.
Cheers!
Wait until I look this manuscript over.
I probably would've done the same thing.
Swimming is not allowed in this river.
Tom decided to walk home.
Are you spending enough time with your kids?
My friend was very angry when he saw the driver of the car in front of him throw a cigarette butt out the window.
Could you tell me how to get to the subway station?
We can't pretend that it didn't happen.
I don't think I'll ever go back to Boston again.
We are very sorry that your order was damaged.
The days grow shorter as winter approaches.
Tom's car isn't where he parked it.
Would you recognize Tom if you saw him?
I want to find out what happened to Tom.
My father traveled all over the world by air.
I'm just listening.
Have you seen my glasses?
Something has changed.
I don't think that Tom is going to want to do that.
I know a lot of people don't agree with me.
I don't have any proof.
I think it'd be better if you didn't do that.
Her eyes were red from crying.
I hope he will come up with a new and good idea.
No such person exists.
An electric current can generate magnetism.
We're all prisoners.
Tom has persuaded Mary to do that.
You'd better start as soon as possible.
Tom comes to Boston a lot.
Can you really do it?
Do you want me to repeat the question?
I got Tom to do it.
There are many dangers ahead.
The girl wearing a white dress is my sister.
Tom knows I'm ticklish.
Tom will be arrested if he does that.
What kind of meal did you eat?
"Tom wasn't at home, was he?"
Tom didn't buy it.
Tom unlocked the safe.
I can't use this.
"Tom wanted to help, but he didn't have time."
We're paying.
It's been five years since we moved here.
I knew what Tom needed to do.
The situation quickly got out of hand.
We agree on that.
I don't think I like you.
Why don't you make up your mind?
"Today, I went to the doctor's."
Do you want to go out tonight?
Call the police.
Attendance is free.
"He has a sister and she goes to school, too."
"Tom doesn't care, but I do."
I always do the dishes.
What do you do on Sundays?
The cat which you found is mine.
I don't want Tom to hear about this.
Call the doctor.
Tom also plays tennis.
Tom is the boy I told you about.
Tom immediately fell asleep.
You said that you hated Tom.
I have no reason not to do that.
The initial symptoms of the disease are fever and sore throat.
We're having lunch here.
I don't want to go to the lake.
These are my students.
Everyone's fine.
What're you laughing at?
Children are expensive.
I don't want to make Tom sad.
The wine and beer are good.
I called the police and reported that my car had been stolen.
Tom asked Mary where she'd parked her car.
Does Tom have something to hide?
Tell me how your date went.
Mary was wearing a black robe.
I was listening.
"I don't know when, but it'll happen someday."
I just had to check on something.
Tom knows Mary quite well.
They're my classmates.
I thought you said that it was yours.
Did you break the window on purpose or by accident?
I don't remember anything else.
She lost her son in a car accident.
Tom wasn't in our group.
You should listen to Tom.
Aren't you the one who taught Tom how to do that?
Tom couldn't find his way back.
She likes the smell of pine trees.
I said some things I didn't mean.
Tom is writing a book about that now.
She stood up and walked to the window.
Did you really think that was what Tom wanted?
The show is over.
I didn't know what I needed to do.
Does anybody here know where Tom lives?
What else can you tell me?
Which flower do you like the most?
Tom is in a bad mood.
I know Tom has a house in Boston.
They already have one.
I thought you were Tom.
He lives within a stone's throw of the school.
It seemed the whole town was here.
Are you hungry?
Tom works alone.
You have to eat before you go.
How was work today?
I've started to read the book.
Tom bowed respectfully to the old lady.
I guess that some things never change.
I often stay in bed until noon on Sundays.
I don't have time for all of this.
Am I wrong?
"Just between you and me, he is a liar."
Please take us with you.
"If the boss finds this out, I'm done for."
"In late November, they attacked Finland."
Tell Tom I'd like to help.
Tom avoided looking at Mary.
I can't eat meat.
Why are we leaving?
He had to find another way.
I've already seen it.
We shouldn't be fighting with each other.
Did you notice Mary's earrings?
He's wide awake.
"At first, I didn't believe you."
I'm not afraid to go into the cave.
Meeting Tom was quite an experience for me.
I didn't know you spoke French.
I saw what your dog did.
Don't be stingy.
Tom wants to tell you something important.
We're in serious trouble.
You don't have to worry.
I have the ace of spades.
That's a bright idea.
There was a steady increase in population.
I didn't tell Tom any of that.
Who wears the pants in your family?
How did that get here?
Tom asked Mary to wake him up at 2:30.
We want to do some partying.
My father seldom smokes.
Did you buy a new car?
I was in Australia last spring.
I have a pressing engagement elsewhere.
They are going.
I feel well now.
Tom tried to kill Mary.
"I was born on April 3, 1950."
I have a kid.
I probably speak French better than Tom.
What's your response?
I liked your idea and adopted it.
I didn't expect to win.
I can get us everything we need.
I don't take bribes.
I'd like to read it.
She had a basket full of apples.
Don't give Tom my number.
Thank you so very much.
Tom is just pretending he's tired.
It could be dangerous to do what Tom is asking us to do.
My eyesight is beginning to fail.
I'd like to believe that that's true.
I'm not illiterate.
I met him about noon.
Don't cut that wire.
I don't think that Tom even saw me.
I told Tom to eat more vegetables.
Tom wanted to spend the weekend in Boston.
Don't be disgusting.
What did you do next?
You'd better take care of that soon.
Let's go tell Tom.
"You have to believe me, Tom."
It's certainly worth a try.
Tom wasn't wearing a gray suit.
Tom wanted Mary and I to do that by ourselves.
Most of these products are domestic.
Is Tom aware of his mistake?
Tom saw her.
I didn't go by train.
What page are you on?
We do not know him.
Tom hasn't given us anything.
I must go back to Boston.
You don't know whether he has a girlfriend?
Tom didn't want to do it alone.
We've been here since October.
That's really annoying.
It's very close.
I'd like to believe you're right.
Are you worried about something?
"I owe her 100,000 yen."
Your question is not relevant to the subject.
We had a good time playing chess.
Your time is up.
Will I have time to eat?
I knew you wouldn't have enough money.
I like short poems.
I can't think of anybody else.
I thought that Tom just needed some more time.
Welcome to the United States.
Tom isn't as impatient as Mary.
We played chess all night.
I played tennis all day.
It's been so long since I've been here.
There were many children in the square.
I don't understand why Tom brought you here.
Tom said Mary almost died in the accident.
How can people be so cruel?
I'll call for an ambulance.
What is this thing for?
Can you tell me why Tom is in Boston?
Could you gift wrap it?
Show them what you can do.
What year are you in school?
I'm the one who taught Tom how to ride a bicycle.
This car sells well.
I don't think I like this game very much.
No one could solve the puzzle.
This stone has a hole in the center.
Tom told me to be more careful.
I can't believe Tom did this.
"Sorry, I didn't mean to snap at you."
Tom hung the picture on the wall.
Tom had breakfast.
I'm pleasantly surprised by that.
I know Tom loves doing that.
Refugees hid under the bridge.
Tom's heart nearly stopped.
Tom likes to talk a lot.
I think we need to postpone the meeting.
You're entitled to your opinion.
I don't feel like waiting any longer.
The commission has promised to take action soon.
Let's start at 2:30.
Keep your money in a safe place.
Tom doesn't tell me anything.
I only drink decaffeinated coffee.
I'd rather live in a wooden house.
Don't push me!
Please come on Monday.
What would you like to order?
Why is Tom learning French?
You have chosen the best.
"Where's your cousin? ""He just left."""
Tom found Mary an apartment not too far from where she works.
I was waving a flag.
I would never lie to you.
Please leave now.
I can barely hear you.
Tom told me something was wrong.
I didn't know whether I should do that or not.
That tower you see over there is the Eiffel Tower.
It never dawned on me that I would be a suspect.
I like wearing long skirts.
Have you ever lived in a rural area?
Our ship wasn't damaged in the battle.
You should read this.
I hope you found everything.
Where's Tom gone?
Tom told me to give this to you.
Do you like oysters?
Tell Tom what happened.
I don't think I have enough time.
I exercise because I want to stay healthy.
Tom is obviously scared.
Could I borrow a hammer?
How long have you been playing the violin?
His son is ill.
Who did you give it to?
I can't resist a woman who knows what she wants.
I burned it.
I haven't started yet.
I know Tom has a pool.
Why do you like squirrels so much?
We'll have a French test next Monday.
It won't be the same without you.
They believe me.
Tom chained himself to a tree.
Tom wasn't interested in anything else.
Tom is barely alive.
I need it now.
You're sick!
Just throw it away.
Show me the picture.
Tom still works here.
Tom ran to school.
You'd better go home.
I'll help you find it.
"When we saw what was happening there, we decided to leave."
I'm pretty sure Tom is in love with Mary.
What happened to your computer?
Tom is very kind to everyone.
I think that it might snow tonight.
Why did Tom leave?
You're too young to do that.
I was concerned.
Why didn't you call for help?
The earth is smaller than the sun.
Tom said that Mary was OK.
Nobody knows why this kind of thing happens.
It's only three miles to the village.
I coughed.
I also want to be happy.
Tom said that Mary was asleep.
Exercise is vital for a dog.
My friend wants to talk to you.
I don't understand what you're asking me to do.
Tom is a very good boy.
She advised him to drink more milk.
I know where you went.
Why are men like that?
I don't know what Tom looks like.
What motivates you?
I'm starting to believe that.
"Without your help, he would fail."
I didn't want to embarrass you in front of your friends.
Who helped you?
Has Tom left?
My neck hurts today.
The train is going at a speed of 50 miles per hour.
I have plenty of time to do that.
Get in the car.
We get a lot of requests.
I didn't tell Tom I was married.
Tom wasn't paying attention to what Mary was saying.
Please tell Tom to hurry.
I'm giving you what you want.
I want you to put out that cigarette.
You are really talented.
We don't deserve all of this.
I lost my job on Monday.
We need you to help us this afternoon.
Tom and Mary are blood relatives.
Tom saw Mary doing that.
The garbage collector comes three times a week.
"Are you going, too?"
I didn't know what was in the box.
Carry this over there.
I want to get out of this town.
I hope you get well soon.
I think it's going to be fun.
Tell us all about it.
I thought you liked parties.
I think Tom is strong.
Tom became blind.
Why did you listen to them?
I've gotten used to the noise.
Do you have any problems with that?
You know what I need.
We can't begin the meeting until we have a quorum.
"If Tom comes, please give him this book."
Tom said you'd phone me.
That'll never happen to you.
Tom likes him.
Is Tom a prisoner?
How did Tom get here?
Everyone likes big pizzas.
I tried to do what you asked me to do.
I want you to meet him in order to hear his opinion.
I'm really cold.
Do you like this music?
I bought two more just like that one.
Tom may not want to stay.
Do you still remember your first plane trip?
You're splitting hairs.
I hope that you wait for us.
Try another one.
Why are you so interested?
"It's possible, isn't it?"
Are vampires real?
What are we eating for dinner?
Are you really only thirteen?
The Japanese take off their shoes when they enter a house.
You don't have to thank us.
"I'm not poor, but not rich either."
I have a husband.
Why did Tom come?
Tom has to speak French every day at work.
We're not getting married.
I was the one who taught Tom how to read.
I have enough to worry about already.
Tom was born on the twentieth of October.
How long has it been since you talked to Tom?
I have no idea why Tom quit his job.
Tom found it.
We can't use this.
Don't go.
What kind of plants are these?
Would you change your past if you could?
Tom ducked into the alley.
Tom was very suspicious.
There's absolutely nothing wrong with what you did.
Nobody knows what's going to happen.
Tom might not know that we're here.
Let's go for a sail.
This is going to be easy.
You surprised me.
I'll get up.
Which one do you choose?
I didn't know you could sing so well.
Didn't you know Tom could play the guitar?
A boat capsized.
The young man that you saw is my brother.
I hope Tom likes me.
I'll shut the door.
Tom says he can do that by himself.
I wanted you to win.
My hobby is reading.
Dragons are imaginary animals.
I want you to open the window.
Tom said that Mary was free.
I know someone was here.
I'm my own boss.
Do you know how I can get in touch with Tom?
He sat at a distance from me.
You're going to get better.
Tom said almost the same thing.
I just don't understand.
I went to the post office.
Tom shouldn't have asked Mary to help him.
He works too much.
Take off your coat and make yourself at home.
I found out who did that.
I don't think that I'd like doing that.
What does that actually mean?
They want to meet you.
I am ready for death.
Tom and Mary deserve better.
Tell me why you didn't do it.
When did Tom die?
I've told you that many times already.
Behind every great man is a great woman.
Hurry or you'll miss the train.
I promise you that it won't last long.
He is good for nothing.
I don't think that's very funny.
Is that why they died?
English is not difficult to learn.
Street racing is dangerous and stupid.
The pieces of broken glass glittered in the sun.
Tom guessed what was going on.
Tom still doesn't know what Mary did.
I did that for free.
Tom ate too much.
What does this sentence mean?
I'm perfectly happy.
I know Tom wants you to do that.
All drivers should obey the rules of the road.
Tom and Mary moved to Boston last October.
I saw you yesterday at the funeral.
I have wonderful memories of Boston.
I hope Tom is in a good mood.
I really thought Tom was happy.
Where would I find books?
Tom dresses well.
I'll meet you at the station.
Do you believe in love at the first sight?
Which is better?
Please put that book back exactly where it was.
I love Mexican food.
Tell me where we're going.
Who is already awake?
I saw Tom at the bar last night.
We've got to call the police.
Tom has a black belt in karate.
I reviewed the file.
We won't have time to do that.
We often do that together.
Tom has always hated me.
Tom didn't need it anymore.
What you said made everybody angry.
Tom was only thirteen when he came to Boston.
Tom could tell by the look on Mary's face that she was very excited.
Tom missed Mary.
Tell Tom he has to leave.
I've already seen it.
I always suspected him of using drugs.
I think you have too many pairs of shoes.
I didn't know you were staying at this hotel.
What projects are you working on now?
I didn't give up.
"I want to help you, but I can't."
I thought he would be upset.
Tom has found something.
I have many friends here.
I knew I shouldn't have talked to Tom.
I'm conservative.
Thanks for saving my life.
You look like you're sick.
I'm much more experienced than you are.
I know I'm going to regret this.
Do you want to know when Tom did that?
Why are you jumping?
What year is it?
I wanted to show it to you.
He cannot have been there yesterday.
You can't buy anything if you have no money.
Can you verify that?
I told Tom to wait for me.
He looked over my report.
Tom thinks he knows what to do.
It belongs to my father.
I didn't know you then.
Did you have a good weekend?
You take this one.
You can't live on that island.
She suggested that he try it.
I'm glad to see that you're happy.
I know you feel helpless.
We saw an island in the distance.
Make sure you get enough sleep.
I need a nap.
We are having a meeting.
Why does everyone hate Tom?
His proposal is not worth talking about.
Those men are seasoned soldiers.
Tom saw Mary working.
Was there something you wanted to ask me?
We were here yesterday.
We had a good opinion of your son.
Don't you want to know where I was?
Almost all of the dogs are alive.
When do we go?
Tom is alone in his bedroom.
Tom is very friendly.
I was a stranger.
Tom claims that he didn't cry.
I didn't understand your question.
Tom left Australia.
How about going to the movies?
She saved money for a rainy day.
The sad story moved us to tears.
They buy vegetables at the supermarket.
Were you working last night?
Tom denied the accusations.
This soup needs a bit more salt.
Nobody I know likes Tom.
Are there still wild bears in Germany?
Don't delete this file.
I was still living with my parents then.
I called to thank Tom.
Tom did it the old way.
I love Chinese food.
I just don't want you to misunderstand me.
Everybody except Tom seems to be having fun.
We can't let Tom do that.
I might need that.
I cried a lot.
Mary injured her back playing tennis.
I usually agree with Tom.
I didn't get enough sleep.
I tanned myself on the beach.
Tom doesn't understand how this works.
He told us to depart at once.
Tom helped Mary do that.
They made up an unlikely story.
I don't recall you saying anything about that.
I'll come to your house later.
Tom was given a medal.
I'm asking you both to try again.
Don't say anything to anyone.
"Disconnect the power cable from the modem, wait for approximately one minute, then reconnect the cable."
Tom got out his pen.
Didn't you wear that same shirt yesterday?
Someone sent me a gift.
I have always kept my promises.
I gave some of my old clothes to the Salvation Army.
Tom and Mary have a horse.
That book is worth reading.
I'll understand if you're not interested.
Do you think Tom did that for Mary?
I was disgusted.
Tom has braided his beard.
There was a big fire near my house last night.
I liked the movie a lot.
Write your telephone number down on this pad.
A boy needs a father he can look up to.
I can't hear anything because of the noise.
Tom has stopped doing that already.
What about Tom?
Where can I buy a map of the city?
I don't know how to do that.
Which airport do I leave from?
"I am seventeen years old, too."
I spoke with Tom today.
I feel so sorry for Tom.
Which one did you buy?
He has built two houses so far.
I face a dilemma.
I'd talk Tom tomorrow if I were you.
Tom was born on a plane.
What crime did Tom commit?
You intimidate Tom.
Tom thinks it's stupid.
Tom didn't know when to shut up.
Let's see what Tom has to offer.
Don't lie to me.
What's your favorite way to relax?
Can I take photographs here?
He likes soccer.
Why isn't the ship moving?
I'll be sure to remember that.
He slipped out the back door.
No one questioned anything.
Isn't that sad?
Where are you going tomorrow?
Tom never was lazy.
Tom is anxious about his future.
How much chocolate should I buy?
Tom filled the bathtub with warm water.
Tom wore black jeans and a white T-shirt.
"Even if it rains tomorrow, I'll go there."
I was talking about something else.
There was nothing I could do to help.
"You don't want to talk to me, do you?"
Don't deny it.
Did you dance by yourself?
The store is almost empty.
They love me.
Why is this door always locked?
I'm surprised that Tom didn't agree with you.
Tom likes them.
No one knew Tom was going to do that.
I don't want you to die.
I prefer rice to bread.
I want to come.
Tom's parents died when Tom was three.
I think Tom likes doing that.
We're coming.
Tom still has to pack his suitcase.
Tom said I ought to laugh more often.
What have you bought your girlfriend for Christmas?
Can you imagine what life would be like without television?
We have enough data.
Give me my sword.
I'm starting to think I'm never going to meet Tom.
I won't pay for you.
The earth is similar to an orange in shape.
Tom has been living in Australia for a long time.
The decision is mine.
Tom has an older sister named Mary.
I bought this book in Boston last month.
Can you give me a better explanation?
You're a good painter.
I only did the bare minimum.
Are you hiding something from me?
Do you think I'm joking?
I thought you were from Boston.
I'm not afraid to fight.
Put that back.
There's an easy solution.
You should've heard the family's reaction when I told them the good news.
I hope the police catch the guy who did this.
My mother died on the same day I got married.
Tom is drunk again.
How was yesterday?
You'd better see for yourself.
Was anyone in the room?
Tom went to jail.
Did I miss the turn?
It's a nice town.
I don't think that Tom was hiding.
What are those flowers called?
There is a cookie under the table.
Find yourself a seat.
I admire your optimism.
I could've simply refused to do that.
What prevented you from coming here yesterday?
Are you playing games with me?
Does Tom not understand what's happening?
Please cut your toenails.
Who plays the keyboards in your band?
We study French at school.
I think I sat on it.
Tom hasn't yet done what he promised he would do.
We're sure we can do that.
I can help you with that.
What is the price of that book?
There's nowhere for us to hide.
Tom is deceitful.
Is this the problem?
You may have to wait.
I'll call you back at about 2:30.
I've been to Australia.
Tom and Mary both cried.
I'm not going to give up.
There's too much noise outside.
The driver told us which bus we should take.
Tom needs to change his attitude.
Won't you stay for supper?
Why are you telling me that Tom has a girlfriend?
I've been watching you study.
Why are there so many mistakes in this document?
Tom gives me lots of advice.
I wasn't watching.
This is too long.
Why don't you stay with me for a few days?
We must've taken the wrong road.
I want this luggage carried to my room at once.
Call me when you're ready.
I'd rather wait here.
I hid myself behind a curtain.
You fainted.
Tom left work at 2:30.
Leave tomorrow.
This is probably for you.
Can I have a word with you alone?
I did my job.
I'm the last one who talked to Tom.
You didn't finish your drink.
Tom said he would do that again.
I constantly quarrel with my wife.
"On that day, Japanese flags were flying."
I've decided to ask Mary if she'll marry me.
Tom was alone.
What's your favorite flavor?
Are you shy?
Tom pretended not to know what to do.
Tom says that he likes the idea.
Their behavior changed drastically.
This is the same pencil that I lost the other day.
"She is American, but she lives in England."
This is cheap.
She bought a Chinese fan.
I'm not drunk.
Tom is a politician.
Do you really think Tom is handsome?
The population of Japan is about 120 million.
I didn't eat anything else.
"If you don't eat, you'll die."
Tell Tom to stop staring at me.
We have to protect our kids.
Tom comes home every day for lunch.
I won't leave you alone.
Tom is homesick.
There's something for you on the table.
Will they believe Tom?
I want Tom to help us.
I take back everything I've said.
I know that somebody had to do that.
"Tom, we've arrived!"
My mother bakes bread every morning.
We're doing it for free.
I told you this is how it would end.
I brought you your medicine.
Tom solved that problem.
All of us are going to Boston.
Do that before it gets dark.
I want him to be informed about that in advance.
Tom has lost almost thirty pounds.
The snow stopped falling.
I told you it wasn't Tom.
I didn't know that Tom enjoyed doing that.
That will be all for today.
Tom gave Mary a little encouragement.
Tom is leaving in three days.
Do they know that we know?
Is that a rhetorical question?
This is also ideal as a gift.
I think Tom won the election.
Why did you open the box?
They were left speechless.
"Luckily, Tom had a good lawyer."
Tom and Mary look healthy.
"Mary is pretty, isn't she?"
He decided to come.
I think it's doable.
I was a little worried.
I didn't know you were so rich.
You've worked hard.
Tom pretended not to look.
They didn't make a deal.
Do you want to see them?
Where's the director?
I know that I can count on you.
My glasses keep slipping down my nose.
He attended the high school for three years without missing a single day or being late.
I believed everything they told us.
This is what we're up against.
Tom kicked the bucket.
He learned to swim.
"Check, please."
Tom will continue.
This isn't good.
"Tom did it on purpose, I think."
Tom likes his teachers.
You know that you need it.
How much money can you borrow from Tom?
I'm tired and I want to go home.
Do you need it now?
Tom knows everything about cars.
"It's a good restaurant, but it's quite expensive."
Few passengers survived the catastrophe.
Is that supposed to be a question?
Give me that phone.
I wish I hadn't promised Tom that I'd help him do that.
It's hard to love somebody when you don't know whether they love you as much as you love them.
Tom has broken both his arms.
Camping is impossible where there is no water.
Tom went to see a movie.
Tom is hated by everyone.
The work here is fairly simple.
I want you to work with Tom.
I really must be going.
Tell us all about it.
Stop poking me.
We're demanding justice.
Both of us were busy.
It's time for Tom to wake up.
We've spent a lot of time in Boston.
They believed he was honest.
I regret saying that.
Tom sleeps with his socks on.
Tom read a poem to Mary.
She was on the verge of killing herself.
Tom wouldn't even discuss it.
The earth makes one revolution around the sun in about 365 days.
Tom rushed to open the door.
May I leave my suitcases here?
Tom noticed that Mary was looking at John.
Tom likes to talk on the phone.
My father listens to classical music.
I just didn't have the time.
I want to know now.
I met your girlfriend.
I refused to talk.
I'm glad I didn't do that.
His pencil has been sharpened.
I didn't know you'd do that.
They say that she was born in Germany.
The telephone hasn't been installed yet.
Why didn't you eat your carrots?
Tom and Mary discovered something amazing.
Tom acted like a baby.
I don't think this is a good approach to biology.
The doors are open.
It isn't something I'm proud of.
I believe that that won't happen.
Touch it.
The boys have gone north.
There is nothing wrong with you.
Tom and Mary usually speak French together.
I've lost everything.
Tom could do that for you.
"Where would you like to work? ""In Australia."""
We know we haven't done anything.
They're going to find us.
I didn't know if you knew.
I'd like to help you if I can.
"According to the weather forecast, the rainy season will set in next week."
Tom hasn't broken any rules.
Tom complains about everything.
I found the test difficult.
Tom knows Mary didn't do that.
"Tom is sleeping, isn't he?"
Two students are absent today.
The fence was caught with the stolen goods.
"When she was three years old, her father died."
A taxi to the airport costs around $30.
I thought that you said that it was yours.
"You hate your job, don't you?"
You'd better go.
Was that Tom you were just talking to?
I don't think that it's such a bad idea.
What's your favorite winter sport?
What else did you eat?
Tom doesn't know how much Mary loves him.
Bring it back when you're done.
I thought you'd come today.
Does Tom always talk this much?
Our fate was sealed.
Do you think we're blind?
Those people didn't tell us anything about you.
The apartment I live in isn't very large.
She wore a green dress.
Tom pushed the raft into the water.
I like old cars.
Tom and Mary have already left for Boston.
I'm not sure we can trust Tom.
There's a parcel for you on the table.
We have lots of snow in the winter.
Tom and I never do that.
Tom walked Mary to her car.
Tom said he'd be busy on Monday.
Tom took off on his bike.
Could you please explain it once more?
I felt for the light switch in the dark.
I shouldn't have yelled at you.
Have you decided where you're going to celebrate your birthday?
Tom put on a warm sweater.
I'm sorry I didn't keep my promise.
I helped Tom move the furniture.
I don't know Tom anymore.
I lived next door to Tom three years ago.
The picture you are looking at is a copy of a Picasso.
I refuse to accept it.
You'll get into trouble if your parents find out.
Call me on Monday.
We knew you'd be upset.
Tom will come tomorrow.
Something's happening.
I think we shouldn't make a decision until we hear from Tom.
I was waiting for you to tell me what to do.
What makes you think I don't like you?
I have faith in the future.
Tom will leave Boston tomorrow morning.
Tom is sharpening his pencil.
Tom is a hypochondriac.
Tom mentioned it.
Touch it.
Tom talked Mary into joining our band.
My older brother is a teacher.
When did you get up?
You knew me when I was a kid.
I am reading a play.
Tom arrived too early and Mary wasn't ready yet.
I'm not your servant.
I think that Tom is a very strange guy.
I was taking a bath when the telephone rang.
We're not dead yet.
I don't see eye to eye with him on that matter.
I think this is the best school in Boston.
I come from far away.
Tom must go back to Australia.
I'm going to miss you so much.
I'm leaving now.
Have you ever had a problem similar to this?
Are you saying that I'm a liar?
My jeans shrank after I washed them.
I lived there for a few years.
Do you want me to come with you?
My sister and I have come.
Tom wants to see us.
I know nothing about physics.
I'm wondering what'll happen if I push this button.
You must quit drinking.
We've consulted with experts.
I don't feel safe here anymore.
What am I to do now?
Sweeping the room is my daughter's job.
I have simply nothing to say about it.
I heard a scream.
What is the name of this river?
We parted on good terms.
I knew you'd come back sooner or later.
What do you think he did?
Don't look any further.
They're on good terms with their neighbors.
I was happy to help you.
I don't work on Mondays.
I got the house number wrong.
I'm always the first to arrive.
We had good intentions.
"Who is calling, please?"
Are you still living in Boston?
They're discussing their next project.
I suspect you're right.
You're too old.
What are you reading?
"Tom got tired of waiting, so he left."
Why is Tom still crying?
I was a little bit scared.
It's me that went there yesterday.
Are you bored here?
My job is to wash the dishes.
It seemed that no one was in the village.
Did you tell Tom we were coming?
Tom didn't allow me to pay for dinner.
Did you see the game yesterday?

Tom was more than three hours late.
Tom explained the reasons for his decision.
I made Tom sing.
Sleep as long as you want.
I've decided to give Tom my old bicycle.
Do you see any policeman over there?
Farragut captured New Orleans without a fight.
We weren't invited.
I hope Tom doesn't do that again.
I think you know what you should do.
How much drinking water do we have left?
Tom was different.
I won't go anywhere without you.
I always wanted to say that.
Tom finally made up his mind to marry Mary.
I don't like your dog.
Tom didn't want to speak with Mary.
I am sorry if I disturbed you.
The examinations are all over.
I went for a walk in the park.
Tom's confused.
Maybe you can help Tom.
How often do you eat chocolate?
Don't you see what's going on?
I told you Tom would understand.
I am yours and you are mine.
Tom is perverse.
How do you like it?
Why don't you go watch TV while I cook dinner?
I think I know what you need.
How much will it cost to get to the airport?
I can't eat that much.
I found the book boring.
How long have you been home?
You're persistent.
"What time is it now? ""It's 3:30."""
I am a member of the tennis club.
Is that illegal?

Is it worth fixing?
Don't put all your eggs in the same basket.
When did you learn to read?
Tom told me that I should go there by myself.
Why is math so hard?
Tom was staring up at the sky.
I really doubt it.
I don't want to be arrested.
I'll come if you want me to.
Tom is approximately Mary's age.
I really am very tired.
He and I are teachers.
He started to cry.
Are you looking for me?
I have to keep trying.
Tom thought Mary was pretty.
Did Tom borrow money from you?
The old man stroked his beard thoughtfully.
Do you still have a key to the house?
How much did you take with you?
Will you tell me the way to his house?
I'll never be rich.
"If you don't tell us, we'll kill you."
Choose between the two.
I just want to say thanks to you all.
I expect you to tell me the truth.
I'm very happy to be back.
Tom did that for the money.
Tom is a bodybuilder.
Tom is joking.
I know.
Most people who hear Tom speaking French would never guess that he wasn't a native speaker.
I knew you'd be happy.
Please pass me the salt and pepper.
"Tom tried, unsuccessfully, to smile."
Please write with a pen.
My opinion is a little different from yours.
"As strange as it may sound, what Tom said is what really happened."
Tom will die.
Were you there?
I'm unlucky.
Things keep getting worse and worse.
Do you understand what I am saying to you?
Tom offered his help to us.
Wait a sec.
There is a lot I can't do until tomorrow.
Tom took out his false teeth.
Who do you think will win the election?
Maybe Tom can do it.

She was cooking dinner at that time.
The sun is brighter than the moon.
It's up to you.
When was the last time you saw Tom?
There's your friend.
Where did you spend your summer?
Tell me when you want me to come.
Do we know you?
I behaved myself.
"When Tom found out the truth, he was furious."
She gave us a vague answer.
Are there any survivors?
Is it football season yet?
I think you want this more than you want to admit.
I feel fine.
Tom asked for a discount.
I told Tom to leave early in the morning.
It's not too far.
Just leave them there.
His nose is bleeding.
Don't ask silly questions.
I don't think Tom likes you.
I like reading mystery novels.
It'll be dangerous.
Tom got confused.
I wouldn't have said it that way.
I spoke to Tom last night.
I got punished for doing that.
My grandmother raised a family of ten.
How much is it going to cost?
"I don't eat meat, shellfish, poultry or gravy."
Where's your other brother?
You must ask for permission.
Nobody even noticed.
It's natural for Tom to get mad.
"You hate to lose, don't you?"
The girl under the tree looks sad.
You still haven't told me why you decided not to go.
They're afraid of us.
Didn't you know that Tom isn't really from Boston?
I don't care what the doctor says. I'm going to eat whatever I want.
There are no restrooms in this building.
I never could lie to Tom.
She took a lot of baggage with her.
Do you really think you can convince Tom to help you?
What did you eat in the morning?
That hotel is too expensive for me.
What book were you reading yesterday?
Are you taking pictures?
I feel lonely when you're not here.
"If I knew the answer to the question, I would tell you."
"According to the newspapers, he will be here today."
You deserve a long rest.
We've offered our support.
There's nothing more I can do here.
Tom wants to learn how to drive a tractor.
Tom knows many celebrities.
"I'm not sure, but I think I hate Tom."
Take that one.
I've found out what's been happening.
Tom waited for Mary at home.
Tom is a little skeptical.
I wish I was dead.
You missed the meeting.
Time waits for no one.
"You're Tom's students, right?"
I saw your brother the other day.
He sometimes comes to see me.
I'd never harm you.
"Tom was sitting by himself, drinking wine."
Please open the bottle.
Tom wanted to talk to Mary.
Which one will you choose?
I've been to Boston only once.
How was your meeting?
Just call Tom.
Please turn on the TV.
Where did you get these clothes?
What did you want to talk about?
Tom is in the kitchen preparing breakfast.
I know we can do it.
What did you promise to do?
Take whichever you like best.

Nothing has to happen until you're ready.
I want you to come with me to see Tom.
My cat is going to have kittens next month.
You have to come home.
I have a couple of questions I want to ask you.
The politician proposed reforms to Congress.
I'll give Tom another chance.
You must let me in.
Don't be afraid to get your feet wet.
Be merciful.
You're only three years older than me.
Tom probably thought I was a vegetarian.
None of us knew what to do.
Bring a shovel.
I managed to catch the last train.
Aren't we going do that?
Real friendship is more valuable than money.
You aren't one of us.
"Tom is in the garden, too."
Tom trusted you.
I was wrongfully punished.
Tom said he was tired and wanted to go home.
"Read the text carefully, then answer the questions."
I'm a quick learner.
The summers here are very hot.
There are no jobs here.
Tom may not have won.
I didn't know you wanted to do that.
I don't feel like sleeping right now.
Learning French isn't hard.
My computer is a lot better than yours.
Why are you so sure Tom is wrong?
I'm not a witch.
He took advantage of the opportunity.
Tom isn't a blackmailer.
Tom woke Mary up.
Tom owes me thirty bucks.
Has Tom tried it?
Tom told me he'd come.
How do you usually spend your weekends?
Go and tell Tom and Mary.
That's the snag.
We're not guilty.
Tom wasn't wearing his hat.
This sort of work calls for great patience.
Where's the best place to buy meat?
Tom asked me if I wanted another beer.
I'm doing this now.
Don't come again.
Take anything you like.
Two pages are missing from this book.
I want everybody to know that I'm not the one who did that.
Did you turn off the stove?
Tom refused to go to bed.
Tom is not likely to do that.
Tom is going to help you.
I didn't rip you off.
Where is the nearest subway station?
I am learning to speak Filipino.
Tom isn't as young as he looks.
I'll go if Tom goes.
I got a B in physics.
Why don't you like this?
Are you sure this isn't some kind of mistake?
We may need some more paper.
She asked me for help.
"Tom, do you want to go to the pool with me?"
Tom started to take off his jacket.
I can see that you're upset.
I went to the department store to do some shopping yesterday.
What do you want to eat this weekend?
You can't burn anything without oxygen.
You're worried.
I like going for a walk in the park.
I know that I won't like living in Boston.
I hate you from the bottom of my heart.
I'll thank Tom.
Everyone is different.
They ambushed the enemy.
I'll wait until October.
Tom and Mary remained friends.
Tom was very shy.
I did that in Boston.
What if you're wrong?
Do you want to stop Tom?
I will shoot.
Make a choice.
Tom looked at the floor.
I borrowed Tom's ruler.
Stop leaving your clothes all over the floor.
Not all of us can speak French.
Are you sure Tom wants to win?
I know that that's who you're looking for.
My life's an open book.
My mother really loves tea.
I didn't argue with Tom.
There's something I'd like to show you.
Which is your luggage?
Tom hasn't been there yet.
Tom told me to leave.
I'm anxious to see you.
Try to learn a little French.
You're very smart.
Please just leave.
Tom promised Mary that he'd be home by 5:30.
He is as nutty as a fruitcake.
I didn't know I was invited.
Tom refused to forgive Mary.
What do you want that for?
Who likes Tom?
You need sleep.
Why aren't you in college?
Tom brought me home.
Come here at precisely six o'clock.
I didn't need anyone's help.
Tom sat in the shade.
Tom grew his beard so he'd look older.
Eat up.
He's different from before.
Tom told me he couldn't remember what happened.
Tom picked up the phone.
He's quite a nice fellow but I don't like him.
Were you home last night?
I don't like what you're doing.
I seldom see him.
Tom is still listening.
"Get up, now!"
"Look, there's a rabbit!"
I've always distrusted Tom.
Tom is lactose intolerant.
A child is missing.
Dwight Eisenhower was the candidate for president.
I want to go abroad someday.
He's perfect at everything.
You must clean your room.
He was proud of his daughter.
Who is next?
They announced their engagement to the family.
She burned her left hand.
Be a man.
I thought so.
I'll leave right away.
I'm going to the airport.
Tom talked nonstop for a full hour.
There is a dog on the bridge.
Why should I go?
I want everyone to know what happened.
That's not what Tom wants.
Let's read Lesson 3.
You can't go out.
I asked Tom to wait a moment.
I love that movie.
Who cares whose fault it is?
What's your best guess?
This is my natural hair color.
You know that I hate spinach.
I just got bitten.
It's not contagious.
I've been spending evenings with Tom.
I personally find that very offensive.
Do your homework by yourself.
I am taking French next year.
The students were told to learn the poem by heart.
You're the most beautiful woman in the whole world.
"Recently, the weather has been bad."

Did you read this?
A bow is no use without arrows.
No one knows yet.
I think I impressed you.
Some people are still afraid.
Tom is now a multimillionaire.
Tom sat beside me in church.
Tom hasn't spoken to me yet.
A good lie is easier to believe than the truth.
I think you'd better take a look at this.
Yesterday the club elected its officers.
They must be happy.
Tom no longer loves Mary.
I didn't know why Tom was tired.
I think three would be enough.
I wanted them to win.
Let's meet the day after tomorrow.
I think you're prepared.
Do people drink tea in your country?
They put a fence around the garden.
Stop yelling. My head hurts.
I'll provide you with all the necessary information.
You aren't dressed.
Tom is a very close friend of mine.
I didn't tell Tom your name.
Tom and I are pretty good friends.
The whole class was looking at me.
I don't want to testify against Tom.
Ask Tom again.
Tom said that wasn't the reason he did that.
He asked me if I could do him a favor.
Tom came into the classroom and sat at his desk.
I've never woken up this early.
Tom was skeptical at first.
I'm unprejudiced.
Tom was sitting on the bed.
It's time to prepare dinner.
Tom says he's tired of being the one who always has to make decisions.
My grandfather was superstitious.
It wasn't necessary for you to do that.
I know a lot of people who don't own cars.
Let's take a break for lunch.
I won't try to persuade you.
Did you hear it too?
This coffee tastes great.
You are too young to travel alone.
"Though he is over eighty, he is still healthy."
Tom can speak both French and English.
We need a ladder.
We seldom see Tom do that.
Tom quickly left the room.
I'd like to speak French fluently.
Tom is in Boston on business.
Sixty delegates were elected.
"Whatever you do, don't open that door."
I don't trust myself.
Do you need something else?
I'm pretty sure Tom didn't tell me the truth.
Tom doesn't even care.
Did you look under the table?
Someone is following me.
I've made up my mind to go.
I think we should wait.
Tom didn't quite understand how to do it.
Why do you take that medicine?
Tom said he'll leave soon.
Tom and Mary are cousins.
I never cry.
The sea is calm.
She gave him a sweater.
Everybody was worried about Tom.
I'll make an exception in your case.
Tom hates his parents.
I didn't mean to confuse him.
Tom turned on the small lamp on his bedside table.
I need you to call me.
Where did Tom buy that sweater?
Why does this have to be so hard?
We'll be well paid.
Yesterday I played tennis for the first time.
Tom likes olives.
I've read hundreds of books.
I think you know them both.
What do you love? What do you hate?
Please pull down the blinds.
His story made us laugh.
They kept me waiting for an hour.
The Panama Canal connects the Atlantic with the Pacific.
I wasn't able to lift that box.
It is their only choice.
Tom didn't do anything to help me.
I think this is a mistake.
How dare you call me stupid?
This decision is final.
Why couldn't I be the one you kissed?
Tom threw Mary's book into the fire.
Have you found an apartment yet?
His job has to do with telephones.
It's doubtful if Tom can win.
I advised Tom to learn French.
I will be here from Monday to Thursday.
I'm not a great photographer.
I was absent from school because I was sick.
Leave me alone so I can get some sleep.
Tom asked me to help Mary find her contact lens.
"Do you want to hug me or kiss me? ""I want to do both."""
Tell us where they are.
I used to complain a lot.
A true friend would've helped me.
It is necessary for you to go there immediately.
Am I doing it right?
What time do you think he'll come back?
My father is free this afternoon.
Don't you trust your instincts?
Tom tightened the bolts.
Tom doesn't have many photos of himself as a baby.
I'm not busy.
I'm going to stop by your office tomorrow.
Tom says he doesn't feel well today.
We have to find out why this happened.
Tom doesn't think about others.
I want to sell it.
I think he likes you.
Tom has a hangover.
Thanks for helping us do that.
Unbelievable!
Tom wasn't moving.
I'm only a freshman.
Why did you lend Tom so much money?
She doesn't like wearing heels.
He made a lot of money.
I thanked Tom for his support.
The robber ran away when the policeman saw him.
You should learn from your mistakes.
"You've all seen the photos, haven't you?"
His grandfather died of cancer last year.
Tom didn't come with us to Boston.
Not every question deserves an answer.
I asked Tom not to wear his sister's clothes.
Tom didn't know what he wanted.
I think I've heard that somewhere before.
We love coffee.
Can I go to Boston with you?
I don't know where to park.
Tell me what happened that night.
He's my friend. Do you know him?
Weren't you surprised by Tom's answer?
This room has air conditioning.
I speak French very well.
Why are we fighting?
Could you give me change out of a hundred-dollar bill?
Tom has a cousin who is a doctor.
I can read minds.
I don't have the number.
I can't do this.
I'm your brother.
I'm not busy anymore.
I'd like to go out with her.
Tom often thought about Mary.
Tom turned up the volume.
Tom might be home.
Thanks for the help.
I had the same problems.
Keep an eye on him.
Tom was driving the car.
I knew you wouldn't get caught.
Tom and Mary didn't say anything to each other.
Tom wanted something else to do.
Do you understand the situation?
Tom passed away three days ago.
I am so exhausted!
Tom didn't need it.
Have you ever swum in a lake?
I need a room for six nights.
I've lost a lot of weight since I've been on a diet.
I didn't show it to Tom.
Please phone me before you come.
I have a skin condition.
Are you sure you're ready for this?
Tom already knows you want to talk to him.
You can go.
May I borrow your lawnmower?
It was boring.
Thirteen people were injured.
Has your father come yet?
Do you really not know?
You're the one who told me to do this.
Tom gave Mary a hand.
I hope you'll get better soon.
I'm meeting Tom in an hour.
Tom will go.
I know I'm replaceable.
Tom is either mistaken or he's a liar.
Do you want to join me?
You don't know what it's like to lose your entire family in a war.
Do you know what Tom really meant?
"He's busy, so he can't meet you."
She will care for you from now on.
Did I get it right?
I had no visitors today.
Tom and Mary aren't afraid.
I have a present for Tom.
I definitely agree with Tom.
You look fantastic.
You've betrayed us all.
Come here.
How many pens do you have?
There's so much I want to say to you.
Don't say a word to anyone.
You should apologize to her.
Tom really likes basketball.
Tom is a worse liar than Mary.
Hold on.
Tom told me he'd been forgiven.
You're just jealous.
I've read it.
We need to hire more people.
Didn't you know Tom was a Canadian?
She has very few close friends.
Can we stop it?
I helped Tom a little.
Tom wasn't as surprised as Mary was.
Both of us are from Australia.
Tom says he can pay for it.
They stole apples from my orchard.
Tom will win this game.
You can't save me.
Tom is going to have to verify this.
You aren't fat.
Go straight ahead until you reach the church.
I must say I'm a bit disappointed.
Tom allowed Mary to come in.
I want you to admit you were wrong.
Where will you stay in Boston?
Tom gets bored quickly.
Your skirt is too short.
No one noticed you.
You seem to know Tom pretty well.
Tom is very afraid of Mary.
I'm sitting alone in my house.
Do you really think I'd drink that?
They entertained us at dinner.
She is playing with her friends.
Let go of me!
Tom thinks you're doing that wrong.
What I need is a little more time.
Tom flipped the coin.
Is the exam today?
You've helped me a lot.
Is that a compliment?
I don't think this was such a good idea.
Are you scared?
Can you and I talk?
I hate living alone.
I want you to say you're not going back to Boston.
I have it at home.
Tom did better than Mary.
"I used to sing with Tom, Mary and John."
I hope Tom won't tell Mary.
"If I wasn't so hungry, I wouldn't eat this."
It'll cost at least a hundred pesos.
Tom died.
Tom went into the room and closed the door.
Tom didn't think Mary heard him.
That is no fault of Tom's.
I thanked both Tom and Mary.
He is a member of the committee.
He seemed very surprised when I told him about it.
I wanted Tom to come to Boston for Christmas.
I'd like you to be more punctual.
I forgot something.
Yours is over there.
I want to buy a dog.
Tom rarely smiles.
Why aren't you ready?
You'd better look at it.
I'd have come if you'd invited me.
Tom said he wasn't thirty.
"Unfortunately, I don't have any money with me now."
Tom didn't seem to know the answer.
I asked them to call you.
I've found the answer.
Tom left this for you.
We've got this.
Tom told Mary that he wouldn't cry.
Is this good or bad?
Tom says he won't come.
What kind of a madman would say something like that?
What seems to be the cause of the trouble?
I don't know how to buy a ticket.
Tom got a job as assistant manager.
Do you hear the birds singing?
I'm biracial.
Tom could've been killed.
She weighs fifty five kilograms.
Tom swims very well.
You'll have to wait.
Why did you want us to come here?
That was unfair.
My shoes are gone.
I wish I hadn't looked out the window.
How did you know I'd say yes?
Don't draw attention to yourself.
Tom is a CIA agent.
The motor overheats.
This proves my theory.
What else did you see?
Tom couldn't look me straight in the face.
There's a gang of tough kids on this street.
Apples are the best fruit.
I was at the hospital a couple of days ago.
I'd rather have ice cream.
We never opened that window.
I've been waiting for you a long time.
Tom fastened his seatbelt.
My mother is certain to say no.
One hundred years is called a century.
I tried not to panic.
This food is gluten-free.
We've got to warn the others.
Tom never tells us anything.
He'll never beat me.
Tom eats only raw vegetables.
What do you like to read?
Tom wore a V-neck T-shirt.
The food here is inexpensive and delicious.
Tom is no longer my student.
Would you like me to make you a sandwich?
"If you take this medicine, you'll feel better."
The stars appeared.
I'm Tom's driver.
This is my father's room.
I wasn't entirely sure myself.
Tom said that you were hungry.
Tom made me smile.
Are you here to see Tom?
Admission to the show is by ticket only.
May I sit here?
We must take that chance.
Tom asked Mary if she had a dog.
Tom is going to go as well.
Shut up and let me think.
Everyone here knows that you don't eat pork.
Are you going to do it?
Visit my webpage and find out more about me.
I thought Tom would ask Mary to do that.
Did you buy it?
I love you more than anyone else.
Tom said that he'd never ever do that.
I told you Tom was dangerous.
Have you ever fed a crocodile?
We know that you're very rich.
Thanks for doing this.
Tom didn't want to eat.
Look at that picture.
My grandmother has become old.
I knew Tom was afraid of Mary.
Everybody needs to do that.
We stayed at a hotel by the lake.
We've come here to help you do that.
That's disgusting.
I found the empty box.
I know exactly where I'm going.
Tom says he's working very hard.
Are you free tomorrow night?
I found out how to solve the problem.
I know that Tom has been hurt.
Tom is a year younger than Mary.
We've talked about this many times before.
I don't know how I know.
Tom wasn't sleeping when I got home.
Tom said you liked baseball.
What is the president's plan?
How big a box do you need?
I'm not doing that.
I didn't know about his plan.
I want to get a sightseeing visa.
Your question is illogical.
The earthquake smashed everything.
I would like to drink a coffee.
The weather is just perfect.
I think about that every single day.
I'm selfish.
We have to go by taxi.
Did you read the letter I sent you?
Don't even joke about that.
How long do you think the negotiations will take?
Tom used to never drink milk.
You aren't wrong.
Do you know what's happening right now?
Thanks for spending so much time helping us.
"Tom told us you were Canadian, too."
You must act more wisely.
Do you know how to ski?
We grow vegetables in our garden.
I'd like to talk to you about what happened at school yesterday.
There's something wrong with my car.
"If your illness becomes worse, call in a specialist."
May I go home?
Please call the FBI immediately.
Death doesn't scare me.
You make it sound very simple.
Do you know how to program?
Have you ever seen an angel?
Am I not right?
Are you sure Tom won't be here?
Tom didn't know what Mary was going to buy.
I didn't participate in the discussion.
He knew the story already.
It didn't cost that much.
We'll decide later.
Abandon ship.
When will you be back home?
Tom is easily influenced.
Tom won't wait until we get there.
Did you get Tom's message?
I'd appreciate it if you'd help me.
Stay here until I get back.
They're interesting.
I especially like the smell of lilacs.
Tom's desperate.
I'm beginning to get used to this.
Tom bought a used car.
I've known Tom longer than you've been alive.
"By the way, what is the matter with him?"
Tom stole the ring.
She hugged him.
Tom is already home.
Bring me the scissors.
I still don't understand.
Tom doesn't eat anything except bread.
I don't have a key.
Are you in trouble?
Tom grew up in a small fishing village.
Tom said he wouldn't wait.
He doesn't look very healthy.
He speaks English as fluently as any student in his class.
"Tom eats asparagus, but his brother doesn't."
It's time to go home.
I'm not sure what Tom means.
What do you think of when you look at this photo?
I don't think that Tom helped Mary.
Can you please sign this document?
They wanted to steal the car.
Tom isn't naive.
"Come sit with us, Tom."
Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone.
There was no hot water.
I paid for my purchases in cash.
Tell me what you see.
Do you like her songs?
Do you think Tom has been treated unfairly?
You should put aside some money for a rainy day.
Tom is the best chess player in our class.
Do you want me to buy this for you?
"Last night was great, wasn't it?"
This is the largest temple that I've ever seen.
Tom is preparing to leave.
Let me out!
Tom tiptoed past his parents' bedroom.
That was a terrible joke.
Are you busy tomorrow afternoon?
We're not going to let that happen.
I think that's the best plan.
Don't let me die.
Do you think that's going to be easy?
Tom manages a hotel.
His wife opened the door for him.
Skyscrapers are beautiful structures.
Which way is the beach?
Tom and Mary used to be best friends.
"Tom said he was ill, which was a lie."
I need to be in Boston next Monday.
I'd rather do that on Monday.
No one comes to visit us anymore.
The two boys are cousins.
Do your children drink milk?
I'll tell my wife.
Tom slept with his shoes on.
Tom and John pretended to be brothers.
I will follow your advice.
"You enjoy working here, don't you?"
Tom has been going out with Mary for about three years.
She is evidently sick.
I thought you'd be angry.
I felt the wind blowing on my face.
Where did you get all those keys?
Tom never told me anything.
The alarm rang and everyone rushed out.
How much money did Tom borrow from you?
Don't you have another one that's a little larger?
We went early to make certain that we could get seats.
Why's your name not on the list?
I'll go when I'm ready.
I don't have time to help you with your homework.
Tom never says anything.
They both can speak French.
How old do you think Tom is?
I don't think I'm stubborn.
I don't think Tom knows that I love Mary.
I want to forget her.
I think I'm going to be arrested.
Are you still here?
I go to school with him.
We finally arrived at the lake.
Everybody is watching you.
Take it upstairs.
I usually sleep with the lights on.
Who is Tom talking about?
Tom caught a cold.
Tom lit the stove.
"Tom, where are you?"
Don't leave the key in the lock.
I'll get you something to eat.
Tom is an outcast.
It's fun and exciting.
It was the first gold medal that she had won.
I won't do anything stupid.
My dad died when I was thirteen.
I have plenty of theories.
Thanks for your help.
What time does the market open?
The medicine made me sleepy.
Tom hasn't said anything.
"Could you come in here, please."
I'll get over this with or without your help.
An apple fell off the tree.
I'm not done with you yet.
That was the most interesting film that we had ever seen.
He has just been appointed the U.S. Ambassador to Japan.
That almost sounds like a threat.
I had to crawl under the fence.
I'd like to change my room.
I ran downstairs.
I didn't think you'd talk to me.
They want Tom back.
We'd all be very grateful if that happened.
I'll give you a call later.
Can I take your order now?
Tom doesn't have much time left.
I think Tom said he'd be back.
He does well in physics.
I suddenly realized what was happening.
What book were you reading yesterday?
Let go of the rope.
I'm 100% sure of that.
"You've changed your mind, haven't you?"
You've gotten better.
Tom doesn't always understand what's going on.
I thought Tom said something else.
Do you think Tom will be absent?
Why do you think Tom doesn't like it?
This is an unusual situation.
That's pretty normal.
Tom ran past Mary.
I didn't want to look stupid.
Are you no longer in pain?
The old man spoke to me in French.
How long can you wait?
Tom is the best swimmer I know.
"When Tom told Mary to feel right at home, he was secretly hoping that she'd go and wash up the dishes in the kitchen."
I have to go.
I didn't ask.
Are we ready for it?
She doesn't have any brothers.
I don't waste time.
I won't sing tonight.
Tom is using an external hard disk.
Were you married at that time?
They really did it.
Which one do you think I should buy?
Exhale slowly.
I didn't lose much time.
You are impossible to deal with.
This matter is very urgent.
There's another reason.
I don't like school.
"Hey, look at that."
Tom can't afford it.
He should get to the office in an hour.
This door locks by itself.
My mother prepared me for the bad news.
Tom held a knife to Mary's throat.
"Come on, we're almost there."
The image isn't in focus.
Tom sent one to me.
I never thought I'd be happy to see you.
This is an important task.
We killed time playing cards.
Are you done with your homework?
I was calm until I saw the syringe.
I need those car keys.
I bet Tom will be late.
Do you think Tom will succeed?
Do you drink a lot of wine?
I didn't know that Tom had three children.
Tom sent me to help you.
When did you have time to do all this?
I know that the police suspect me.
I just want to know why you brought me here.
It wasn't his.
"Tom wanted to sleep late, but was unable to."
Tom and I'll do all we can.
Tom translated the document into French.
You will always be there.
Start reading where you left off.
Can I have your phone number?
Are you selling your car?
I want to be able to speak Cantonese.
"I don't want to get married, but I want to have kids."
What have they done to you?
Stop shooting.
How can I find Tom?
"You may be right, but we have a slightly different opinion."
She showed him the photo.
Tom wasn't ready for what happened.
I think I'm in love.
Now you owe me.
I think you know we need to hurry.
You've got to answer the question.
She studies in the library after school.
There are four rooms in my house.
Hold it!
Describe your ideal breakfast.
I really am busy.
You'll be able to see Tom tomorrow.
Your hands are filthy.
Tom just told us about what happened.
He earns three times more than me.
Find yourself a decent suit.
It'll be difficult to complete this report by Monday.
Do you have a theory?
I don't recognize the number.
Don't blame yourselves for what happened.
You have a big nose.
I didn't know you enjoyed doing that.
Tell Tom you don't need it.
I wasn't sure you'd be happy to see me.
Tom thinks that Mary is being unnecessarily cautious.
I might go to Boston with Tom.
I won't forget you.
Will you come with us?
I hope that I don't get killed.
Inhale through your nose.
Didn't you know Tom didn't have to do that?
You can't stop Tom.
Tom offered to help me.
Tom has decided to come.
She might look more attractive with a little make-up.
Tom has asked Mary to marry him three times.
I just wanted to calm Tom down.
Come back to Boston.
Tom asked Mary for some money.
I washed the car.
I ate quickly.
You're both wrong.
How did you escape?
Who told you Tom was sick?
I'm going to get some sleep.
You must meet with her.
Tom does that well.
Why did you want to see me?
Tom was working as hard as possible.
I've always had that problem.
Tom slept through the earthquake.
Tom looks like his brother.
It's a delicate problem.
I don't think they liked me.
I know that you're in trouble.
Where were you on the night of October 20th?
That was really difficult.
I'll explain it again.
They both want the same thing.
Tom liked it in Boston.
Didn't you know where Tom wanted to go?
Laughter is contagious.
Tom doesn't think it's disgusting to eat certain insects.
I have to ask you some questions.
"What do you do here, Tom?"
Could you translate that for me?
I wonder if Tom refused to do that.
I can't bear it any longer.
I advised him to take a rest.
I think the reason Tom is so good at French is that he watches a lot of French movies.
The website is down.
He sells cars.
Do you think such a thing is possible?
Health is the most important thing.
I can't cook well.
It wasn't Tom who kissed Mary.
Tom is sad.
I don't need anybody's permission to do that.
They will come.
Tom left school an hour ago.
I don't want to go outside.
When did it stop snowing?
You've lost some blood.
I'll never forget your kindness as long as I live.
"If you need anything, let me know."
She used to love him.
Everyone is scared.
I don't believe in love.
Tom didn't say anything else.
I think Tom is awake.
Tom works for a hospital.
Where did Tom get that sweater?
I didn't know you wouldn't do that.
Tom hasn't read this book yet.
Many peasants died during the drought.
Where were you three years ago?
What did you say?
I'm just a little tired.
You need to leave.
Do you think Tom can help you?
Tom didn't want to disappoint his mother.
I keep it in the attic.
I thought Tom had answered all your questions.
Nobody will believe you.
Turn the sound off.
The danger was not apparent.
I thought I understood you.
I need to get them back.
Tom told me where you live.
Tom is good at manipulating people.
Where are they living?
Tom's death wasn't a suicide.
Don't forget to charge your cell phone.
We'll cross the river in a boat.
My French is fairly good.
That was my idea.
Tom made his children go to bed early.
You look awful. What happened?
Tom dated a girl named Mary.
I usually play tennis.
They belong to the chess club.
I think I've done enough.
It's more of an art than a science.
That's exactly what Tom thinks.
Good luck. You're going to need it.
Now what do I have to do?
I'm going to make a drink.
Tom and I went back to the bar.
I'm happier than you.
You'll miss the train.
Don't get that close to the fire.
I know Tom wants to become a pediatrician.
Tom knows who they are.
Tom acted like he was drunk.
Tom really speaks French well.
Tom is in his room listening to music.
Many people were there.
How did you know that that would happen?
Tom called to say thanks.
Tom said yesterday was the happiest day of his life.
Do you want to take a look?
Let's bounce.
Help came too late.
We have to paint the bathroom ceiling.
You remind me of somebody.
She's a glamorous girl.
"Merry Christmas, everybody!"
He doesn't lie.
We'll let you know the result within a week.
Tom was surprised by how well Mary spoke French.
Tom has an interesting background.
Don't you trust your instincts?
Tom has lots of toys.
She likes to walk alone.
Tom wants to know the truth.
You are the best.
"I'm not going to be there, either."
Tom is going to recover.
I'm glad you thought of that.
I know that Tom isn't afraid of snakes.
Tom didn't have to explain it to me.
He dressed very modestly.
They look very busy.
Tom is hoping Mary will forgive him.
A female kangaroo carries its young in the pouch.
They don't seem to be very pleased.
Tom got involved in a fight.
I wonder why Tom didn't do that.
I used to do that all the time.
Have you made any friends yet?
I can't believe I just said that!
Just don't kiss me.
I promise I won't let you down.
Do you like Tom's tattoo?
Don't you dare touch anything.
Where is the dog?
Do you see what I'm talking about?
I don't want to interfere.
Don't let him climb on the bed.
Tom is used to the heat.
They usually get home later than us.
Students never really study seriously until just before the exams.
Do you know why you're here?
I fooled everybody.
They want to come.
Do you think Tom was bored?
I think this is important.
You still haven't told me what your phone number is.
Tom didn't protest.
You will be rewarded.
"I waited for an hour, but he didn't appear."
Tom's hair is all silver.
I need help from someone.
Ask Tom and he'll tell you the same thing.
Are you sure you want to know?
You're too idealistic.
Tom doesn't want to see anybody today.
Tom seems to be cold.
The boy passed the time by flinging stones into the lake.
Did you ask your father?
You must've thought I was an idiot.
This is what'll happen.
We need rest.
What happened to Tom wasn't his fault.
Say hello to Tom.
"I was leaving home, when it started to rain."
Tell Tom he has to do everything Mary asks him to do.
What's your proposal?
Tom has kept his promise.
I just don't think I'm successful enough.
I have just cleaned my room.
Next time I'll have to do that by myself.
You'll regret that!
You can tell us.
Was that your question?
Why do you keep looking at your watch?
Where will the meeting be?
Have you ever been a soldier?
Some children are swimming in the river.
I didn't understand what had happened.
The shoes were made of some soft stuff that looked like leather.
The bottle is empty.
Tom wanted to lose weight.
You are a beautiful woman.
I like red meat.
We may need it soon.
It isn't possible.
Tom wanted to ask you some questions.
He is lying on the sofa.
I'd better turn the engine off.
I'm doing my homework.
Ask Tom what to do next.
Do you have a map?
I need to borrow some money to buy some medicine for my mother.
Do you want proof?
Tom told Mary not to be late.
Is Tom going with you?
Has the witness been sworn in?
I've seen it before.
There's no need for violence.
I thought you were never going to come back.
Many people lost their jobs.
Tom is wanted by the police.
I hope you'll come.
Ask Tom how he got here.
Tom was eating by himself.
Tom needs to be informed.
He pushed the emergency button.
He seems angry.
It looks like Tom has gotten into trouble.
Tom is about to leave.
"Hand me the hammer, will you?"
Those girls look like guys.
I don't know any of her students.
"Well, let's get to work."
Tom saw Mary laugh.
The price of eggs is going up.
Compare your sentence with the one on the blackboard.
"Do it now, Tom."
I hid in the woods all day.
I trust Tom more than anyone.
Tom was unable to help me.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Advertising is the driving force behind commerce.
Tom is just trying to help you.
He's helping me.
Tom thinks he's better than Mary.
Are you ready to eat?
We'll be OK.
"You didn't really mean that, did you?"
"Are you frightened, Tom?"
Thanks for asking.
Tom won't help us.
"If that happens again, call me."
It's very important to us.
Tom was complaining of back pain.
I don't know how to milk a goat.
I felt betrayed.
"If I were rich, I'd buy it."
"Whose socks are these? ""They are my sister's."""
Let's play baseball.
I want to visit Australia someday.
Tom did something very stupid.
Mary is a brave woman.
Tom unbuckled his seatbelt.
There was nothing for us to do.
"Believe me, I don't want to die."
I am bound to him by a close friendship.
Go home and change.
This isn't your place.
Did you have a good time?
You're too slow.
Tom ran back inside.
Even Tom doesn't know about it yet.
Everything was fine until Tom started drinking.
I should've stayed with you.
The police broke up the crowd.
The snow prevented me from going there.
Tom's unarmed.
Tom rehearsed for two days.
I don't like what you're wearing.
You need to be careful.
Tom isn't rude.
Perhaps you should ask Tom.
Three hours should be enough time.
I just got tenure.
He has left already.
Aren't you hot?
How can we let this happen?
We won today.
No one knew the answer.
All of my kids want to learn French.
There's a party going on in the next room.
Put that down.
His aunt looks young.
Are these the glasses you're looking for?
Many people became Mormons.
I don't know if I should turn left or right.
I'll notify you when it's ready.
Tom lied to us.
You know that's not true.
Tom returned to his hotel room.
I visited Australia three years ago.
Did you agree to do it?
I need to make better use of my free time.
I knew you'd take Tom's side.
I need to exchange dollars for pesos.
"Will it rain? ""It's hard to say."""
Tom talked to a lot of people.
We've been dating for a while.
Only Tom stayed.
You're observant.
It was too much for Tom.
I didn't enjoy that.
All the houses were shaking and alarms were ringing everywhere.
You know very well how it happened.
I've always trusted you.
Someone has walked off with my pencil.
I don't know what came over me.
I don't even know you.
Why is no one eating?
Tom doesn't know who's going to win.
Tom's sister is a devout Christian.
Why don't you come over to my place?
I didn't want to be a burden.
I don't want your help.
I was hired.
We expect a lot from Tom.
I need to change.
I was just about to do that.
"Well, I should be going."
Tom has a drawer full of USB cables.
I don't think that Tom knows when Mary will be there.
Tom said Mary wouldn't let him do that.
Somebody say something.
Tom kneeled down on one knee.
We went to the park to take pictures.
I think you might need my help.
I'm having a bad day.
We're going to keep doing this until someone tells us that we can't.
I took my little sister by the hand when we crossed the street.
Mary has a new boyfriend.
I have to go to sleep.
I don't want to be late.
I'll wait by the elevators.
Don't ever change.
Tom didn't have to go there himself.
They didn't see anything.
Mary stretched the clothesline between the trees.
Any problem can be solved if you are persistent and patient.
I don't know how to help Tom.
Tom always asks me the same question.
I never really liked Tom much.
I'll watch Tom.
I didn't know how to do it.
Their dining room is very spacious.
I thought that you said that Tom and Mary were married.
I've promised Tom I'd do that tomorrow.
Who did Tom sell his car to?
There's no other answer.
You're not the only one who doesn't believe Tom.
I'll take it if you don't mind.
Don't waste so much food.
Tom is probably somewhere in the park.
I failed the exam because I didn't study.
Why did you marry him?
I came by taxi.
Are you having any difficulty sleeping?
We want to know the facts.
When did you buy that hat?
I'm not in a position to discuss that.
Tom needed money desperately.
What are they looking for?
We've all lived in Australia since we were born.
That's precisely what I wanted to hear.
My grandfather used to say that.
Tom asked Mary many questions about life in Boston.
She managed to learn to drive a car.
You shouldn't have worried so much.
We had a short vacation in February.
Did you see something else?
The children played ball.

Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones.
I'll visit you tomorrow.
You didn't answer the question.
Tom looked right at Mary.
I won't let them hurt you.

You're in good shape.
Go to your spot.

What is it called?
That should be kept between us.
I'd love to find out why she said so.

Are you looking for Tom?
Tom is not happy to see Mary.
I'd like to have an answer.
You were wrong about that.

I'm fairly certain that we're being watched.
Tom cut his finger.
Did you get home safe and sound?

Let's not forget the beer.
I should've stayed longer.
I have your number.
Lay it on the table.
It was too difficult.
I get up at 6:30.
He took poison by mistake.
I looked down at the floor.
"Be serious, modest, polite, calm and truthful. Don't say too much, and never talk about things that you don't understand."
My friend sent me a letter asking how I was.
I appreciate everything you've done for us.
The teacher let the boy go home.
Her father is a policeman.
I've eaten almost nothing.
These shoes are way too small for me.

I know a guy who goes fishing almost every weekend.
I crashed.
Do Tom and Mary have children?
"I'm thinking of going to Australia, too."
How dare you call me a racist?
Tom wasn't hard to find.
I hope Tom won't laugh at me.
I ran to my mother.
Who do you think we are?
Tom did that for Mary.
Are they talking about you?
Thank you for all you did for me that time.
Do you guys want to walk?
I thought you read my resume.
Don't try to leave town.

Tom has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
Is the phone ringing?
Tom threw a snowball at Mary.
Help me hide this money.
"You're fluent in French, right?"
"He isn't at home, is he?"
I've got a hunch something might be happening tonight.
I don't completely trust you.
He is a kind person.
Tom believes the system is broken.
It's nothing extraordinary.
Tom says he feels fine.
I don't see the relevance.
I want to be sure.
I'm going to tell you everything.
I'm not blaming anyone.
Go sit down.
I had to stop.
Tom didn't notice it.
Do not forget to turn the light off before you go to bed.
A lot can happen in three hours.
Tom believed everything that Mary said.
I was in Boston all last month.
Didn't you know that I used to live in Boston?
I want Tom to go away and leave me in peace.
Tom and Mary held hands.
Someone stole Tom's money.
I put the book down and turned on the light.
I have no idea what Tom ate for breakfast.
I need to be alone to think.
I've hired Tom.
Do you still want tea?
I don't think I'd like doing that.
Did you really tell Tom that?
Don't leave out a single detail.
Can you stay for a few days?
Tom answered all the questions that Mary asked him.
They walked out.
We're surviving.
He became financially independent.
The pain hasn't gone away.
I like playing golf.
Your French is impeccable.
I had an argument with Tom.
Tom has three boys and a girl.
We depend on you.
I knew I shouldn't do that.
I am trying to help him.
They'll get married next month.
I can't make that decision without talking to Tom first.
I come from Japan.
I've got a job for you.
Tom has been taken to the hospital.
People need love.
Don't show this to Tom.
How do I know you're telling me the truth?
I know who your father is.
You must have known what she meant.
It's not an urgent matter.
Tom put his money in the safe.
Dress warmly.
Everyone inside the building felt the earthquake.
I'm a lawyer.
I wish I knew what was going on.
I know it for sure.
I knocked on the door again.
Tom isn't afraid to get his clothes dirty.
You needn't to be afraid.
I like Tom.
Is Tom a Christian?
My clothes are dirty.
Who's that girl waving at you?
This makes me angry.
What a colossal waste of time!
Why doesn't Tom answer?
Why do you need it?
It's not safe to jump out of a moving truck.
"Tom is at the bus stop, waiting for Mary."
May I go home?
Tom wants to teach French.
He didn't participate in the discussion.
I don't forget my friends.
Does that belong to Tom?
Do you want some cherry pie?
I didn't know Tom had already done that.
Would you risk it?
The doctor advised me not to eat too much.
This rule can't be applied to every situation.
You've got to move.
He grows tomatoes in his garden.
I think Tom should go.
Tom doesn't like playing tennis with Mary.
That's reason enough.
He made it clear that he had no intention of becoming a professional football player.
Tom started walking.
The old man leaned on his staff.
I told you it wouldn't work.
Can you tell Tom to call me?
You should come visit me when you have time.
Did Tom notice?
Close the window before going to sleep.
Which is the platform for the Boston train?
She ordered the book from England.
Fantastic!
I know where you did that.
I don't get paid.
I didn't rescue anybody.
I'm fighting.
"I'm not an adult, either."
Where can I buy a shirt like that?
I stood.
I knew Tom spoke a little French.
I don't think I can be happy here.
Tom made Mary cry.
I'll see you in a couple days.
This will save you a lot of trouble.
May I use your phone?
I saw Tom take your keys.
I'll pray for Tom.
They pushed back the attackers.
I'm sure the guy you saw wasn't Tom.
She is not here yet.
Do you think we made the wrong decision?
I feel like laughing.
Gambling is illegal.
Do you have an explanation?
Do you still love Tom?
There's no reason to change our plans.
Nobody ever helps me.
"You like it, huh?"
I don't expect anything from you.
Do you have a printer?
Tomorrow is my birthday.
There are also people who like spring better than autumn.
I saw the video.
I've got nothing to give you.
She reached her goal.
Tom is the smartest kid in our class.
Can you please tell me where the restaurant is?
There are two main characters in this story.
You lied to Tom and me.
I don't believe anything those people say.
Dad bought a book for me.
I didn't have to pay.
You are not to leave your room.
My jeans have shrunk.
I refused treatment.
Tom and Mary went together.
Tell your mother about the trip.
We're married now.
Tom needed to be told not do that.
It's time for us to go home.
We still have a lot more work to do.
My brother went to the United States to study law.
I'll tell you why.
Where do you usually go skiing?
Please tell me Tom is kidding.
Did you say yes?
Tom reluctantly went outside.
Tom's father is rich.
I'm always the first to arrive.
Tom is always like that.
I didn't order this.
I call Tom a lot.
He took the heavy box down from the shelf.
There are no direct flights to Boston from here.
Here's your beer.
He spread butter on the bread.
The mission was successful.
Tom isn't serious.
Tom wanted Mary to play the violin.
I have no idea what I should say.
Tom must concentrate.
Try to be home before dark.
Tom doesn't know what Mary is looking for.
"He had to leave the city, so he moved to Berlin."
Press the red button if something strange happens.
She always says no.
He still remembers you.
Come inside.
I will make a man out of you.
Tom wasn't at the concert.
They can leave.
They now have three children.
I never imagined so many people would come to my party.
They found us.
Save Tom.
We've been waiting on you.
Tell Tom to help Mary.
You should put your ideas in writing.
Tom doesn't know where his umbrella is.
What've you been doing?
Tom is too young to go to school.
Who taught you this?
Go back to bed.
No one but Tom did that.
It looks like an apple.
He put on clean trousers.
Leave my house.
Why don't we do what's right?
You're still young.
Tom was afraid of hurting Mary.
Are you through with the newspaper?
I'm sorry I broke my promise.
Do you mean us?
I've always dated older women.
Your car's ready.
There's no point arguing with Tom.
I've decided on going.
I think that Tom isn't a very good singer.
She bought a tea set.
Do you want to sit?
I think you're weird.
Don't make promises that you can't keep.
He doesn't know English at all.
How far is it to the next town?
Tom didn't expect to win.
Go to bed.
I came yesterday.
I see Tom and Mary.
Did you take the money?
Why are you angry with him?
Good morning. How are you?
Do you have children of your own?
"If you want to know the truth, ask Tom."
Have you ever been arrested?
I want you to see what you've done.
I told Tom to go there.
How could I do that?
I don't need your protection.
I just saw a ghost.
You don't seem very pleased.
You seem very nervous this morning.
Tom and Mary were wrong.
I'd better run.
They hated you.
Your room is at the end of the corridor.
This is the biggest car in the world.
Are you having a breakdown?
I can't get touch in with him.
Aren't you going to kiss me?
The sickness is taking its course.
My family is wealthy.
How often does Tom set the table?
"Can we come, too?"
I've known Tom since he was three years old.
Show me again.
Who hurt you?
You might have an accident.
It's cold out there.
Tom says Mary was happy.
He found the box under the table.
He told me that his father was a doctor.
Tom came to Boston hoping to find a job.
I wanted a jacket.
I just do what I'm told.
Tom weighs 130 pounds.
Tom burned his fingers on the stove.
Tom has been to Boston once.
I know this part of the city well.
Tom and I were both wrong.
Hold the vase with both hands.
"Tom is sitting in the garden, reading the newspaper."
I just wanted you to know that.
Boston is almost three hours from here.
The royal palace was built on a hill.
You don't want to say no to Tom.
We only have one day left.
I went to the supermarket with my mom.
"Give me the bill, please."
That's my real name.
Why didn't you try to do that?
You may not smoke in the elevator.
Sunday follows Saturday.
"Now that you know what the problem is, how long do you think it'll take to fix it?"
I will pick you up around six.
She wants a new hat.
I hope that I don't get punished.
What are you hinting at?
Do you understand what's going on?
Tom told me a lot about you.
How many soldiers did you see?
Why's Tom still here?
He was very pleased with the result.
I told Tom we're friends.
Forget I said that.
Don't tell Tom where I am.
"Give us two knives and four forks, please."
He went duck hunting.
I think both of them are right.
There are more girls than boys in our school.
Does anyone else have any advice?
I'm so happy that you're here!
I'll keep on trying.
We don't know her.
I was really nervous.
I don't like him either.
"Besides teaching English, he writes novels."
Tom is much more fluent in French than I am.
Show me what you bought.
I'm finishing my homework.
It's close.
Why not ask Tom?
I'll call you.
The bus that Tom was on was involved in an accident.
I want a green one.
Where did he go?
The judge's decision is final.
He obviously lied.
Tom has finished.
They went on an expedition to the Antarctic.
I don't know much about your family.
I don't remember you asking me to do that.
Just trust me.
A cow has a long tail.
I knew you were Canadian.
Tom has brought presents for all of us.
Tom quickly learned how to swim.
You'd better send for a doctor.
I'll discuss it with my wife.
Have you found Tom yet?
Did you decide to go to Japan?
Everybody had to do that.
I have three times more money than you do.
Do you study any foreign language?
We got the news.
Tom is in my class.
He managed to escape.
We are sorry we are unable to accept your request.
We got into his car and went to the sea.
Passengers can take a certain amount of baggage on the airplane.
An old man sat next to me on the bus.
She could not keep back a smile.
I didn't know I was invited.
I don't want your sympathy.
I always kept my promises.
I don't see what the problem is.
Go to the park.
You've got to speak French.
Pick your friends carefully.
Tom prefers tea to coffee.
"Tom was speaking in French, so I couldn't understand him."
I can't feel my legs.
You're smarter than Tom.
Tom took one last look around the room before he left.
I'm a foreigner.
No one wants to go there.
I hope I succeed.
What's the moral of this story?
Tom sent Mary a postcard from Australia.
"At first, the boy didn't pay much attention to my advice."
Tom won't care.
Tom had a bandage on his left hand.
We used up the shampoo.
The teacher began to ask us questions.
Tom hated his parents.
Tom never quarrels with his wife in public.
Is French difficult?
We've been here since 2013.
Tom said Mary is busy.
Please ask whether they have this book at the library.
Tom doesn't like cats.
This mobile phone is really expensive.
Are you going to cut down all these trees?
"OK, Tom, let's shove off."
Tom warned you.
You have a handsome son.
Don't call Tom at his home after 2:30.
What do you think of this book?
He returned home three hours later.
He didn't want to sell the book.
Tomorrow is Christmas Day.
Do you like historical novels?
I wish to go to Hawaii.
Quit acting like a child.
You're not young anymore.
Tom scratched himself.
Be there at noon.
We're counting on you.
Do you think this translation is accurate?
I think this medicine will do you a lot of good.
The furniture was dusty.
Don't bother me with such foolish questions.
It isn't time.
The strike started three days ago.
How do you know?
The snow was very deep.
Tom didn't tell me he was married.
I wish I hadn't parked my car next to Tom's car.
"I didn't ask you, Tom."
I haven't watered the flowers yet.
Tom is a schemer.
Tom taught Mary to swim.
Tom sang for us.
I'd like to live in Europe.
It's on the tip of my tongue.
There are five apples in this box.
Tom said that he was innocent.
Who were you looking for?
"I'd like to buy it, but I can't afford the expense."
I've got a bit of a headache.
"You were hoping to win, weren't you?"
Is Tom living in Boston?
Consult a doctor.
This is the largest.
Hand me that book.
What do you have in your pockets?
"When the war began, Tom was a little kid."
I don't think Tom told Mary anything.
Tom said Mary should go.
The police seized a large quantity of drugs at the school.
"Tom will win, don't you think?"
I know you'll enjoy this movie.
It doesn't matter.
I have to ask you some questions.
He hates cleaning his room.
I had to stay.
Don't translate English into Japanese word for word.
I wish Tom were here.
Why did they arrest Tom?
Did you really see the accident?
I've had a busy day.
I'm happy that you were able to find a job so quickly.
I hope that your brother is better.
I'm living in a small house on Park Street.
Tom was walking slowly with his head down.
Do you know how to make cheesecake?
Why did you kiss Tom?
"If we work together, we should be able to finish this much more quickly."
I can do my job without your help.
I'm trying to save your life.
What time does Tom leave for work?
"I was there, too."
We will keep you informed of things that happen here in Japan.
Did you kill anybody?
We're everywhere.
He doesn't read many newspapers.
Shut the blinds.
You're the only one who understands me.
Yours is worse.
I have many friends in foreign countries.
Maybe there is someone else in the house.
What do you want to know about us?
Go to the garage.
Tom was a bit tipsy.
Tom was one of my better students.
The report has been rewritten.
Are you certain about that?
The doctor didn't allow me to go out.
Factories were producing more than ever before.
Ask Mary out.
Try to stand up.
Tom called Mary and asked her to come over to his house.
I turned thirty last week.
Are you making fun of me?
Tom isn't afraid to get his clothes dirty.
Is this Tom's umbrella?
Don't make fun of people.
I used to play here as a child.
Can you do that in one day?
He can't stop her.
I need a vase to put these flowers in.
I will be more careful.
I want the whole world to know we're going to get married.
Tom wore black pants.
I'll give you a laptop.
I was misinformed.
Now I'm humiliated.
Tom has also left.
We're waiting for the right moment.
I wish I had a twin.
Tom failed his French test.
Tom broke a window in the classroom.
Never forget that you owe what you are to your parents.
I don't know what to sing.
I talked to Tom about this for a long time.
I'm beat. I've been working from dawn to dusk.
Tell us something about yourself.
I didn't want anyone to know why I went there.
I knew Tom was married.
Tom arrived earlier than usual yesterday.
I told Tom I'd help him.
The tower is fifteen metres tall.
Do you think that Tom and I are blind?
Your initial order is subject to a special discount of 5%.
Why are you so late?
Tom bought a new tennis racket.
Tom doesn't hate you.
Tom's house was destroyed by a hurricane.
We'll still be in Australia on Monday.
Tom feels much better now.
Tom will need help.
Will you make coffee for me?
Tom promised he'd help Mary.
Why do you never clean up after yourself?
I thought Tom was a veterinarian.
We can't land the plane on that field.
It's foggy today.
I'm allergic to your dog.
Tom never agrees with Mary.
I don't think I need to do anything else.
Please answer the phone.
I'm 99% sure.
This is a good result.
My house is near the post office.
Tom found out what Mary did.
Aren't you angry at Tom?
Are you hungry?
We had to abandon ship.
Take your time.
What are we eating for dinner?
Congress passed the proposal.
You dozed off.
How was the math test?
Did you know that Tom knew Mary?
We'll find a way to do it.
Tell them not to leave without me.
I probably shouldn't buy anything else today.
She left school two years ago.
I take vitamins every day.
This medicine will ensure you a good night's sleep.
Tom isn't strong enough to open that box.
You and I can work together.
Our fate depends on your decisions.
I still don't understand you.
I'm just not very hungry.
This one is clean.
Tom's face paled.
I'm never going to love you.
He turned a somersault.
Where did this happen?
"I had had my watch repaired, but it broke again."
I appreciate your enthusiasm.
"I would like to learn to play the piano, guitar or flute."
I tried to talk to Tom.
His English is excellent.
There are three survivors.
Have you showered?
Tell Tom where you are.
What's the hold up?
Tom says he has nothing to hide.
The hungry children ate everything on the table.
Hurry up! We are waiting for you.
Tom wants to know your name.
Is it that simple?
Tom gambled away everything he had.
Tom knew all that.
Tom won't wait long.
Memorize it.
Safety is our first priority.
Where's Tom's assistant?
You're going to be late again.
I advised Tom to go home.
We're going to miss you.
Why did Tom want you dead?
Can you play the piano?
Tom had no friends to play with.
She decorated the wall with pictures.
I don't want to talk about the weather.
Why do you treat Tom like that?
He is a self-made man.
What's your favorite mystery novel?
Do you know how much Tom makes?
Does Tom talk to you in French?
It only takes a few minutes.
The whole room became silent.
There are still many things left to learn about the human brain.
"Tom ran to his room, crying."
Tom knows that Mary is the one who did that.
I'm homesick.
It didn't seem to bother Tom at all.
Are you sure it was Tom who did that?
How did you know I had a dog?
Everyone loves you.
You're too young to get married.
I wish someone would help me with English composition.
Wood floats.
"As the iron was heating up, Mary poured distilled water into the reservoir to make steam."
Tom says that he is able to communicate with the dead.
I let Tom down.
Are you going to apologize to Tom?
Get in the boat.
Call me sometime.
Tom made me swear not to say anything.
You know everything.
This coffee is cold.
I hope this is accurate.
Tom put his room in order.
We were in Boston.
You're very unpredictable.
Do you have any idea what you've done?
They accused the teacher of being too strict with the children.
I'm not answering that question.
I don't think Tom is schizophrenic.
She scolded him because he left the door open.
Turtles are reptiles.
I want to meet your parents.
I don't think Tom did that on purpose.
Take command.
Did Tom hit Mary?
How was your flight?
Tom didn't kill his wife.
Be sure to put out the fire before you leave.
Tom and Mary are both very conservative.
Tom wants to become rich and famous.
Tom knew he was in danger.
Tom ate quickly.
"If you were to hear him speak French, you would take him for a Frenchman."
Tom is moving to Boston next week.
Tom overlooked my mistake.
I've got to find out what really happened to Tom.
You should help your father.
I know that Tom has been arrested.
Could you send me more information by email?
Everybody agreed with his idea.
Tom unfolded the letter and read it.
This bowl of soup will be enough.
Did you know that mosquitoes have teeth?
Tell your mother about the trip.
The country is rich in natural resources.
I didn't like doing that.
Tom asked Mary to open all the windows.
Tell me why you're here.
She stood looking out toward the sea.
My father told me I couldn't go abroad alone.
I'd like to shake their hands.
I think you're lazy.
"Don't sing, OK?"
Try it again.
When does it close?
The odor of dirty socks makes me gag.
Mary wants to buy a new dress. What do you want to buy?
Tom has got a large family.
Where did you hide?
Brush your teeth after eating.
Stay with me here.
He did what I told him to do.
I agree with you 100 percent.
"I have something for you, too."
I still don't understand what you want from me.
He has left already.
Are you really not going?
Tom tried to warn Mary what might happen.
"In the 6th century, the Anglo-Saxons adopted Roman characters."
Why is this so familiar?
We ordered 40 minutes ago.
Tom started to behave strangely.
You have every right to be angry at me.
Look what we've done.
Will you open the door?
Tom and I were both asleep.
Listen to your heart.
Can you hear?
I think you know that Tom isn't going to be here today.
Tom wasn't my assistant.
I wonder why Tom went to Boston.
If only I had known this earlier.
The cat is waiting for you at home.
Tom doesn't know where his umbrella is.
We should call Tom.
It's not what I wanted to say.
I'll do anything for you.
What're you doing today?
I can hear a piano.
I asked Tom to do that for me.
The bus hasn't come yet.
You know I won't sing.
Is it true you got married?
Tom put a pillow under Mary's head.
You can change it for another one.
The car hit a telephone pole.
Tom forgot to buy batteries.
I can't smoke.
Tom looked at his watch to see what time it was.
She's pregnant.
We received instructions on how to make a bamboo basket.
You should marry someone you love.
Let in some fresh air.
I don't want to seem insensitive.
I'm going to wait in the car.
Are you sure you don't want us to go with you?
I want you to listen to me very carefully.
Tom didn't go very far.
Tom doesn't know where he is.
I love my mother.
He bought a hat.
Go back to work.
Tom accidentally knocked over the bottle of water.
Did Tom work there?
Are you a typist?
"You told me not to talk to Tom, remember?"
Perhaps we can help Tom.
You guys are pathetic.
Let's stay here.
Tom knew I was going to do that.
I want you to leave me alone.
The climate here is mild.
Tom was old.
My mother died on the same day I got married.
Hand me that wrench.
Are you going to eat all of that yourself?
You caused this.
Which train are you going to take?
Tom ran away from Mary.
I just wanted to warn you.
You promised that Tom would be here.
Have you fed the dog?
Tom isn't my brother. He's my cousin.
I'll be very frank with you.
I think we have all the data we need.
You're smarter than I am.
Tom shouldn't have bought that.
Tom found himself a job.
They went on talking for hours.
I was made to go there.
"Try to be brave, Tom."
Who was punished?
Tom couldn't afford to hire a lawyer.
Tom told me he wasn't afraid of snakes.
We should do that sometime.
Everybody is excited.
Where will the meeting be?
Let's do this properly.
Tom was dangerous.
I saw my name on the list.
I really feel terrible.
I don't know what Tom was reading.
Tom blew out the candles on the cake.
It doesn't happen often.
Who told you I was going to Boston?
The effect was immediate.
What if I'm wrong?
I hate school.
"When the bell rang, the teacher ended the class."
This is very commendable.
I didn't have time to read.
I thought you'd never get here.
Let's get a move on.
Where do you buy your clothes?
This is what I want.
I think you were wrong.
Tom found it difficult to answer the question.
You'll be told where to go.
The plane took off at exactly nine o'clock.
Can I please talk to Tom?
It's not easy being the youngest in the family.
Have you looked everywhere?
I have a date tonight.
This book changed my life.
I didn't mean it.
I need to ask you a few questions.
Tom and Mary have never met.
We will take these matters up one by one.
I could kill you.
Take a wild guess.
He usually comes home late.
I ate nothing but bread and butter.
"In this paper, I compare the folklores of Germany and Holland."
Tom probably already knows that Mary is here.
I'll do as you advise.
I don't want to discuss my problems with you.
I told you it was a waste of time.
Tom had nothing to say.
Tom is a good listener.
Where did Tom get all this information?
Throw Tom the ball.
She was swimming.
I started dating Tom.
"Even if you are busy, you should keep your promise."
Have you taken your medicine yet?
I think it's time for me to go.
Don't give Tom my phone number.
Tom and Mary have just left.
"You're not depressed, are you?"
I don't think Tom understands me.
You should rest now.
Let's talk seriously.
We had a really good talk.
Nobody noticed your absence.
Leave the food on the table.
I want to get this translated into French.
Let's call the police.
"I can play the guitar. Tom can, too."
"I'm sorry, I didn't hear you."
Do you want to go with us?
You've seen enough.
I thought you had found someone else.
Stop telling me to calm down.
I tried to keep a straight face.
I've forgotten where you live.
I wasn't able to answer half the questions.
These shoes don't fit me anymore.
Behave yourself.
I need you tomorrow.
I'm tired of talking to you about this.
This painting is attributed to Monet.
Shall we go together?
I'm waiting for a call.
Tom put on his pajamas and climbed into bed.
I wonder if Tom likes Mary.
I don't really want to go swimming today.
Tom walked over to Mary and introduced himself.
You could talk to Tom.
Thank you so much for this information.
I saw nothing at all.
I have nothing to offer.
Don't rush things.
Why did you lend so much money to Tom?
We sat together in silence for some time.
I just knew you would say that.
You're not fired.
The police released him.
Does anybody know you're here?
This door won't budge.
She wore a simple dress.
Empty your pockets.
I need you to understand what really happened to Tom.
Do you want to talk to someone?
I'd like to come over after work.
This is what I need.
Did I miss the turn?
You cannot be serious.
What does your aunt do?
The power rests with Tom.
The box was open and empty.
What were you doing last night?
We're going.
I hope Tom feels better today.
Read it aloud.
I wish we had won the game.
I held my breath.
He thinks of everything in terms of money.
Tom is a talented actor.
It helped me a lot.
I was thirsty.
Is there something you need?
Tom almost lost his eye.
I could kill you.
Why is Tom even here?
We have to solve the problem.
Can you distinguish silver from tin?
How much will it cost to fix the car?
That doesn't mean Tom will stop doing that.
Tom and Mary arrived in Boston before dark.
Tom hasn't yet been told to do that.
Do you enjoy cooking?
Tom was Mary's first love.
My daughter's name is Mary.
How could that have happened?
I know you trust Tom.
It's time to stop.
I pressed the button to turn the radio on.
Tell Tom that he needs to wear a tie tomorrow.
You're thirty minutes late.
Tom needs to see you.
Tom begged me to help him.
I can't believe you're still single.
Just follow me.
They work in the fields.
Why are you with me?
Everything is so strange.
Doing that can be extremely dangerous.
I've been to Australia a couple of times.
Tom is hyperactive.
It was nothing.
It's getting bigger.
I wish you weren't already married.
The suspect is armed and dangerous.
I've already told you that I'm not the one who did that.
I'm trying to stop Tom.
I'm very glad to see you again.
I'm paid to do this.
He likes singing and dancing.
Should we change the flag?
Put it on the shelf.
I find that pretty interesting.
Mary is a very elegant woman.
I didn't sleep all night.
You don't want to lose that.
She concealed the fact that she used to be a salesgirl.
She was crying with pain.
Why do you think that's a good idea?
I don't want you to do this.
There's someone hiding in the closet.
You'll tell me everything eventually.
She is living an unhappy life.
No one knew that Tom wasn't a Canadian.
Don't tell Tom anything.
I don't think that I need to do anything else.
We're leaving about noon.
I did it in a couple of days.
Is there someone here who speaks French?
I asked Tom if he was OK.
I think no one believed Tom.
It had to happen sooner or later.
She married him even though she didn't like him.
Tom was able to solve the problem.
I'll let you know beforehand.
Tom and Mary were both crying.
Tom's car isn't in the garage.
I don't like you either.
Turn left at the first light.
Are they going to fight?
I'll go with you.
I thought you were going to buy that car.
It was a tough test.
Tom has a son also named Tom.
Tom dreamed about zebras.
Tom will never be able to do that without our help.
Tom knew that that was a bad idea.
Mosquitoes are insects.
How could you not notice?
Everyone has been looking for you.
I don't know anything about the situation.
I need that information as soon as possible.
That's a waste of my talents.
I relaxed.
I'm so happy you're here!
Tom said that Mary was crazy.
Which one is better?
Tom never talked to me.
Tell them to introduce themselves.
I'm cooperative.
Tom can't go with us.
I climbed the tree.
Predicting the future is impossible.
Did you really expect me to do that?
I will find out how the medicine works.
Do your homework.
The supermarket opens at ten o'clock.
You were the last person to see Tom.
I would like to see it.
You're out of touch with reality.
We need to eat now.
We only have three spoons.
Tom gave an apple to the teacher.
How much can you pay?
I don't know your name.
Tom wants me to leave.
Her daughter is sick.
I'll go to Boston next summer to visit Tom.
I grow orchids in my greenhouse.
Tom was my daughter's best friend.
I want to apologize for everything I said.
I'm looking for a job that pays well.
I've never swum in a pool.
Tom is very busy with his work.
Where did Tom learn how to play the guitar like that?
That's what the doctor ordered.
The girl looked around.
Are you sure it belongs to Tom?
I know none of them.
Swimming is prohibited here.
Let's not go.
You need to apologize to Tom.
I thought you'd understand.
That goes without saying.
Tom and Mary are the same age.
"They're very, very good."
Tom quietly left the room.
You're too young to do that.
Am I alone here?
I didn't speak with Tom directly.
What exactly are your symptoms?
Tom was moody.
I think that Tom could've done that.
Tom finished third.
He traveled around the country.
Keep the money.
I'm still too weak to get out of bed.
Don't order anything for me.
Tom didn't have enough money to pay the bill.
Are you a real nurse?
I had a bad summer.
There was a lot of food on the table.
Everything is burning.
Tom wouldn't have lied.
This really helped.
Have you ever played tennis with Tom?
I wanted to do more.
I was distracted.
The accused was found not guilty.
What do you think happened to the money?
Ask only questions that can be answered with yes or no.
Now what do I have to do?
We're tired of this.
When will this end?
"By helping you, we're helping ourselves."
I'm a loser.
Put the words in alphabetical order.
I am sorry to have kept you waiting so long.
Today's housewives do nothing but complain of high prices.
It is time for you to go to bed.
I had to go myself.
Did you make a serious attempt to find Tom?
I should be the one taking care of Tom.
Is there no other way?
Tom said that he felt cold.
I didn't even notice that.
"Fortunately, no one was hurt."
Where exactly are you?
I know I can win.
Do you need it now?
Tom asked me to tell you that.
I thought you didn't care about money.
Tom and I were here yesterday.
We can't avoid postponing our departure.
Tom begged Mary to stay.
Have you ever seen Tom naked?
I hope you won't tell anyone you saw me leave this house.
Tom works very hard.
Don't try to manipulate me.
I don't intend to do so.
We can't work without electricity.
I am going to buy a new car.
We didn't have any choice.
Everyone needs money.
Tom knows how to win.
Tom was trembling with fear.
I'm probably the one who'll do that.
Tom sprang to his feet.
I didn't eat everything that she served me.
Tom says he wants a puppy for Christmas.
The police detective didn't believe Tom's story.
Tom is at school.
This car's tires don't have enough air.
I don't think that's enough.
Tom told me you didn't eat pork.
Don't you want to try?
I'm listening to a song that Tom recorded.
Did you know that rotten eggs float?
I think I have a broken rib.
Please close the curtains.
Tom tried to do that once.
The next song I'm going to sing is one I wrote last summer.
"Do you have something to add, Tom?"
She can speak three languages.
I tried to talk to Tom in French.
I wanted to apologize to Tom.
I don't think that they're teachers.
I'm not the problem.
I simply don't understand this.
It is up to you.
I had a cat.
This mission is highly secret and extremely dangerous.
It was unusual.
You've never seen a genuine diamond.
"If you don't mind, I'd like to talk to Tom alone."
You've gained weight.
He's my partner.
I knew Tom wasn't going to wait.
How many are there in all?
I suspect you know why I'm here.
We'll do it tomorrow if you want to.
Release Tom.
What did you find there?
I know you'll do that.
I woke up.
Wait a second here.
Tom is only interested in soccer.
That rings a bell.
Tom and Mary have a lot in common.
How could you do that?
You should let us help you.
I'm not sure whether Tom has ever been to Boston or not.
Tom is too young to vote.
I don't want to live with you anymore.
It became clear that she had told a lie.
I can't help you because I'm busy.
I forgot to buy a present for Tom.
Tom's not ready for that.
How much does beer cost?
I didn't object.
How's that even possible?
Am I the only one who thinks this is strange?
Is Tom still there?
Where did you go fishing?
I don't believe you're right.
I thought maybe you were right.
I wanted Tom to help me solve the problem.
I got back at 2:30.
My mom thinks I'm smart.
They spent the entire day on the beach.
How can I become rich?
I'm going to do a trick with only four cards.
Tom looks like a girl.
Everybody was wearing gloves.
This is all I can do for you.
Tom gets along very well with Mary.
Tom could tell by the look on Mary's face that she was very excited.
Do you have any daughters?
I thought she was sick.
Was that a lie?
Tom threatened us.
Tom has gone fishing.
Tom hardly ever watches TV.
You've haven't paid me yet.
I want you to know that I'll always love you.
I'm not sure that that's possible.
You can always ask us for help.
I called my son.
Who was on the phone?
Tom wanted to come with us.
He died of cancer last year.
Tom and Mary aren't in Australia now.
I didn't tell Tom to come.
How much do you need?
It's very valuable.
Tom ran out of gas on his way home from work.
"In order to do this, I need help."
Tom doesn't like to talk about his problems.
Do you want us to take you back to your house?
You're still growing.
Do your parents know that you're here?
More and more Americans go abroad.
The audience burst out laughing.
You could've told me earlier.
How many times do I have to say it?
Tom should've told Mary he was married.
I really hope that you voted for Tom.
You aren't one of us.
I ruined everything.
There are millions of stars in the universe.
I didn't want to go.
We're not going to let Tom win.
Was Tom on your team?
We're both named Tom.
Am I first?
Tom has got to get to a hospital.
Do you want half of this cake?
My gas bill for last month was very high.
He is handsome and clever.
I suggest you try harder.
Tom wanted to destroy it.
The police were inquiring into the suspect's past.
You knew I wouldn't do that.
The construction of the hospital is about to end.
That's no exaggeration.
He wants to participate in the contest.
I can't stand the smell.
Tom should've called me.
I expect you to be punctual.
You're younger than me.
Tom has admitted it.
Did that really happen to him?
"I'm glad you came, too."
Are you sure it's safe?
I like seafood.
"I'm not as old as you, of course."
Tom's not home.
My best friend stole my boyfriend.
Where did I put my reading glasses?
Mary is afraid of men.
Tom was very impressed.
I captured butterflies with a net.
I didn't betray you.
Can I ask something?
I've got a class in a few minutes.
Tom is still outside.
Tom didn't intend to hurt you.
They should treat people with more respect.
Tom said he wanted to go home.
Tom doesn't know what this is. Do you?
Leave me some ice cream.
I usually dream in French unless I'm dreaming about talking to one of my English-speaking friends.
Tom has no siblings.
I work on Sunday.
I always believe you.
I think you resemble your mother.
That is almost correct.
I don't think that Tom knows why you didn't do that.
It rains a lot in June.
There's a garden behind our house.
Zoos are like prisons for animals.
Tom had to do a lot of apologizing.
I doubt that Tom will forget that.
Tom never lost hope.
I attended Tom's funeral.
Tom doubts what happened today will ever happen again.
How much longer will you be here?
I don't think that Tom knows Mary is here.
Are you going to the shop? Will you buy me a toy?
Tom isn't able to drive a car.
Who will you give the first piece of cake to?
I know Tom is a pharmacist.
I can't breathe through my nose.
This isn't yours.
Probably you are allergic to pollen or dust.
"Sorry, I can't stay for long."
I'm saving up so that I can go to Australia.
Tom and Mary skated on the frozen pond.
You had better go.
Tom didn't want to admit he was scared.
He weighs 70 kilos.
I thought that Tom didn't have a car.
She's about the same age as my sister.
I don't think that Tom can find the time to do that.
"Oh, the electricity has gone off."
"Tom was kidnapped on October 20, 2013, while he was waiting for a bus."
How are you going to prove that we did that?
It's just going to take time.
I thought that Tom would never show up.
They insulted him and his wife.
Tom is taking a bath in my bathtub.
The pool is full of clean water.
Tom looked like he was sick.
I'd be happy if you'd help me.
I hate it when people do that.
Tom can't afford anything.
"Have a nice day, Tom."
She taught me how to write a poem.
Tom drove off in a hurry.
Stop wasting your breath.
Don't touch it.
Why did you hire me?
May I turn on the TV?
Do you want to go back to Boston?
I can watch TV all day without getting bored.
I need to exercise more.
Did you have a nice dinner with Tom?
I should've done it by myself.
I had a little help.
Tom can do whatever he wants.
You need to disappear before they find you.
You sound like a lawyer.
I've already told Tom what I have to do.
You were lucky to find it.
Didn't you know Tom had relatives in Australia?
Tom's fainted.
It's so silly.
See you on the train.
I'll leave it up to you.
Tom wouldn't let me talk with you.
He is of average height.
Your cooking is delicious.
I remember this poem.
He came home late last night.
How many people came to the zoo yesterday?
Tom never even noticed Mary.
I'd like to have you on our team.
Tom thinks Mary will be busy all day.
Does anyone else have any advice?
We have to leave a bit earlier.
Tom thanked us all.
She was accepted by Harvard.
I sometimes watch documentaries.
I asked Tom.
Tom was about to do that.
She showed me her album.
Ask Tom about it.
"After all, it's reasonable."
Fasten your seatbelts.
It will work.
Tom doesn't think so.
Tom might not know the answer.
Did he say anything about it?
Why don't you just sell it?
This is your key.
Where would you like to live?
Tom and I were married to each other for three years.
Tom has been accused of stealing.
What are your office hours?
I am almost 40 years old and I am still single.
Who gave it to you?
Tom fell asleep with his clothes on.
I knew I couldn't trust you.
I hope you enjoyed your trip.
He made up his mind to try again.
I haven't asked a question yet.
Let's do this as quickly as possible.
There used to be a church here.
I think Tom was sick.
I can't speak to Tom.
Is there anyone who can speak Chinese here?
I bought a sandwich.
I'm not old enough to do that.
The salt ran out.
This hairstyle was popular in the nineties.
I worked a lot today.
Tom passed away three years ago.
This doesn't look good.
Tom told me he wanted to leave.
How dare you accuse me of that!
We would rather go to the zoo than to the park.
I left my keys on the table.
Tom rang the bell.
Can you reach what's on the top shelf?
I'm going to introduce you to my mother-in-law.
Who will you vote for?
I don't need anything else.
The policeman captured the man who was running.
Tom is a child.
Exhale through your mouth.
Be careful. It's very spicy.
"He's a man of his word, so you can count on him."
That's the reason I don't like Tom.
You need to go on a diet.
Tom wasn't afraid of me.
He is due to arrive tomorrow.
He's the black sheep of the family.
Don't forget to mail this letter first thing in the morning.
Did you inform your teacher of this?
Tom didn't tell Mary where he lived.
There's no time for explanations.
Tom said no one was arrested.
"If I'd known what you were going to do, I'd've tried to stop you."
Don't forget what I just told you.
Who ate the bread?
Everybody wanted to know why Tom quit his job.
Tom said he didn't plan to do that.
Who's coming for dinner?
Tom's daughter's boyfriend is Canadian.
I knew Tom wouldn't be surprised.
Tom died three years ago.
It's going to break.
You're credible.
That won't help.
I lied about that.
Let's make a snowman.
Tom has very white teeth.
We're only halfway through.
I want to make sure you know what to do.
I need to get them back.
Do you like robots?
Tom usually gets up early.
Let me introduce you to my parents.
I didn't expect you to come today.
Tom thanked Mary for her advice.
Are your parents with you?
It's hot in here.
Don't worry. You'll make it.
I almost didn't see you.
I don't know who to trust anymore.
January is the first month of the year.
We don't want your money.
Let's play chess another time.
Your death will not have been in vain.
I'm not sure you're ready.
I told Tom to leave you alone.
We were expecting it.
I know Tom has to leave tomorrow.
I heard about your problems from Tom.
Tom wasn't scared.
I want to live.
"Men make houses, women make homes."
Tell me about your new girlfriend.
I may never walk again.
Take that box away!
I was told you wanted to see me.
You know what I like.
People are gathering.
Some words are hard to define.
Tom helped because he wanted to.
Tom is more experienced in business than I am.
The gate was open.
"It is windy today, isn't it?"
I'll do my best to be there by 2:30.
Tom eats like a pig.
I had a strange dream.
My friend helped me.
"I tried to eat it, but I couldn't."
Tom needs your help right away.
They don't like cats.
He may have missed the train.
You guys can't leave yet.
Come on over here.
I think Tom is unmarried.
I can't put up with this cold.
I'm not fat.
That's why we have to stay.
I've lived in Boston for many years.
What's the best sleeping position?
I just don't want to talk to you.
I'm glad to meet you.
I'm sure you'll have a good time.
A teacher's salary is less than an attorney's.
They are my cousins.
You need a key.
Your students don't like me.
Won't you meet me halfway?
Do you think you and Tom will get back together?
He must be stupid to believe such a thing.
What do you do for a living?
Tom was injured in the fall.
I don't want to live on this planet anymore.
Tom is from Australia and so is Mary.
The day after tomorrow is Tom's birthday.
I got married.
You'll never guess what we saw.
Tom isn't here. He went home.
The answer is 42.
Tom is an outlaw.
Tom will be here any minute.
Tom is all dressed up.
I believe that won't happen.
When did you find this?
What is it you have against Tom?
I'm really tired today.
I don't know who you're talking about.
Let's all pitch in and get the work done.
"I just know his name, that's all."
Do you think it's necessary to do that?
I've already visited Boston several times.
Don't you miss your father?
This picture is wonderful.
Do you want to buy this?
Tom is still full of energy.
Tom drives a white car.
I'm happy when I'm with you.
Tom asked Mary to meet John at the station.
Tom said he wasn't tired.
I hate them all.
Tom and Mary got married just three months after they first met each other.
Tom is pruning the trees.
Leave a comment.
The sun has gone down.
Do your parents smoke?
I work hard.
"If you do that, I'll do that, too."
Don't worry about the cost.
I thought you said that you didn't want to do that.
It's Tom's first day at school.
Your daughter is tall.
Tom and Mary don't need to know that.
I've worked out a good plan.
Tom has a baseball card collection.
Who knows Tom is here?
The doctor took his pulse.
"Which are heavier, sandwiches or onigiris?"
What would've happened if Tom hadn't done that?
I'm coming with you.
Please have some cookies.
I've already apologized for doing that.
I've decided to do that myself.
Tom and Mary looked equally confused.
Tom and Mary don't know that.
I guess I was too busy to notice that Tom was having problems.
He studied hard and passed the test.
Tom said that he would come to the party.
Can you sing this song?
We're glad to see you.
Do you think Tom is really there?
You can rely on Tom.
We hope many of you will come.
I'd never suggest that.
I want you to wear this one.
I know that this is weird.
"You're not a teacher, are you?"
Tom isn't so bad.
I promise I'll wait for you.
I received your message.
I won't eat breakfast today.
Tom sang better than Mary did.
Bring me a bucket of water.
Do you feel safe in Australia?
"At first, I didn't know my leg was broken."
I've got to get back home by midnight.
Tom is the only one who knows why Mary doesn't want to go with us.
Cuzco is one of the most interesting places in the world.
Tom can show you.
Tom held the knife like this.
"On arriving home, I discovered the burglary."
I know that Tom is wrong.
It's all right for now.
Tom has a white cat.
Tom attends church regularly.
He offered more than could be expected.
I said some things I didn't mean.
You or I will be chosen.
Tom went fishing almost every day last summer.
I needed it yesterday.
I play the trumpet.
Tell her that I am taking a bath.
Will you look after our pets while we're away?
I've tried everything already.
I hope you slept well.
Do you take work home with you?
I don't feel like eating right now.
When will your train arrive in Boston?
Tell Tom to quit crying.
You'll be able to see Tom tomorrow.
Thanks in advance for your help.
Do you have guests for dinner?
She's very religious.
So what really happened?
I shoved my hands into my pockets.
Tom is still too young to get a driver's license.
Tom is the lead engineer.
They make a perfect couple.
You're fair.
We're not going to buy anything today.
Where did you get this information?
Tom will never win.
We have a very serious problem here.
Tom is likely not to do that.
I couldn't wait to talk to Tom.
I think that Tom is trying to trick us.
The king's son was kidnapped.
I wasn't present at the meeting.
That's what we're here for.
It's only the beginning.
Do you realize what's happening?
A lot of people do that.
What kind of movies do you like to watch?
Tom asked me what he could do for me.
Tom asked Mary what she wanted for her birthday.
We have waited for you the whole day.
I like that necklace.
She didn't say a word.
The bus was empty.
You were the one who gave this to me.
Wait here for me.
I put on my trousers.
Tom is in the other room getting dressed.
I think you're too picky.
The table was covered with dust.
It's even worse than it looks.
You're probably hungry.
That was all I could afford.
She lost a book.
"Suddenly, it started to rain."
Tom forgot to remind Mary about the meeting.
"Yes, we can go."
Tom will go with you.
It happened right in front of us.
Where do we start?
Will anybody else be there?
I got what you asked for.
I've never shot anyone.
Tom doesn't live far from where he works.
Tom and Mary are busy people.
The young man is quite suited for the position.
Did you hear what they were saying?
Tom will take you home.
I'm now used to not smoking.
Perhaps Tom doesn't speak French.
I don't want to be rich. I just don't want to be poor.
He cannot afford to buy a car.
I think you did an excellent job.
I am forbidden to use this telephone.
I don't want you hanging out with Tom.
It is quite a hard thing to bring up a child.
I love Italian food.
"My wife will be glad to see you, too."
I was eating dinner then.
I cannot describe my feelings.
I am going to America by plane.
I told Tom that I'd help you.
Tom took out his wallet to pay the bill.
You can't be sure of that.
He has been sitting there for two hours.
Did Tom see what happened?
Tom is just shy.
Tom was too afraid to enter the cave.
It's all in your imagination.
You're reading my mind.
Tom and Mary won't be able to do that without your help.
Don't you pay attention?
AI stands for artificial intelligence.
Put that away.
Tom didn't know that Mary was John's mother.
Tom locked himself in his room and cried.
You should take the number 5 bus.
We need a positive result.
Tom and Mary danced together.
I did that one time.
I can hear you.
Now we can all relax.
Tom's a great actor.
Tom placed flowers on Mary's grave.
Will you go to Boston next year?
I'm glad Tom enjoyed it.
We are the champions.
The magazine comes out every week.
I want to know why this happened.
They're using you.
I told you Tom would be back.
He seems to have been ill for a long time.
Don't hurt Tom.
You might as well wait until Tuesday.
I never thought I'd see Tom again.
Tom is a lighthouse keeper and leads a lonely life.
I won't have to do that myself.
Which one did you buy?
Almost everything went wrong.
We won't be able to survive without your help.
You'll find this book very interesting.
That's all Tom has to say.
No one respects me.
Tom works too much.
Tell me the good news first.
People who talk about themselves all the time bore me.
Friends are very important.
How much weight do you want to lose?
Tom's actions aren't predictable.
Please be serious.
Are you busy tomorrow afternoon?
I like these shoes better than those.
We didn't talk yesterday.
Have you ever done any volunteer work?
I regret saying that you were wrong.
Tom filled his thermos with coffee.
I believe Tom knows.
You could have drowned.
Aren't you in a hurry?
Just sign here.
Do you remember what Tom was wearing?
I think we're going to regret this.
Tom won't be arrested.
I was in bed with the flu.
Your birthday's coming up.
I heard that Tom lost his job.
I have to go to the toilet.
Were you alone?
It'll be hard to do that.
Tom told me you were retired.
Throw them away.
It was a rainy evening.
I'm stronger than you.
Didn't you know Tom was planning to go to Boston with Mary?
Don't lie to us.
I've decided not to do this anymore.
My father recently quit smoking.
What do you have in mind?
Don't let him touch it.
Can you watch the kids?
I'll consider your suggestion.
We're so happy you're here.
Madrid is one of the most beautiful capitals in Europe.
Where does the airport bus leave from?
Why didn't you come?
Tom is mad about you.
Tom thinks I'm romantic.
Get out of the water.
I suppose he will be late.
I think you should go there.
You could've warned me.
I believe that that's correct.
You can borrow my pen.
I knew that Tom wouldn't be able to win.
I normally don't drink coffee.
This question is difficult to answer.
"Tom got into his car, started the engine, and drove away."
Tom has worked as a journalist.
I am spinning wool.
They had weapons.
"Tom is very popular, isn't he?"
I can't believe that Tom is gone.
I didn't believe them.
He must buy a new bicycle for his son.
Tom asked Mary how many languages she could speak.
It's red.
Please give me that.
Are you proud of your father?
Why are you so sure of his success?
I'll do what you ask.
That's why I trust you.
They set aside her objections.
We were surprised by Tom's decision.
Maybe you're in love.
Did you come by train?
Tom knows you're a Canadian.
Tom was scolded by his mother.
The mission was simple.
Where will we go?
Tom understands what it takes to succeed.
Tom is looking at Mary.
We've spent too much money.
I already know where you live.
Tom says he's been thinking about what Mary said.
We deserve better than that.
I didn't know that you were waiting.
You are my prisoner.
We brought it with us.
My watch gains one minute a day.
Tom doesn't like girls who wear high heels.
I think Tom won't cry.
Tom thought that you were in Australia.
Why were you holding his hand?
Tom will win sooner or later.
I don't recall asking you to do that.
I told Tom that I wouldn't do that.
Is this really your car?
You'll never guess why I'm here.
Tom motioned Mary to stay.
Do you want to hear my story or not?
Are you brushing your teeth properly?
Every monster starts off as someone's baby.
The police are looking for you.
Can I trust Tom?
Tom said he wants to sell his house.
Tom put a new roll of film into his camera.
I've disobeyed Tom.
They know your name.
Tom is kind.
It doesn't look like anything.
Tom stopped reading.
Didn't you know Tom would win?
"Get in the van, everybody."
Tom's French isn't very good.
Stay away from that guy.
I just remembered something.
I think you need to call Tom.
That really was a tough break.
Tom didn't respond right away.
"Excuse me, have you seen Tom?"
Tom got into his car and quickly drove off.
Tom has a sister who is a lawyer.
I sat down and opened my laptop.
I should probably spend more time with Tom.
"If you don't know, find out."
Tom has lost his wallet.
Tom will do that on Monday.
Did Tom tell you what his plans are?
They aren't here yet.
I was waiting for you.
Tom will be able to answer your question.
What would you say if you were in my place?
Tom wanted to meet Mary.
We're very happy for you.
I've been evicted.
Beware of the dog!
I'm used to this cold weather.
What's the weather like in Australia?
Tom didn't go and I didn't either.
I thought Tom was rich.
I'll take this back.
May I suggest another strategy?
Can you start a fire?
The play will be repeated next week.
Are you scared?
No one's going to help you.
Tom lost his job three months ago.
She knew better than to tell him such a story.
Tom is a good partner.
Someone had to stop you.
Tom let me down.
What did Tom just do?
Do you read French every day?
I don't understand art.
That's a great story.
I know that you will forgive me.
Tom is trying to make sure that everything is ready.
Are we talking about the same Tom?
That's no longer true.
It isn't the first time and it won't be the last.
Tom lied to me.
Do you know whose this is?
He must be crazy to go out in this stormy weather.
I clean my room more often than Tom cleans his.
Tom will remember this weekend as long as he lives.
I can't afford to buy both.
My car was stolen.
Tom almost went to Boston instead of Chicago.
You said nothing.
She avoids me.
You're not thirty.
I have a friend in Boston.
I don't want to stay any longer.
Do I need to sign something?
"Tom couldn't eat anything, but he drank a little water."
"The last time I saw Tom, he was on a stretcher."
Do you want to come back home?
Have you decided where you're going to celebrate your birthday?
Everyone wants something.
I've ordered you a hamburger.
Tom will find them.
Do you know anybody who lives in Australia?
There's a lot of trash on the far bank of the river.
Tom went there yesterday.
You came home at 5:00.
Tom is going to resign.
I just finished cleaning the attic.
Tom told me a joke.
Do we have any chance of winning?
How do I turn this off?
It's not that hard.
Take this medicine and you'll feel better soon.
She picked out three beautiful apples.
Tom spilled coffee all over my shirt.
Tom arrived after I left.
I want you to see this.
This is Tom.
The dogs barked all night.
That doesn't sound quite right.
What should I name it?
Don't let Tom watch TV.
A portrait was hung on the wall.
Let me show you something.
She said that the mere sight of him made her sick.
We must tell him about it.
Tom needs your help.
I lost my key.
Tom asked Mary whether she'd like to go shopping in the afternoon.
They armed the people.
Give us a moment.
Who do you think we are?
The question is what for.
How did you hit on that?
Do you need the key?
Tom watched Mary carefully.
Tom went back inside.
I want to go to sleep.
Do you know Latin?
We're shy.
I had no trouble falling asleep.
I think that Tom will be able to do that if he tries.
Some people believe they can rewrite history.
Mom has a fever.
Am I going to be OK?
Tom needs to move out of his parents' house.
I lost my ticket. What should I do?
Tom said Mary was unhappy.
His mother is taking care of him.
You probably think she told me she was on her way to visit her sick grandmother.
I can't tell yet.
Do you want to speak to Tom?
The soul is immortal.
Tom prays several times a day.
Just tell me you're OK.
I'm very comfortable.
It looks like those two have made up.
I have to at least try.
Tom's spaceship has artificial gravity.
Where did you spend your summer vacation?
You did a good job today.
I wonder if Tom would really do something like that.
I speak French to my father and English to my mother.
I didn't want to say anything.
Do you have any alternatives to the plan?
You are not our friend.
I don't want Tom to go to Australia without me.
It looks like Tom is out.
I'll do it in the morning.
These wild flowers give off a nice smell.
Thanks for the info.
I'm getting used to doing that.
It's your fault that that happened.
Tom eventually divorced Mary.

The two towns are separated by a river.
We had to wait for him for ten minutes.
You'll soon find out.
It's late.
"If anyone can do it, it's you."
I want you to stay here.
"Your name's Tom, isn't it?"
Let's decorate the Christmas tree.
I wonder if I should answer his letter.
I decided not to go to Europe.
Tom wasn't asleep.
He got a nice job recently.
I carried the box on my shoulder.
Tom said that nobody was arrested.
So what is the plan?
I won't close the door.
"You were scared, weren't you?"
Tom is better at French than English.
Tom asked everybody to leave him alone.
Enjoy yourself.
Tom agrees with you.
Tom died at 2:30.
I think you need my help.
Tom didn't believe it for a second.
Tom hasn't done that a lot.
The old man looked wise.
I'm a US citizen.
Tom wants me to go with him.
Tom asked me about how school was going.
I don't mind telling you what I know.
It's unusual.
I knew you'd wait.
Tom is not a bad person.
There was no response to my question.
I'm very grateful for your help.
I don't think that was your fault.
I've already said too much as it is.
What did Tom do this time?
I think you know that that isn't true.
Tom was 30 years old.
Tom knew Mary was sick.
Tom's cooking was actually not so bad.
There are no secrets between us.
I'm bipolar.
I shot the horse.
I missed the last bus and had to walk home in the rain.
Words cannot describe it.
I like your city.
Can I talk to you a sec?
Penguins often huddle together to keep warm.
Are you still alone?
My vacation went by quickly.
I shouldn't have written that.
We've done the impossible.
This is going to be difficult.
I want Tom kept away from here.
Tom carried two boxes into the storage room.
Give Tom some time.
Tom told me not to go there by myself.
Do you like white chocolate?
I'm coming with you.
Tom craves attention.
I saw Tom off at the airport.
Tom said that he would've come if he'd been invited.
I didn't want to push my luck.
What must you do?
Tom won't ever do that again.
Thank you for telling me.
My boss let me leave early today.
The sky is clear.
There isn't any need for you to rush.
You must clean your room.
I knew you'd enjoy that movie.
There was a steady increase in population.
Tom has more money than I'll ever earn in my entire life.
Yours was better than mine.
He was not able to marry her.
Does Tom know where you live?
He isn't here yet.
Come back home.
Why don't you go to bed?
I really didn't understand.
I hope your dreams come true.
Who is their homeroom teacher?
We enjoy reading books.
Tom is alone in the house.
You didn't even try.
I want my phone back.
The house belongs to him.
What's your French teacher's name?
Please open the bottle.
We're careful.
Tom was a little tipsy.
Tom grew roses.
We'll change it.
Tom got a job at a local pizzeria.
I thought you said it was yours.
I have a package for Tom.
Please write down your home address.
Tom isn't having any fun.
Did Tom say how he was planning to get to Boston?
I don't want you to lose.
I ate dinner at a restaurant on Park Street.
I'm often mistaken for my brother.
It was a bad idea.
Tom told me he wanted to leave the company.
Where do we start?
"The bigger a city grows, the dirtier the air and water become."
I need to know what you saw that night.
It seems like just yesterday that you were here.
I don't like sad movies.
Tom is usually free on Monday.
Tom lives somewhere in Australia.
Tom asked me to help him paint his house.
I have to know.
I've felt better.
We discussed our plans for a trip to Italy over coffee.
Why are we leaving?
Have you decided on a name for your new baby?
Tom doesn't want to ask Mary to do that.
Tom lives in his own world.
I have seen a UFO before.
I wonder who the next president of the United States will be.
"If you don't want to do this, you don't have to."
"For once in your life, do what I ask."
I got it for my birthday.
Tom is a hippie.
The hunter followed the bear's tracks.
Throw the dice.
That's not the same thing.
It's all over between us.
All I know is that he came from China.
Tom said that Mary was thirty.
Tom and Mary have always gotten along well with each other.
The loss amounted to 100 dollars.
Take my word for it.
Picasso's paintings seem strange to me.
You picked a bad time.
We need to get Tom to change his mind.
Tom told Mary he'd study French.
What color reflects light the best?
I wish I could turn back time.
Tom has helped me a lot.
Tom gave me Mary's phone number.
What would you like to do?
Mary didn't kill her husband.
Tom works slowly.
I'd like to rent a car.
Tom will likely be frightened.
Tom was extremely intelligent.
He went from Tokyo to Osaka by plane.
We both teach French.
Tom got very drunk.
Many museums are closed on Mondays.
Let's kiss.
He is married with two children.
I cooked dinner.
Where did I park my car?
It's not necessary.
Did you know that's from Boston?
We'll have to have a little discussion regarding that last point.
I usually wear jeans on Sunday.
I knew Tom lied to us.
We can't interfere.
Do I really have to eat this?
You should apologize.
She always smiles.
This is completely unacceptable.
"Hey, your dog just bit me."
Tom isn't afraid of anyone.
Tom was wearing a mask.
Tom isn't as nice as Mary.
I could have saved Tom's life.
"Tom grows tomatoes, cucumbers and lettuce."
Tom said he didn't want me to sing.
Tom is a murderer.
The old man lives alone.
How did you get here?
I opened the window.
Do you have a snowboard?
I had him repair my watch.
He took the wrong train by mistake.
Tom had to be hospitalized.
He can't be an honest man.
Man cannot live forever.
I used to be like Tom.
"You forgot his name, didn't you?"
I have no wish to live in a large city.
They won't mind.
I'm afraid that we have no choice.
I don't know who to give this package to.
Is it true that you breast-fed all your children?
The house was destroyed by fire.
Thanks for helping.
Tom told me he was married.
I was invited to lunch.
I was just trying to protect you.
All you have to do is sit here and watch.
I can't promise anything.
I didn't know that Tom had gotten fired.
Why would I worry?
Don't tell Tom why.
Please eat some cake.
Even children know that.
Did you come by train?
I think you're prepared.
I'm not a very good singer.
You're such a coward.
He hid it behind the door.
Is this what you were looking for?
I love you more and more every day.
Anyone can make a mistake.
It looks like a cactus.
Who was that woman?
Why don't you have any clothes on?
Let Tom go.
Did you really have to do that?
I want to visit Boston someday.
Don't you understand why?
Tom is a patriot.
Tom is the type of person who always demands that something be done rather than request that it be done.
I put it in your room.
Tom couldn't say anything else.
That just goes to prove that you are a liar.
I know that Tom is more handsome than I am.
We sometimes meet them.
I didn't want you to know.
I succeeded.
I'm only telling you what I heard.
The mosque was torched in the middle of the night.
I didn't know why Tom was absent.
Things were never the same after that.
"We must trust each other, Tom."
I had a dog when I was a kid.
I ate all the cookies that were on the plate.
I was upstairs.
Why isn't there any wine left in the bottle? Did you kids drink it?
It hurts here.
I can't leave that document here with you.
There is no clock in my room.
That's Tom's voice.
The relationship between the two countries has waxed and waned over the years.
There's only one bottle of red wine left.
My favorite color of lipstick is pink.
I'll pay you tomorrow.
I'll ask Tom for permission.
I know it myself.
Americans were shocked and afraid.
Tom didn't study for his final exam.
The problem is we don't have enough money.
Tom lives in Australia with his mother.
I'm not all that smart.
Spread the sand evenly.
He always pays attention to his children's behavior.
Are you sure Tom is OK?
The show will begin soon.
Tom has been in this situation before.
Hospitals are very expensive.
I don't think anybody can do that.
She did nothing but cry all the while.
That's an interesting story.
Do you know how to swear in French?
The whole city is covered with snow.
I asked Tom how long he'd lived in Boston.
I don't think that Tom knows what Mary wants to buy.
You should dress warmly.
Did I hear you right?
I won't tell anybody that you did that.
I said stop.
I spent the summer in Boston.
There is nothing to hinder me.
I really like working with people.
The cause of death seems to be a gunshot wound.
I prayed.
What happened here?
Were you in Boston last year?
What is your favorite sport?
I switched my computer on.
You should've kept that a secret.
Tom had to stay in bed.
Keep the engine running. I'll be right back.
The will was declared void by the court.
Tom is biased.
"Tom is at school, isn't he?"
Tom decided to give Mary a second chance.
The sea was very smooth.
I enjoy swimming.
"I can't accept this, Tom."
Nature is changing.
Your demands are unreasonable.
That's not what Tom told me.
The bridge was built by the Romans.
I don't know where exactly.
Pack your bags.
Why should Tom return?
Tom said he'd love to go to Boston with us.
Tom wondered how Mary managed to win.
I don't think I should borrow any more money.
That's one of my favorite movies.
You can come in now.
I wasn't planning on telling you that.
I want you to go there.
Tom kissed Mary on the forehead.
I've had it. All I've done today is handle complaints.
I'm afraid I took the wrong train.
A lot has happened while you've been gone.
She asked him to not quit his job.
I only saw him once.
"I miss you, too."
Tom didn't love Mary as much as she loved him.
I think you'll enjoy this movie.
Isn't this great?
Are you trying to ruin my life?
Have you got a light?
Monday morning I was bitten by a dog.
Tom will be back next week.
ׁWhy didn't Tom tell the truth?
The situation was very tense.
Tom doesn't know what he'll do.
"So, what do you mean?"
You've probably done this many times before.
I don't like this at all.
Come quick!
I don't have anything to give to you.
Tom wants to do it.
Bananas are yellow.
"In addition to being a doctor, he is a writer."
Tom said that Mary wanted to talk to John.
"You know French, don't you?"
Tom could've done something.
We're looking for more volunteers.
Tom is a terrible dancer.
I'm a very smart person.
The old man lives alone.
Who are you? What're you doing here?
Tom had three children.
Many sects have initiation rituals for new members.
We aren't ready for this.
It's a very steep slope.
Didn't you know Tom was going to be there?
Tom said he was drunk.
He doesn't study as hard as he used to.
Tom and I were married in October.
Give us the details.
Tom and I did what we were told to do.
Who'd like to go first?
Tom is convinced that everyone hates him.
I'm sure that Tom mistook me for my brother.
Is that all you remember?
Let's ask Tom.
We're losing time.
Tom visited Australia in 2013.
What does your son do?
It's not easy for me.
I have to agree with you as well.
I don't like your patronising tone.
I met your French teacher yesterday.
I didn't know you used to live in Boston.
You know I couldn't do that.
Tom got arrested on his birthday.
Are you going to help us?
I started to cry.
Where did Tom buy these flowers?
This is the tallest building that I have ever seen.
Tom and his friends went outside to smoke.
And everyone has the ability to contribute.
Tom checked in at the Hilton Hotel.
We went inside.
Does that make any sense?
Don't expect anybody to help you.
It looks like it'll rain.
We discussed what to do.
Take your coat off and make yourself at home.
That's where we saw Tom last year.
I think you'll want to see this.
I haven't paid the fine yet.
Are you usually at home in the evening?
I know that Tom is a good violinist.
Don't you recognize Tom?
I want to find out the source of this irresponsible rumor.
Everything was prepared in advance.
Tom blushed at the thought.
I'm letting you go.
I assume Tom will be the same as he was the last time we saw him.
I don't know where to put this.
I don't think that anyone suspected you weren't Tom.
Men are all the same.
It's a pity that Tom is leaving.
Tom threw his line in and waited for the fish to bite.
You must've thought I was an idiot.
Tom couldn't remember where he'd heard her name.
"You know, maybe we should buy a computer instead."
I'm capable of making my own decisions.
Are they really serious?
I want to become rich.
"Of course, I'll go with you."
Can't you decide?
That's exactly what I need.
Why were you late this morning?
It was wise for you not to follow his advice.
Did you do that purposely?
Only six people came to the party.
"Tom Jackson works here, doesn't he?"
Don't break the branches.
Tom apparently didn't win.
Those who speak about happiness often have sad eyes.
Excuse me. Who are you?
I don't think Tom is as selfish as everyone thinks he is.
"Tom isn't Mary's son, but her nephew."
Let me explain how this works.
Are you ready for this?
I need a taxi.
Did Tom know you were here?
Was it a dream?
I broke the vase on purpose.
Tom said he heard a shot.
Tom barely knew Mary.
I am dozing.
The girl entered the room.
Tom turns thirteen in two days.
They'll need help.
No one noticed Tom.
Tom has a steady girlfriend.
Take a bite.
Maybe it's too late.
I don't understand the question.
Do you understand what he's saying?
Tom has tonsillitis.
I thought Tom could lend Mary some money.
I'm looking for some regular work.
Are you still afraid of dogs?
They're going to have a baby.
I thought the police were looking for Tom.
I'll demonstrate it for you.
I think we've fixed it.
Tom thought you could do that.
Tom said that wasn't the case.
Is Tom still engaged to Mary?
Tom tried.
What happens now?
Tom has a black eye.
This sentence is not French.
Tom went to Boston on October 20th.
I think Tom didn't understand you.
I'll miss you when you're gone.
I think Tom is impolite.
May I use the toilet?
He's likely to pass the entrance examination.
We met last week.
The teacher told Tom to shut up.
Tom hurt his knee playing basketball.
This elevator is out of order.
I didn't know it was important.
Can I help with breakfast?
This book is a good guide for beginners.
I'll look after your dog while you're away.
Are you lazy or just incompetent?
It doesn't look like you're very happy.
Tom shaves every morning.
Tom has been accused of cheating.
She is as beautiful as her mother is.
Is it enough?
Tom knew I was irritated.
He stuck to the original plan.
Tom still wants to come.
I shouldn't have told you about that.
This cell phone is really expensive.
Could you tell me something about yourself?
You don't have any proof.
I've got a ton of work to do.
I've paid already.
Trees give off oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide.
I am leaving town for a few days.
Wait a bit.
Haven't I told you this before?
Tom was my boss three years ago.
Tom waves to everyone.
Are you already in Boston?
Tom told me that Mary was thirsty.
I have to find another one.
Tom must be angry.
They don't respect you.
Tom is completely alone.
Laundry is a chore.
I'll let Tom know you're here.
I don't want to talk to Tom.
Just tell me why you're really here.
Did Tom change anything?
Tom rents a house with three bedrooms.
Tom traveled around Europe.
I'll put it on your bill.
I'm being watched.
Let's have a go at it.
I've always liked horror movies.
It's dead.
Meningitis is a terrible disease.
You'd better eat everything that's on your plate.
I've got to study.
Did you see the eclipse yesterday?
Thank you again for your help.
Leave me a message and I'll call you back.
I could do it.
Tom was disgusted.
I'll show you how to properly use it.
Tom is a gifted painter.
He has all kinds of books.
Tom was accused of stealing money from the cash register.
I don't think you should get married.
Tom is the boy I told you about.
It is clearing up.
The flood prevented me from crossing the river.
Tom is an embarrassment.
Your time has come.
I'm the boss now.
I thought I could help you.
Tom isn't the one who convinced Mary to do that.
Tom can't help us anymore.
I know that he went to London.
Tom is free.
Tom should apologize to you.
Tom didn't want to go out for a walk.
What're they doing?
I'll go to Boston and Chicago.
I can't put up with an insult like this.
Did Tom tell you where he was going?
He fell in love with her.
I don't think I have time to do that before lunch.
Tom is my aunt's ex-husband.
Spring is late this year.
I have to get back to my office.
What are you guys waiting for?
Women like men with mustaches.
Tom wrote a letter to himself.
What should I name it?
We don't need to go anywhere.
It is impossible to put the plan into practice.
I do a lot of swimming.
I like folk songs.
"The company, although with some exceptions, usually utilizes its resources very well."
Do you have a plan B?
Did anybody force you to do that?
Tom couldn't play the guitar.
Tom made this mistake intentionally.
Maybe I shouldn't have kissed you.
The folder is empty.
I love you anyway.
Tom didn't seem a bit surprised.
You killed my father.
I'll stay in the car.
He spent the morning reading a book.
We respect Tom.
Tom is doing a dangerous job.
I wish I knew what to do next.
What prevented you from coming earlier?
Have you talked to Tom?
Tom still has a few options.
I didn't recognize Tom.
I start work at nine.
Tom said Mary taught French.
He killed himself by taking poison.
I don't think that anybody else wants to do that.
Today is the first day of the rest of your life.
Are you students at this school?
I used to like swimming.
The last time I saw Tom was yesterday around lunchtime.
The doorbell is ringing.
Tom will need some persuasion.
It's going to happen again.
They were skiing.
Is that what the government wants?
Why are you sitting there?
Precision in measurement is necessary.
What would we do without you?
There is a lot of work to do.
Tom says Mary was sleepy.
You've made a bad mistake.
You're so picky.
I don't think Tom would notice that.
They don't know each other very well.
Is it the last lesson?
Don't you think it's weird?
How is life?
My friend was arrested for speeding.
Tom says he'll buy that for you.
I found the food too greasy.
These shoes are mine.
Don't let Tom sleep.
Tom looked through the periscope.
Here's $10.00.
I can't speak for my colleagues.
I saw Tom pick it up and put it in his pocket.
No one knows where she is.
Never leave me again.
How long do you think it would take you to paint my house?
I hear you're moving back to Boston.
We are all accustomed to working late at night.
Tom was too drunk to drive home.
I think we should wait.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
I just want to humiliate Tom.
Tom never said he would babysit for us.
I'm naked.
Did they go to museum by bus?
That man is strong.
She didn't go yesterday.
Tom travels around the world playing concerts.
Why didn't I think of that?
Tom has to pay another three hundred dollars.
There's nothing else.
Stop correcting me.
I see no reason to stop.
I said goodbye to Tom.
Do you want to look into it?
Is he really coming?
Tom said you didn't like sports.
We went aboard the plane.
An unforgettable event occurred.
I'm afraid I can't tell you that.
I found the building.
How many cups of coffee did you drink?
Did Tom tell you what he told me?
What kind of nonsense is that?
I didn't want to shoot my dog.
I'm not sure what Tom is trying to say.
Do you think Tom likes you?
Did you ask Tom if he could do that?
Tom and Mary look relieved.
I was searching for food.
The bird flapped its wings.
If you don't keep quiet I'll punch you in the nose.
Will you drink another cup of coffee?
You are going too far.
I agree with Tom on that point.
How much more water do we have?
I didn't go to school.
There are people who are afraid of spiders.
Don't do anything until I come.
I don't have to apologize to Tom.
I gave him all the money I had.
My mother bought two bottles of orange juice.
I knew you'd want to do that.
Will this year be different?
You were invited.
I'd like to make a suggestion.
You were too slow.
I didn't know Tom didn't have a driver's license.
I like swimming.
Tom changed his mind at the last minute.
Tom has no idea where he left his keys.
Why doesn't Tom trust you?
Why couldn't you just say no?
"Tom said he wouldn't do that, so I asked Mary to."
"You'll go with us, won't you?"
Tom hired a new secretary.
Tom is wearing a new pair of shoes.
Try to make sure Tom doesn't do something stupid.
You can sleep on the couch.
I can't do what you're asking me to do.
Try something new.
Do it again!
I don't understand music.
Tom pointed to the fire escape.
Botany deals with the study of plants.
Don't use too much pepper.
We suspected our cashier of stealing the funds.
What more can you show me?
I am not ready yet.
This book is hers.
Have you been fired?
There was a tense atmosphere in the room.
Delete that picture.
Tom took the key out of his pocket.
"It's a good plan, isn't it?"
You aren't young.
The road runs right by my house.
Tom wanted to see what was up.
Did you ask your father?
Are you really the one who did that?
A car stopped at the entrance.
Tom listened to the sound of the waves crashing on the beach.
He can't do that.
I think it's going to be very hot today.
It'll be hot.
I didn't want Tom to leave.
Tom says it was a mistake.
I sure hope Tom doesn't do that.
It was hard at first.
Tom put the kettle on the stove.
You should visit Boston.
I took another sip.
I'm not as stubborn as Tom is.
Tom took a picture of Mary's new car and sent it to John.
They called you.
It was warm.
Call an ambulance.
There is no smoke without fire.
I'm hungry!
Has anybody spoken to you?
That's beside the point.
I'm helping Tom.
Tom spit out his gum.
I'm sure Tom is suffering.
I wasn't sure what to expect.
Can you wait a bit?
Was it good?
Am I supposed to be impressed by that?
Tom went over and sat down next to Mary.
I'm going to go wash my hair.
Please let me talk to Tom.
I don't even want to know.
Tom didn't trust Mary.
I'm glad you're back.
Tom talked too much.
I'm not used to doing that in the dark.
"Had I known the truth, I would have told it to you."
I couldn't sleep either.
What Tom told you wasn't true.
I don't believe a word Tom says.
We don't yet know if that's going to happen or not.
The most important feature of all games is that they are governed by rules.
We waited in the park for a long time.
Tom became a father when he was thirty.
You'd love it.
Tom was very sick.
Tom told me he didn't know.
It's pretty convincing.
You're not that old.
She seems to be a good cook.
They allow parking here.
I know that Tom didn't go to Boston.
That's going to cause problems.
That's dishonest.
What did you want to say to me yesterday?
I didn't know you were a poet.
What is the most popular play now?
The suspect was taken to the police station for further questioning.
Tom put the coins into the box.
You didn't hear this from me.
Tom began to suspect that Mary was lying to him.
It isn't going to happen.
I've decided not to go to Australia.
I never told you that.
There is a bookstore in front of the department store.
Tom told us everything.
Tom asked Mary to wear something nice.
I want you to wear this one.
I think that's an exaggeration.
You must do it at once.
There is no shame in being poor.
You shouldn't speak to your parents that way.
I already have one of these.
"You hate us, don't you?"
I have a lawyer.
Just sign here.
Let's sit where there is some shade.
I have to do that by Monday.
Can you fix this?
Tom is living with his uncle now.
He was wrong in thinking that she'd come to see him.
Mary married Tom after his wife died.
My sister-in-law had four children in five years.
Nara is an old city worth visiting at least once in your life.
You said we could go.
I'd love to be able to spend less time doing household chores.
"Tom speaks French well, though not perfectly."
Let's approach the problem from a different angle.
Pull the string and the water flushes.
It probably is my fault.
Do you know what's in those containers?
I don't know any French songs.
It's much too cold to swim.
I will not see him any more.
I don't know which child is yours.
Didn't you sing?
He's scared to talk to me.
You're in no position to bargain.
I asked her out.
We were concerned.
I pretended that I couldn't understand French.
Tom ran back to his room.
Where are my parents?
Stay in your car.
"Tom likes tea, but Mary doesn't."
Tom likes his new car.
Tom will tell Mary everything.
I don't speak a word of French.
What is this place?
I can't do this anymore.
They broke the silence.
One is red and the other is white.
I can't trust you anymore.
It is said that the fox is more cunning than any other animal.
Put them on the table.
We need Tom's help.
Tom warned Mary not to lend money to John.
I prefer to work at night.
He won the race easily.
Nothing happened.
Tom could've told me the truth.
I wouldn't leave without you.
Tom is not my son.
Let's take a look.
I can't give up now.
Boys can't enter the girls' dormitories.
Eight plus two is ten.
"He speaks not only Spanish, but also French."
Tom thought I was lying.
Everyone is gone now.
Do you have something to show me?
Tom told me he had a job for me.
You've become old and stubborn.
The difference in their ages is six years.
The monkey is in the cage.
Where did you get the idea?
That must've happened while I was in Boston.
Tom has rejected our offer.
Does Tom work for Mary?
I'm the happiest man in the world.
I asked Tom how much time he thought it would take.
That's milk.
Speak a little louder.
I want Tom to help me clean the house.
We all knew Tom wasn't bluffing.
What subject do you think he is interested in?
He confessed that he was guilty.
It's as easy as pie.
Can we talk about it?
That's exactly what I want you to do.
I don't want to go home.
Tom's birthday is October 20th.
Tom told me he was curious.
I wonder how all of this happened.
How do you know I didn't do that?
She gave me a doll.
Don't worry. I'll protect you.
This is a serious mistake.
"You're not married, are you?"
I may stay in Boston for another day.
I've never told anybody this before.
I hope Tom didn't notice what you were doing.
I should have left earlier.
Did you play tennis yesterday?
Tom asked Mary to take out the garbage.
Tell me how to do that.
The subway entrance is on the corner.
Tom said you would come.
I have more skirts than my big sister.
Have you fired Tom?
Tom told me not to open it.
Tom asked Mary whether she liked him.
How did you get back so soon?
Isn't that why you're here?
How do you expect me to help?
Tom's story had a happy ending.
I'll help you pack.
Call me at this number.
I paid a lot of money for these tickets.
Tom is a farmer.
They were lucky.
This is entirely your fault.
Why do boys and girls like different toys?
Don't you threaten me.
It was so still that you would have heard a pin drop.
Please wash these clothes.
Tom went into his bedroom.
You know who she is.
I like this one best.
Tom has never been here.
I was young and stupid.
I must contact Tom.
Tom happened to meet Mary at the supermarket.
Where are you planning to go?
I'd like you to come with us.
Tom said he regretted not following Mary's advice.
Tom dove into the cold water.
You'll get into trouble if your parents find out.
I never claimed that I could speak French.
He entered his room.
Are you with someone?
Tom has done a great job.
I said I would tell you.
What did Tom draw on the blackboard?
Sometimes I'm right and sometimes I'm wrong.
I have a Vietnamese friend. Her name is Tiên.
Tom said that he used to live in Boston.
I thought you'd agree with me.
It's always cold in here.
I don't know when I should come.
The choice is yours.
I don't expect anything from you.
Have you been told about the problem?
Tom seems busy.
He doesn't sleep.
Who do you think told Tom?
You're perfectly right.
I want to talk with Tom.
How old might his grandfather be?
Tom will be buried tomorrow.
Tell Tom it was all my fault.
He ran faster than his brother did.
I don't feel like going out.
"Clean it up, Tom."
"Bring me a glass of water, please."
Tom stayed in Boston for three months.
My sister is a very beautiful girl.
Would you mind ironing this shirt for me?
Is this all yours?
"When I opened the door, I found him asleep."
Tom wanted me to do him a favor.
I think Tom cheated.
I'm saying I'm not sure.
Tom's dog bit Mary.
Tom has three bicycles.
I can cook very well.
This desk is mine.
You are about my age.
We raised quite a bit of money.
This is Mary's husband.
Tom tried to start the engine.
I thought you'd want to see this movie.
Can I have another sandwich?
Tom couldn't find his keys.
They swam out to the island.
Is it clear?
I fainted.
That's why I like Tom.
Tom needed rest.
You said that it was important.
We need to do something quickly.
I have brought you what you asked for.
You're very open.
I lied.
I look like my father.
Tom quickly climbed up the tree.
I didn't know you didn't live in Boston anymore.
I haven't paid Tom yet.
"At last, the rain stopped."
How many cars do you have?
Tom is pretty young.
I asked my mother if breakfast was ready.
I'll come alone.
That's one of my favorites.
I gave him a fake name.
Winter in this area was extremely cold.
I didn't swim yesterday.
We need to discuss this.
It appears we have a problem.
Tom isn't here now.
You're a dreamer.
Everyone calls him Tom.
Did Tom see it?
I've never seen you laugh before.
I don't think Tom is the one who needs to apologize.
I'm ignoring you.
It is clear that he is at home.
Tom was shocked to learn that Facebook collected so much information on him.
I don't walk anywhere.
I brought a pie.
I want to write this down.
I don't think that Tom knows I'm here.
I wonder where Tom lives.
I don't like this neighborhood much.
They won't give themselves up.
Could you explain it more simply?
I didn't tell Tom that I knew you.
Tom doesn't want to study medicine.
I spent most of the day in bed.
What was his reaction to this news?
You'll feel at home.
The worst is behind us.
We need to speak to Tom.
I think you understand what I mean.
Tom is likely to never do that.
I'm warm.
We're always busy at this time of the year.
Do seedless watermelons exist?
I want to learn how to say this word in Arabic.
Tom wasn't worried about Mary.
I told you not to do anything stupid.
I'd like to say goodbye.
How much wine is left?
Tom gave me another chance.
I'm highly impressed.
I knew you knew the answer.
"We need to invest in clean, renewable energy."
Tom is still a rookie.
You're very successful.
I don't know how to contact you.
They do it faster than me.
Why do you want to become a bus driver?
We'll take care of everything.
Bird watching is a nice hobby.
Aren't you taller than Tom?
Is Tom being charged with a crime?
Anyone could do that.
I just needed more time.
Tom brought Mary a box of chocolates.
Tom keeps his car clean.
I know Tom does that a lot.
Are you going to work today?
The car moved very slowly.
It's 3:30.
Did anybody follow you?
Look out! There's a car coming.
I have to go to the bank this morning.
I'm not too worried about the future.
I don't want to wait till the last minute.
Tom often contradicts himself.
He looked up at the stars.
A taxi is more expensive than a bus.
I want to build a house here.
Tom lived a simple life.
Let's try one more.
I don't feel like doing it.
I wanted Tom to go away and leave me in peace.
Where is the nearest bank?
I have nothing to say to any of you.
Remove that jacket.
I started working here three weeks ago.
Tom has never talked about it.
Guess what I've got.
I hadn't thought about that.
"Hurry up, Tom."
I want the blanket.
I think you're on the right track.
"If you're planning to go to Australia, let's go together."
Do you want me to leave?
"Tom is very honest, so I'm sure we can rely on him."
How did you learn to do that?
We never lose.
I think you're the only one who cares.
Help is on the way.
Let me take you home.
"To make matters worse, it began to rain."
I have trouble understanding your French.
Fossil fuels won't be available forever.
Tom went to Boston.
Let's say that you're right.
I won't allow it!
Have you already been there?
Lightning struck his house.
I swim almost every day in the summer.
Here's a picture of Tom.
That's a question for others to answer.
I just wanted to make you happy.
I'll accompany you to the hospital.
My daughter's your age.
I'm glad you know the truth.
"From my point of view, it would be better to wait a little longer."
The boy came back.
Don't blame Tom for what happened.
Don't try to make me angry.
His socks are purple.
I was just kidding.
Tell us what happened to you.
I don't know any of those people.
Are you accusing me?
Tom asked me to talk with you.
It's not a difficult question.
I can't imagine life on another planet.
You were useless.
Tom's joke went over Mary's head.
Money is the root of all evil.
He put special emphasis on the problem.
"If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
Maybe you're seeing what you want to see.
What museums would you recommend I visit?
Tom and I were talking about Boston.
Did you like Boston?
When will they open the meeting?
Tom was puzzled.
Tom decided not to go with us.
I don't like walking home alone after dark.
Murders are very common in big cities.
I don't have the answer to your question.
There was a lot of food in the house.
We need to start working on the problem.
Tom still hasn't done his homework.
Tom fell from the tree.
Did Tom tell you we were coming?
What was your job?
We were just about to call you.
Some people questioned his honesty.
Can you remember the first word you learned in English?
It was your mistake.
You did an incredible job.
What's in those cases?
Don't say I didn't warn.
Show it to Tom and me.
When did you realize that?
Girls say that all the time.
I was serious.
I think that ghosts exist.
He knew it all along.
I thought that he had already finished the work.
He speaks Arabic.
I suspect that you won't like it.
Tom failed to pass his driving test.
They know something we don't.
Tom nodded.
You're a lot like Tom.
You can't make an omelet without breaking eggs.
Are you free tomorrow evening?
Giant pandas live only in China.
Tom is a cameraman.
I shouldn't have done this.
"So, did you buy it for Tom?"
Never come back here again.
I know Tom is a good teacher.
She wouldn't allow me to read the letter.
He could speak French.
You must not lose sight of your main object.
We hope that you won't be late.
Tell me what'll happen.
Everybody does that.
I know where Tom is.
Tom wanted Mary to go to Boston to visit her uncle.
Can you teach me some French words?
Didn't you know that Tom and Mary often travel together?
The death of her husband changed her life completely.
Aren't you going to help Tom?
I'll buy it.
Keep notes.
I came here to study.
Take a look at this map.
That is all.
Tom and Mary have decided to get married.
"Here, drink this."
I know that you don't know who I am.
The president made a statement on the issue.
Are your eyes open?
Tom's son's name is John.
He's stupid.
Do you smell something?
I paid a fine.
Jet planes fly much faster than propeller planes.
Tom declined to comment on the matter.
You made a fool of yourself.
I'm going to be your teacher.
We must respect Tom's decision.
Tom is mean.
They only sell women's shoes here.
Brazil is a big country.
You're really getting prettier and prettier.
"Tom knew the answer, but didn't say anything."
I eat three times a day.
Is Tom in pain?
That's not what Tom wants you to do.
Can we talk about something else please?
Basketball is a lot of fun.
I was writing a letter.
Tom gave his seat to the old woman.
Do you want me to sing?
Tom did what I wanted him to do.
We surrendered.
You ruined everything.
Tom wasn't in class yesterday.
Are you happy with your appearance?
How long does it take from here to your house on foot?
Do you like flying?
Tom wanted to know where it happened.
Tom is being a jerk.
Tom told me to wait outside.
They agreed to raise wages and to stop hiring children.
Did you look under the car?
Tom is an amazing man.
She goes to the movies once a week.
The temperature fell.
We all know what'll happen.
Tom answered correctly.
Some residents took a wait-and-see attitude while others prepared for heavy flooding.
Tom and John both married younger women.
I don't know exactly where Tom lives.
Can I eat?
Tom turned off his computer.
It's not a watch.
Why can't I do that?
Does Mary really love me?
I should've run away then.
He started his day with a good breakfast.
Kids go to school to study.
Are you sure that you want to do this?
He's a doctor of good reputation.
I want you to know who I am.
We found her alive.
I saw a whale tail today.
Cue cards are used primarily on television to help the actors remember their lines.
I'm sorry that I broke my promise.
They're wrong.
Tom knew I would do whatever he asked.
Tom and I went fishing.
That's an exception.
I think I'm going to be here on Monday.
Someone stole Tom's car.
Is that our problem?
Has Tom ever ridden a horse?
What are you trying to tell us?
I have lunch plans with Tom.
My problem is that I'm always hungry.
We all enjoyed the movie.
I hope you didn't do that.
I have trouble remembering names.
I think I have a fever.
Tom had no place to go.
I will miss you all.
I didn't deserve to go to prison.
Tom should've told Mary that he was married.
Now drink up.
Nobody has seen Tom for years.
He held his breath.
Tom has it wrong.
Give it to Tom and me.
I have to finish my book.
She failed to understand a single word.
Ask Tom what his plans are.
I need an envelope and a piece of paper. I also need either a pencil or a pen.
I hope you won't leave me here.
I'm disappointed.
"Then he got dressed, stuffed his lecture notes into his briefcase, and ran down the stairs."
He was a brave soldier.
I've got a job.
Tom can't just quit.
She knows her limitations.
They weren't listening to music.
Open the windows.
I'm not sure if it's a compliment or an insult.
I want a suit made of this material.
He isn't richer than me.
Tom was about thirty years old when he started studying French.
Would you get me something to drink?
I'm tired and I want to go to bed.
This possibility can't be ruled out.
I haven't seen you for a long time.
I waited.
"Unfortunately, the information is accurate."
All but Tom were present.
Tom felt a little dazed.
Please listen.
Don't worry about Tom. He isn't a threat.
Tom was surprised by Mary's comment.
The attack was foiled.
I don't talk like that.
Tom spoiled the movie for Mary by telling her how it ends.
I figured you wouldn't want the teacher to know you hadn't done your homework yet.
Tom is actually Mary's brother.
We're not leaving without Tom.
I don't know what Tom had to do.
Tom lost his key.
I don't have the letter on me now.
That's why I came.
Has Tom been convicted?
Tom met John in prison.
Tom was left alone.
Mary was Tom's first girlfriend.
Why do you hate us?
Tom is a fat man.
Could you give me a wake-up call at seven?
I just want this day to be over.
Have you ordered?
My mother is not always at home.
Tom doesn't want to make Mary angry.
You have a guest.
We're meant to be together.
I have a ton of things to do.
You look older.
Tom still hasn't cleaned his room.
We don't need to go there.
You're so lazy.
Tom recognized Mary's dog.
I thought that you wanted to watch that movie.
Where did you learn to do this?
Do you want me to write it down?
I didn't know that Tom had left home.
I intend to come.
I'd rather die.
I have a black dog and a white dog.
This hat belongs to me.
The restaurant was far from the train station.
He blew out the candle.
He watched a basketball game on TV last night.
We tried.
The only one who knows where Mary is is Tom.
This is a bad time.
How could this happen?
I reviewed the file.
I found it difficult to get along with him.
Can you help me find it?
How exactly did this happen?
Listen to Tom.
Tom will wait.
I suspect that Tom won't need to do that anymore.
Tom and Mary have broken off their engagement.
He gave it a new name.
It would take me too much time to explain to you why it's not going to work.
Let's go back to the motel.
I don't think I'll be able to fix it.
How much damage was done?
"All I need is some hot water, soap and a towel."
The pen is on the table.
Go up these stairs.
Why are you always so pessimistic?
You're doing that much better today.
Didn't you know Mary and Alice were sisters?
"If you do that, I'll do that, too."
I've got to do that today.
One of my horses died yesterday.
Your team is stronger than ours.
We only need a few more minutes.
You are beautiful.
We were invited.
Tom went to buy another pair of shoes.
You should return home before it gets dark.
Where can I park my car?
I found this today.
Tom was wearing a tuxedo.
"Could you call again later, please?"
I stopped.
Will you come with me to the concert?
I know who gave that to you.
Tom carried his duffel bag on his shoulder.
I need to know when you plan to do that.
Do you know what color she likes?
Did you catch the train?
"Do you have a problem with this, too?"
Tom's answers were correct.
I don't know what to do now.
Tom appreciated Mary's advice.
I knew it was a bad idea.
Tom looked at his dog.
You are now an adult.
Thousands have been left homeless.
I think Tom is still married.
Let's not waste any more time on this.
Tom has been working as Mary's chauffeur for years.
Everyone's going to be tired.
Let's play ball.
I've got no problems at all with it.
How can you be so sure?
Tom is a therapist.
Tom learned how to do that from Mary.
I think we impressed Tom.
I think that Tom forgot to do that.
Tom is just a teenager.
Pick me up at 2:30.
I don't care if it's a bit cold.
Do you want kids?
I consider Tom handsome.
We had a lot of problems yesterday.
I almost never do that anymore.
Tom celebrated his twentieth birthday last week.
I'm afraid he's just gone out.
We must achieve our aim at any price.
I wonder whether Tom will ever come home.
Tom helped the injured man.
The months slipped by and still there was no news of him.
It was the happiest day of my life.
Why is Tom home?
What did you study?
I helped them yesterday.
That's too long.
I don't know whether you like her or not.
Tom'll cry.
I'll bear it in mind.
Lots of people in Japan are indifferent to politics.
Tom needs clothes.
I'd be grateful if you could help me.
Let me tell you why I don't like Tom.
"You have to take all this medicine to get better, said the nurse."
The idea is not new.
Did you know that was there?
Tom opened the hood of the car.
Your snoring kept me up all night.
Haven't I told you not to call me Tom?
Don't take it personally.
What kind of movie is it? Is it popular?
I don't think that you have to do that by yourself.
All insects have six legs.
Try to be yourself.
Can you explain that to me again?
What is this?
Please tell me what the rules are.
Tom said he didn't have time to eat now.
Give it back.
Let me think for a while.
Everything is quiet.
The bomb was defused by the bomb squad.
I was speechless.
A person who steals deserves punishment.
Tom tried to understand.
I didn't mean to insult you.
Could we sit?
We started our spring plowing early this year.
He's not the same man he used to be.
"Even though Tom is sick, he's planning on going to school."
The sun is setting below the horizon.
Tom and Mary are wealthy.
They offered me the job.
He acts like a rock star.
My throat hurts when I swallow.
I'm glad Tom was able to win.
Please don't be angry.
Tom didn't know Mary had a brother.
Tom won't understand this.
I'm quite young.
He didn't want to think about it.
I knew you were OK.
I want to talk to her.
I sweat a lot.
"If he had not died so young, he would have become a great scientist."
It's a very serious issue.
Tom warned Mary not to eat anything John made.
I couldn't let Tom die.
Let's not talk about that.
We both need more time.
How did you know who to give that to?
It's all you can do for now.
This costs almost nothing.
We're both very happy here.
I don't know how to stop it.
Who told you I would help you?
May I talk to you a minute?
I had an awful night.
This city has many historical buildings.
This is also my first time.
We could both go.
Go straight home.
I suspect you know why I'm here.
"Where are you going, Tom?"
Please help me open this door.
Women like Tom and me.
Tom hit a deer.
He met with an accident.
We want your advice.
Her new novel will be out next month.
Tom and I are both busy.
I'm safe now.
I was expecting you.
Look at my arm.
Tom can't afford to buy a car.
I don't want you to go back to Boston.
It was snowing that day.
Don't you forget that.
Hope to see you again next year.
I have no idea. That's why I'm asking.
They're right behind you.
Tom is my favorite singer.
I'll show you the way.
"If anyone can do it, it's Tom."
I can't find my watch.
I heard it on the news today.
I know that you're guilty.
Why can't you do what you're told?
Just let me see it.
The baby has fallen asleep.
Settle down!
I have no idea who it was.
What if I'm right?
Everyone should know this.
I've received another message from Tom.
Is the cafeteria open yet?
Tom stayed late.
Tom and Mary aren't coming.
I'm loved.
"Tom, be careful!"
I bought a hybrid.
Tom pulled the arrow out of Mary's leg.
Bring the kids.
Tom was sitting alone at the kitchen table when Mary walked in.
I didn't sing.
I still love Tom.
Be ready for anything.
The players on this team are all giants.
I've been in Australia since October.
He cleared his throat.
We're having cold cuts for supper.
We traveled together.
Are you wearing makeup?
Did Tom tell you where he bought it?
He asked her out on a date.
Why do you love me?
There are many others.
I want the truth from you.
Tom tried to cover up his mistake.
Tom is more famous than Mary.
Tom and I are going to Boston tomorrow.
When do you leave here?
You live too far away.
The horse would not move.
What should I do in order to save time?
I wanted to stay in Boston.
It seems that Tom knows the secret.
"Tom is a student, isn't he?"
You're going to like it.
Can you translate this song for me?
You're contradicting yourself.
Some people think so.
Don't worry. I've already taken care of it.
I want you to meet someone.
I have a telephone.
A strong wind blew all day long.
We went on talking about the matter.
Tom and Mary are going to get married.
I can do my job without your help.
The story is based on his own experience.
Tom doesn't need that.
I love my dad.
These are ostrich eggs.
That's not what we were talking about.
I don't like spiders.
Tom said he didn't know where Mary lived.
He's married to an American woman.
We went out to dinner.
You can save yourself the trouble.
I can't go in there.
Tom always kept his mouth shut.
I'm just a messenger.
I'm really proud of you.
What day is it today?
Three months is a long time to wait.
"Tom is in the garden, pulling weeds."
"How are you feeling now, Tom?"
It is no use arguing with such a foolish man.
I've got to make lunch.
I can't afford to buy both.
Tom went on a safari in Africa.
Tom said he doesn't care at all.
Tom believes Mary.
Tom knows him.
Tom said that he didn't want me to help him do that.
You and I both know that that isn't going to happen.
Last night was unusually cold.
"Good morning, everybody."
Tom believes the system is broken.
Did Tom work for you?
Does your wife know?
"He ran across the street, leaving her alone."
You would've liked it.
I doubt you'll be able to do that.
Do you happen to know where Tom lives?
The pen I lost yesterday was a new one.
Take that one.
"I, too, would like to know."
I told Tom not to wait.
Tom is hard of hearing.
I was hoping you'd sing with us.
I didn't think it'd happen this quickly.
Have you told anyone what your real name is?
It happened prior to my arrival.
"With the exception of him, nobody else came to the party."
I'm not certain.
Who's your doctor?
Tom threw another log on the fire.
We're a little early.
Why is Tom afraid to do that?
I didn't know you'd won the race.
Don't use too much glue.
I know that you believe me.
You won.
I knew Tom wouldn't accept our offer.
Tom looks terrible.
Put out the fire.
You're weak.
Tom is playing in the yard.
I think we all know the rules.
"What did you say? ""I didn't say anything."""
Which tie do you think goes best with this shirt?
I'll fix it.
Tom asked Mary to meet him at the airport.
I know how to do my job.
It looks like Tom is sleeping.
Tom is worried about what might happen.
You seem to be making progress.
I think Tom isn't the right man for the job.
Tom won't have to apologize.
We didn't see any girls in the group.
He is always right.
Does your father work?
I find it difficult to believe.
Have you figured out what went wrong?
You can always rely on Tom.
Don't wash your dirty linen in public.
I am fed up with his vulgar jokes.
You shouldn't eat anything spicy.
Tom walked to the store to buy some milk.
Tom told me that I shouldn't be doing this.
Tell Tom I don't want to go.
I thought that we had more time.
I know what's up.
You must make a choice.
The first class begins at 8:30.
Tom will go to Australia.
I felt the wind blowing on my face.
"I thought doing this would be easy, but we've been working all day and we're still not finished."
It's unlikely Tom will win.
I like watching movies.
Tom was allowed to stay.
What kind of dreams do you have?
It doesn't change the facts.
You need to sign that.
Do you like my car?
I joined the team yesterday.
Did you tell them anything?
Tom will leave early.
Where are you going to move?
I'm completely wrecked.
What makes you think I'm lying?
I'm cleaning my room.
Tom lowered his voice.
I'm going to put it in my room.
I consider this temporary.
I'm not that wild.
Tom isn't busy.
Have you fixed the thermostat?
When will breakfast be ready?
Tom and Mary quickly became friends.
I'll never tell anybody.
Won't you have some coffee?
Do you want my help?
I take care of the garden.
We should be able to be there by 2:30.
Where does Tom stay?
We're not doing anything now.
I got dressed quickly.
Did we forget anything?
Where were you? Everyone is looking for you.
I'm happier than you.
I teach French to adults.
They caught me with my pants down.
Take off your glasses.
Mary is wearing a silver ring.
I hope Tom resigns.
Tom will want to go with us.
I had never been kissed like that before.
He sat surrounded by his children.
Please don't ask Tom.
Tom told Mary not to worry.
Is this jasmine tea?
He adapted himself to circumstances.
I think you're capable of anything.
I'm in trouble. I need your help.
I must have misunderstood.
Tom got lost in Boston.
Did Tom need help?
What kind of birds are there in Australia?
I won't live like that.
"Pardon me, do you speak English?"
This play has ended.
Neither Tom nor Mary has been punished.
I hate that more than anything.
Tom and Mary sat together.
What kind of bird is this?
I never would've guessed.
I did that last night.
I watched Tom swim.
Nobody stood up.
It's worse than you think.
Tom isn't Mary's brother.
I think you know that's not a good idea.
I don't understand what you mean.
These trees will never bear fruit.
Do you play baseball?
I'm younger than you are.
It may break.
I've answered your questions.
I don't want to go to my room.
We found the front door locked.
The fan is over my head.
I have to see this.
Tom told me he wants to do that.
"If I knew that, I'd tell you."
"Tom doesn't feed his dog in the morning, only in the evening."
You look happy.
Bite the bullet.
I heard a noise up there.
Let's get a beer.
Why do you live alone?
"You didn't expect to find me here, did you?"
I just wanted to see you one last time.
What are you doing on Monday?
I bet my bottom dollar he is innocent.
Tom and Mary broke up three weeks ago.
I like movies.
"I'd rather have a room of my own, no matter how small it is."
Tom enjoys playing golf.
Tom just wanted to make sure that's what you meant.
It's now time to act.
I'm not going to read it.
Won't you come in?
It was such a shock.
You may go there.
You're replaceable.
I have been writing this manuscript for a year.
"If you change your mind, let me know."
That's my theory.
He's not a bad boy.
Tom boiled some water.
I bought a book about animals.
Tom has started looking for a new job.
Tom has a car now.
Tom doesn't smoke marijuana.
This is third-rate tobacco.
I thought you said that you didn't want to do that.
I won't have to do that myself.
He's a very nice boy.
I'm sure you would have done the same for me.
I saw Tom at the airport.
How effective is it?
I have a problem with my car.
It was an impulse buy.
You're so nice.
What do you think about it? It'd be great!
I had to go to Boston by myself.
I still think we're safe.
Who sent this to us?
Is there anything wrong with that television?
I caught a glimpse of her face.
I didn't want that.
They've just left.
This is an apple tree.
What's the name of your pharmacy?
This is a horse.
My sister doesn't have a car.
Go ahead and sing.
What do you want me to see?
Tom is hard to get along with.
Even I can't explain it.
I bought three tickets.
Tom nodded thoughtfully.
Tom just called.
Excuse me for not having answered your letter sooner.
Tom looks absolutely furious.
Tom said that he already did that.
Do I need to go now?
We can talk after dinner.
Where's the milk?
Tom and Mary usually go to school by bicycle.
We can talk over lunch.
Tom nodded to Mary.
There's no use crying for help. No one will hear you.
Give that to Tom and me.
I don't think that anybody else wants to do that.
You didn't need to come so early.
Does your invitation still stand?
Don't you know who that is?
Tom and I eat lunch together.
There is no table in the room.
Tom wanted to leave Australia.
I don't understand why you didn't do that.
"Tom dropped his glass, but it didn't break."
I watched a movie in French with English subtitles.
I said I'd wait.
What did you do last week?
Tom needs me.
I'm so proud of Tom.
Tom tried to run.
I know Tom might've done that on purpose.
"If you're cold, come here and sit down by the fire."
Why were you absent yesterday?
"Because of my job, I will be in Tokyo next week."
I worry about you.
I thought you'd be happy.
I need to focus.
I told Tom to give me a call.
The box Tom gave me contained potatoes.
This is my favorite place in the world.
The enemy dropped bombs on the factory.
I could fall in love with you.
"It's hard to be a woman. One must think like a man, act like a lady, look like a girl, and work like a horse."
Long skirts are very much in fashion.
This is a bad thing.
Let's play cards.
He's interested in Mayan prophecies.
Are you still hungry?
He was caught in an ambush.
We're trapped!
Let me give you some examples.
I've already fixed it.
Aren't you going to work today?
Tom painted the ceiling white.
She denied that she had stolen anything.
Please find out where he is.
"You know what this is, don't you?"
Don't worry. He knows what he's doing.
Christmas is just a week away.
I'm going there alone.
We're looking for Tom.
You could count to ten when you were two years old.
They made a joke of the whole thing.
I like beer.
You never liked Tom.
The elevator isn't working today.
It took me more than two hours to translate a few pages of English.
I think you'll enjoy this movie.
I never should've gone there by myself.
"Pass the sugar, please."
Tom doesn't want to go.
A flock of sheep was grazing in the fields.
Only Tom knows that.
Tom was tough.
They're not hungry.
I wish that were true.
Tom left about an hour ago.
Tom and I were business partners.
Tom wouldn't go with us.
Tom stuck out his tongue.
I wish you hadn't told me that.
He caught the first train and got there just in time.
Tom wanted you to come.
Hand me the briefcase.
Mary is an extremely beautiful woman.
He forgot that he bought her a present.
Tom's listening.
I saw you crying.
We need to talk to everyone.
"I tried to persuade him, but in vain."
"You can do it, too."
"Which do you like better, this one or that one?"
Tom is the only one who can answer that question.
You look stunning.
Get out of our way.
"Everybody, let's have a good year."
Open your book to page ten.
I told her to come visit us.
My father gave it to me when I was a kid.
Tom is eating with a spoon.
I need to find Tom now.
It'll happen again.
I almost forgot.
Did you say Tom was going to be late?
How could you not tell me about that?
Tom didn't stay there for long.
Tom is in bed.
Just who are you anyway?
Where did you put the screwdriver?
Everyone is proud of you.
They kept walking.
I want to eat spaghetti.
That's my sole concern.
I don't need that anymore.
Please don't tell my wife.
I want to try this.
He put his hands in his pockets.
I knew I didn't have anything to worry about.
He looked around.
Mathematics is an interesting subject.
That's not the way it happened.
Do you want to do that?
I'd like to know as well.
How long have you been in Australia?
You won't need me.
"Instead of going back to the party, why don't we go to my place?"
It looks like Tom is upset.
Is the post office still closed?
How can Tom win?
I plan to tell them about you.
Tom should still be in the library.
What caused the accident?
Is there anything in this box?
I know you don't speak French very well.
Let's go eat.
Tom has bought a new car.
Tom thinks Mary won't ever come back.
Tom's salary is much higher than mine.
Maybe I could help Tom do that.
Tom is still feeding the pigeons.
I'm in your hands.
I think that Tom should do that.
Tom is listed as dead.
I'm more experienced than you are.
You don't owe me anything.
I was in the gym.
Tom is getting scared.
"If he tried hard, he would succeed."
I play tennis every Sunday.
Tom wants dessert.
I tried to avoid talking about that.
I doubt it'll snow today.
I told you not to call me on weekends.
I don't think I know anyone here.
I hate people like that.
Are you going to do that?
Do you want Tom to help you?
Tom and I are going to Boston for a conference.
Tom never forgets to call his mother on her birthday.
Don't call Tom anymore.
I'd have waited for you.
This can't be a coincidence.
Those children are cheerful.
Who else do you know here?
I called Tom yesterday.
I want to do everything Tom did.
We don't have much snow here even in the winter.
Don't forget this.
I don't like studying.
I was in the middle of reading when I had a call from her.
What was in the box?
Tom doesn't want to come.
I think that Tom hates us.
I'm not the only one who wants to go.
Tom waited for Mary outside.
I told Tom Mary wanted to do that.
Whatever you say.
I hear there was an earthquake in Shizuoka.
Never tell anyone.
"If you're wrong, admit it. If you're right, be quiet."
Tom asked Mary if she wanted coffee.
He comes to visit us every now and then.
Tom lives with his mother.
Do we still have time?
Do you want to know how I feel?
I'm much older than you are.
I'm feeling cold.
Are you avoiding me?
They captured an American fort in northern Michigan.
Tom will be thirty years old in October.
You must be strong.
I don't want to end up in prison.
You're just like Tom.
What else are you good at doing?
How do you know so much?
Can I have some more milk?
Tom ended up in second place.
Sometimes you have to surrender.
She looks as if she had seen a ghost.
I see Tom trusts you.
Tom has quite a lot of money in the bank.
You just need practice.
Tell me what should be done.
Who do you think made that mistake?
I persuaded Tom to go to Boston.
Do you think Tom will forgive me?
I'd prefer not to go to Boston.
Do that tomorrow.
I would like to leave this town and never come back.
Tom didn't pick up the phone.
This morning I got up earlier than usual.
I brought some dessert.
Wait till the chairman recognizes you.
Is he a doctor or a patient?
Tom and Mary rearranged the furniture in their living room.
Are you sure you don't want to swim with us?
Tom will never change.
I'm not ashamed that I'm poor.
Tom is in the garden pulling weeds.
It's in my jacket pocket.
He missed the train by one minute.
I'm worried.
Do you have some kind of hobby?
I don't want you to hurt yourself again.
Tom bought himself a dog.
Tom's dreaming.
He got angry with us.
The goods will be delivered free of charge.
That wasn't the only problem.
I think Tom told you the truth.
Mom was busy with her sewing.
Can you tell me what you're talking about?
We've got to find a doctor.
We talked to everyone.
I worry about him.
I promise that I'll read this book.
I'm glad that you're glad.
Tom doesn't like butter.
Please take your seat.
Tom was very naughty.
Can't they speak French?
Answer me.
Let's drink some wine.
Someone will do that job.
Where can I buy tickets?
It's in the closet.
Can you recommend a hotel near the airport?
I can kill you.
I just don't want you to do something you'll be sorry for.
Tom shook his head.
Tom hasn't talked to me for three days.
You've done all you can.
I'm thirty.
What was inside?
She felt like dancing.
This baby is 3 weeks old.
Building materials are expensive now.
Let's go to your room.
Let's take a 10-minute break.
I like Australia.
Tom thought it was totally normal.
Is Tom going to be here?
Please put your bag under your seat.
I'll keep my lips sealed.
I won the election.
Tom lost seventy pounds.
You have to see them.
That dog's bark wouldn't even scare off a baby.
I don't like it when people yell at me.
How big is your dog?
"Some people like summer, and others like winter."
How far is it from here?
Is that what you really wish?
They need to talk.
You should go see a dentist.
I'm in charge until Tom gets here.
Why is Tom good at French?
I did what Tom told me to do.
"What would you do, if you were me?"
I've already begun.
You have the right to know.
I'm glad you're having a good time.
I'll never work for Tom.
I've decided to give up.
They're working upstairs.
I went for a walk in the park.
I know that you've been waiting for this.
I shouldn't have done this.
You can't give me orders.
A dog's sense of smell is much keener than a human's.
It belonged to Tom.
This book was first published in 1877.
Do your parents let you eat candy?
Tom and Mary bought a car for their son.
This is Tom's bag.
Did Tom ask you to do it?
"I'm sorry, but I am against this project."
He helped me carry the chair.
Tom only managed to save a little money.
Those are the most expensive shoes I've ever seen.
The picture was painted by Picasso.
I want to be rich.
Tom isn't very hardworking.
We know we're capable of that.
Tom will be very upset.
Tom doesn't like having to admit that he can't read.
I told you not to sing.
Are you vegetarian?
We got lied to.
When did you arrive?
Why didn't you wait for us?
Only a miracle can save us now.
Tom is a bit shorter than Mary.
He has seven sons.
I wanted to show Tom how good I was at skating.
I didn't know why Tom left.
I get along well with her.
"Tom knew where his keys should've been, but they weren't there."
Did I miss something?
Did you read the book I gave you?
Tom doesn't know you're here.
Life is very short.
Would you lend me your pen?
Don't shoot Tom.
Tom may die.
I was starting to worry.
She doesn't have to go to school on Saturday.
She didn't like him.
Where can we find you?
He isn't much of a teacher.
"Tom, why would anybody be looking for you?"
I can fix it.
Tom remarried after his wife's death.
It's in the kitchen.
I filled in the blanks.
I stay up late every night.
Did you touch anything?
Yoga can improve your posture.
Tom is the one who gave me this apple.
I'm not accustomed to being in the limelight.
Wait for me downstairs.
Tom didn't want to leave.
I need to be there by 2:30.
I'm not that naïve.
I don't want you to go.
I don't think Tom knows whether Mary is busy or not.
"Even though I know a little French, I think we should speak in English."
Where are you going?
Can you believe this?
How do you know the door was locked?
Everything comes at a price.
I eat cheese.
The hail harmed the crops.
I ran into Tom in Boston last week.
Ask Tom where he parked his car.
Go away before they see you here.
This can't be eaten.
Your French has improved a lot.
Tom is sure that everyone saw him.
We did it.
Tom used up all the hot water.
I walked as far as the station.
I am not a monster.
I like the same things you do.
What could it all mean?
It had nothing to do with you.
A nurse wears white.
We aren't complaining.
That'll be very easy to do.
My parents should be proud of me.
"Don't worry, I'm going to help you."
"If a man had 11 sheep and all but 9 died, how many sheep would he have left?"
You're very open.
You can't give Tom that.
I didn't ask you to come with us.
I got some money from a cash machine.
How long have you known him?
I told you Tom looked like John.
I'm a surfer.
Ask them to come.
I do think there's hope.
Were you scared?
That store sells men's wear.
I think this is the best meal I've ever eaten.
Tom knows that I don't like him.
Tom said his feet were cold.
That's a great idea!
The police say Tom wasn't armed.
I don't need it.
That's what we've been told.
I haven't told Tom who helped me.
I felt a little hungry.
I betrayed Tom.
That doesn't work at all.
He lost his balance and fell down.
He started to go to bed early.
Tom seldom makes mistakes when writing in French.
This is very expensive.
I have an appointment.
Tom's dream is to live in a small town in the south of France.
Tom is an able cricket player.
"Suddenly, there were gunshots."
I feel very sorry for him.
The door is closed.
I'm sure it was a coincidence.
I think we need to find a new babysitter.
Make sure you don't forget to fill up the tank.
We're doing it together.
Tom wasn't a thief.
Tom opened the window to get some fresh air.
Do you think that Tom will see me?
No one has an explanation.
He has lost faith in the doctor.
You're nothing special.
Our allies are weak.
Everything was supposed to change.
Is the supermarket still open?
You can talk to Tom.
You're supposed to be relaxing.
Don't you know the rules?
Tom said that you liked baseball.
Tom and Mary had their old house torn down.
Tom gave me a bicycle for my birthday.
We were both a bit drunk.
He had just arrived.
How long does it take to get to the zoo by taxi?
You're the reason I stayed here so long.
The Catholic Bible contains everything in the Protestant Bible plus several other books.
I think you were wrong.
"Tom should've asked Mary for help, but he didn't."
I didn't kill Tom.
I wish I hadn't permitted Tom to do that.
"If Tom comes, please tell me."
Tom will let Mary decide.
I have lots of questions I want to ask Tom.
Maybe you were wrong.
You're polite.
I need your car.
I was going to go.
We forgive you.
I'm going to give the dog a bath.
Tom isn't here because he's in Boston at a conference.
That's Tom's family.
That doesn't seem right to me.
Getting a tattoo is a stupid idea.
Do I have to pay you back?
We don't have enough money for a taxi.
Your security guard wouldn't let me in.
Tom wasn't too happy about that.
It's very rare for that to happen.
"I don't have a CD player, but I bought the CD anyway."
Why is French so difficult?
The sky was blue.
What made you sad?
I will become angry.
"Thanks to your stupidity, we lost the game."
We accept credit cards.
Tom accepted Mary's gift.
Is this your letter?
Why should Tom apologize?
I haven't been there in years.
Will you have a talk with Tom?
Tom was wearing a neck brace.
"You're going to leave for London next Sunday, aren't you?"
I have a friend who cuts his own hair.
Where's your dog?
I think I heard something.
Don't say it again.
It's what we expected.
You're doing wonderful work here.
I'm on my break.
I just started crying.
I did that three months ago.
This rule has no exceptions.
Your phone's ringing.
Tom read it over and over.
Why were you talking to Tom?
He was covered with bruises.
"What does not kill me, makes me stronger."
We're in the middle of a delicate situation.
Burn this letter after you finish reading it.
I have no idea where we are.
We understand you perfectly.
Let's be tolerant.
Didn't you know Tom had a house on Park Street?
It's outdated.
I think I'm not aggressive enough.
I don't know which one I should buy.
I spent no more than three dollars.
The pond dried up in hot weather.
There were 30 survivors.
I'll prepare some food.
I am not too tired.
I don't think that it works that way.
I knew we were all right.
I'm glad you asked that.
Please give me back my pen.
How come I haven't seen you here before?
He carried the box upstairs.
I was just reading.
Tom is currently married to Mary.
May I go buy some ice cream?
Maybe it was just a coincidence.
Tom told me he was doing that.
You'll go to school tomorrow.
Tom is still just a child.
We talked about lots of things.
Tom liked the movie a lot.
I'm the bad one.
I need help.
Why should I trust you?
What on earth is it?
I didn't do that just for you.
I did some shopping.
Can I talk to you?
Tom said that it was an accident.
Allow me to go with you.
Tom has more books than he can read.
Your memory isn't too good.
Take your seats.
I'm exhausted after that long trip.
We accomplished everything we wanted to.
You're very nice.
We saw many ships in the harbor.
Tell us what you saw.
You're the first.
Tom noticed the door wasn't locked.
I want to know all about you.
Tom doesn't go to school.
I don't even want to think about that.
Find me a glass.
Do men and women think differently?
"Tom is getting on your nerves, isn't he?"
"Can I drive, please?"
I just want to talk with you a little while.
We're not going to do that right now.
I'm glad I wasn't the one who had to do that.
It's just an expression.
I didn't get paid as much as I expected.
He speaks English.
Tom is Mary's stepson.
I just finished reading the book.
You look like you're sad.
There was a limousine waiting for Tom outside the hotel.
What are your plans?
We're going to miss you a lot.
Did you get any sleep?
Tom can take a break.
I should've never trusted Tom.
"He paid 1,000 yen for this book."
I think it can be done.
I think Tom really deserves it.
Tom tried to prevent Mary from going to the police.
I don't understand them.
What's that have to do with me?
Don't forget to extinguish your cigarette.
Tom lost seventy pounds.
I wanted to speak to you about this.
I'll meet you at the usual place.
Do you have a knife?
Please write down what I am going to say.
Tom isn't as young as we are.
Tom just wants your attention.
You'll miss Tom and me.
Tom went upstairs.
They want to talk about religion.
I think I know you.
I'm afraid I can't do that.
I began to doubt the accuracy of his statement.
Soldiers are used to danger.
Don't forget to return the book to the library.
"Who can speak French better, Tom or Mary?"
Examine it.
It's empty.
Where's your dad?
Please make a milkshake for me.
I think I'm crazy.
How about you?
I have something to discuss with you.
Is Tom still in school?
His brother studies very hard.
I'm not the one who wrote this letter.
I'm in dire need of money.
Eat your soup while it's warm.
Tom will need your help.
That's their problem.
Tom got into the car and slammed the door shut.
I don't want to see anyone today.
Tom will come to save us.
She has very nice-looking handwriting.
Tom looks very sad.
There's not enough food for all of us.
I'm glad we understand each other.
"Listen, I need to see you."
This coffee tastes bitter.
Tom is able to drive a car.
Something's burning.
Tom doesn't think he can do that by himself.
We've got a pool.
He lived a hard life.
She is Canadian.
Don't get sidetracked.
Who does Tom know?
It won't open.
I don't know how to ski.
Does that frighten you?
Did you see his face?
I hope nobody goes home hungry.
I can't think about this now.
"Well, what do you want to do?"
"Thanks to you, I arrived on time."
Who doesn't want to be a millionaire?
We can't allow Tom to win.
Tom sang very well.
I have something I need to talk to you about.
She poured the milk into a bowl.
It's been a terrible day.
You have to pay in advance.
I fully understand your feelings.
Tom is the one who should be apologizing.
Tom told me you studied French.
Tell me how it works.
Do you want to play tennis?
Do you want to know why?
I see you're busy.
Love is immortal.
This painting is by a local artist.
I wonder when Tom will be home.
I will shoot him.
Tom won't be back tomorrow.
"My father is 48, but he looks young for his age."
Do you have time?
Tom is very likely to know what to do.
Tom was born in 2013.
Come with us.
His hat looked very funny.
Tom has already sold his car.
It was your idea.
I can't hide out forever.
Let me hold it.
Tom told Mary that John would win.
Where do you usually eat lunch?
Please tell me what you'll do.
You should marry Tom.
I called Tom from Boston.
They've taken Tom home.
Construction should start in October.
Tom wished Mary good luck.
Tom doesn't get up as early as I do.
I don't think Tom understands what's going on.
What does this smell like?
Tom's backpack is near the door.
I won!
Each member has to pay a membership fee.
"Well, it'll do for the time being."
Do you even know what that is?
No Canadians were injured.
He did not buy it after all.
I am very hungry.
I can't blame Tom for that.
Where are you staying?
I heard you tell Tom not to sing.
Somebody is following me.
Tom knows the situation better than I do.
Did you stop at the red light?
I don't think that anyone would do that.
Maybe we should wait.
The dog stopped barking.
We're nervous.
When do you start work?
I feel that something is going to happen really soon.
There was a lot of snow last winter.
You can't make me do that.
A prisoner escaped from the prison.
Tom and Mary are playing cards in the next room.
Planes are expensive.
I went for a walk.
I'm doing all I can.
I know why you gave Tom so much money.
Are you telling me the truth?
Do you have mobile phones?
I wasn't about to do that.
I thought you'd be grateful.
You can't help Tom.
I've been looking for you.
"I not only borrowed money from Tom, but also from his wife."
Children often wet their beds at night.
Why did you open the door?
Tom should be here by the end of the day.
They named the dog Cookie.
I often wear sunglasses.
I don't know anybody by that name.
We both want to do that.
He found me a taxi.
I think Tom's doing a good job.
"Tom loved to sing, but nobody wanted to listen to his singing."
We're going to miss you a lot.
They're doing OK.
You won't be able to talk Tom into helping you.
I know your secret.
What's over there?
I don't like myself.
I won't hurt you.
How many people do you think die from cancer every year?
It is going to rain soon.
Don't I know you?
Tom thought that Mary was wasting her time studying French.
Is it already open?
She advised him not to eat too much.
Do you think I'm crazy?
There's something else I want to show you.
You're cute.
Tom is moving to Boston this summer.
I've been looking forward to visiting Boston.
I don't think Tom has time to talk to you.
Tom got expelled from school.
The police will put you behind bars.
I'm stuck in my job.
I don't blame you.
You don't need to wrap it.
His bravery is worthy of praise.
The news of his death spread.
Enter the room.
Tom is fairly pretentious.
There are seven men and four women in my section.
Get your paws off me.
I'd like you to meet my wife.
We can depend on Tom.
He didn't shed a tear.
I'm glad to be home.
What would you have done?
Tom told me it was over.
You're a wise man.
Fish live in the sea.
One for all and all for one.
Tom told me you'd died.
"I thought that Tom would apologize to Mary, but he didn't."
Do you think I like this?
I was talking about you.
Tom was rejected.
You'll be very happy here.
Did you lose your car keys?
Where are we supposed to sit?
See for yourself.
Tom started working here in October.
Tom isn't here. He's already left.
Who died and made you king?
Tom said that he agreed to do that.
He denied having met her last week.
He likes geography and history.
Mary is the prettiest woman I know.
You'd do the same thing.
Do you want a puppy?
I'm genuinely happy for Tom.
You can't know that for sure.
When will you get married?
It was you that suggested seeing that movie.
I thought Tom was afraid.
Tom said that he was going to marry Mary.
What's the text about?
"Since he was very drunk, he couldn't drive his car home."
"Which is your book, this one or that one?"
Tom wasn't sure Mary should do that.
Tom says that he's seen a ghost.
Why don't you want to tell us the truth?
Tom should go help Mary.
I was unaware of the problem.
I didn't know you sang professionally.
He doesn't understand sarcasm.
Not everybody wants to be an artist.
Can you describe it?
It's been an amazing experience.
I wasn't really certain of that.
"I want to leave, but I can't."
I agree with them that we should try again.
She wants you to learn how to read.
Why did I trust you?
Tom said he'd call you.
He stuck to his promise.
Tom saw Mary walking towards her car.
"Are you retired, Tom?"
She needs to be more careful.
I've got some work to do.
Tom behaved like a child.
"Weather permitting, we will leave in an hour."
Tom cut through the parking lot.
I suppose it's time to go.
Tom could tell that Mary was jealous.
Tom denies everything.
I'd like to help Tom prove it.
You shouldn't have eaten so much ice cream.
I've lost my appetite.
She is on a diet.
We don't make mistakes.
God bless America.
You're wealthy.
Tom lives on the floor above me.
We're planning to go to Australia for our honeymoon.
I just joined the team yesterday.
I wasn't at the meeting last week because I was in Boston.
Does that mean you bought it?
Tom was wearing a strange hat.
What color will you paint the kitchen?
Don't drink the water.
I suspect Tom will be back soon.
Why didn't you call somebody?
Thanks for telling me what needed to be done.
We know you didn't kill Tom.
I was glad to see my old friends.
I find that life in the country is pleasant.
She came home very late.
You've failed.
I wanted to see results.
I think you'll be surprised.
May I eat this orange?
She wanted to get a divorce.
"I ought to go there, but I won't."
I'll go myself.
He cut down a tree in the garden.
Tom can do it all.
Tom isn't traveling alone.
Tom really likes his new job.
I have a lot in common with Tom.
I think Tom knows French.
We should be in a position to help you.
He is getting better day by day.
I feel much better.
I'm going to school.
Tom did that because I told him to.
That really does happen sometimes.
Here's the address.
Tom is swimming with his kids in the pool.
How many soldiers did you see?
Tom applied for a visa.
She hardly ate anything.
Why doesn't Tom want to talk with Mary?
I don't think that Tom knows whether Mary is busy or not.
I don't know what I want to do.
Why was Tom left there alone?
Tom and Mary are frightened.
Tom is an ambitious young man.
I'm lonely without you.
You could've told me earlier.
Do you still believe I killed my brother?
I'm sure Tom will be home soon.
Tom is an animal.
I cry every time I listen to this song.
Can you wait?
Tom sacrificed his life to save his brother.
She used to play basketball.
I often hear her play the piano.
I almost went to Boston instead of Chicago.
I'm sorry that I couldn't go with you.
I'm not sure that'll happen.
Are you wearing shoes?
It looks like Tom is jealous.
Tom decided to break up with Mary.
Tom said that he'd go to Boston.
You're not the first person to tell me that.
It's about to explode!
I'm eating ice cream.
Have you finished packing yet?
I knew Tom was a bit crazy.
Are you flirting with me?
Time's on my side.
We loved Tom.
We haven't had any problems yet.
He followed my advice.
Are you okay?
Tom says he's good at cooking.
Tom and Mary are good people.
Can I give you a hug?
Who asked you to sing?
I didn't think you'd be so angry.
Don't worry. I've done this a thousand times.
Why don't you just let me go?
I saw a spider walking on the ceiling.
Please tell me you're joking.
Tom found a dead jellyfish on the beach.
"As a citizen of the world, I know ways of overcoming cultural barriers."
Tom can't tie a tie.
I won't let anything happen to you.
I know only this.
How old is the building?
Take that one.
They are demanding shorter working hours.
I'm not even going to try to do that.
Don't be so sensitive.
I found this note on my door.
We made you a cake.
The children sat cross-legged around the fire.
I've seen all your movies.
Please open the door for me.
Can we rent a car?
It looks like I'm not needed here.
Didn't you do that?
I know I've helped you.
Now it is my turn to speak.
Are you sure?
"If you want to, call me this afternoon."
We're going to need a little more time.
Same-sex couples should be able to get married.
I think I left the water running.
I don't feel like waiting.
I haven't spoken with Tom since that happened.
The boy has an apple in his pocket.
I had entirely forgotten about that.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I know that you won't do it.
Tom is designing his first building.
How did Tom know where Mary lived?
I can't reach that can of tomatoes.
Nuclear power is safe.
You should get to bed early tonight.
Just tell me who's next.
Why are you so busy all the time?
I miss my wife.
I wear my old coat in weather like this.
Tom poured a cup of tea for Mary.
You're probably hungry.
I think that you're wrong.
"When Tom was eighteen, he decided that he wanted to become a soldier."
Don't climb up the wall.
Tom opened the bottle for Mary.
It was a nice break.
I always walk home.
I'm tired of being your slave.
What else did you want?
Do you know anything about cameras?
"We'll never know, will we?"
If only I'd known then what I know now.
He walked quietly.
It's not a fish.
Raise your left hand.
"Someone put it there, but I don't know who."
I heard that Tom won the spelling bee.
"Be careful with that, Tom."
He's not my father.
Tom didn't know whether he was right or wrong.
It's an old custom.
Tom runs fast.
You didn't even try.
I don't think I would do that.
I think he's happy.
I couldn't live like that.
Tom was famous.
Look at that big dog.
The cat is in the box.
Tom doesn't think Mary is jealous.
Apparently no one noticed.
Tom adjusted the mirrors.
Tom has denied the allegation.
I'm turning thirty this October.
I have to say I envy you.
We are hungry.
"Tom can come, too, if he wants."
The book consists of thirty chapters.
What are you doing this for?
Tom told me the bridge was unsafe.
This plan will be very expensive to carry out.
Has Tom been informed of this?
This is a decent town.
I promise that I won't bite.
"While I was reading, I fell asleep."
I wanted Tom to clean his room.
I wanted you to be the first to know.
The streets are deserted.
The value of the coins depended on the weight of the metal used.
Tom isn't alive.
Go make me a sandwich.
I had my only son die of cancer.
Everyone wants to be liked.
Tom struggled to express how he felt.
Tom is one of the wealthiest people in the world.
The cold weather has turned the leaves red.
What's your favorite joke?
You look like you're satisfied.
I don't think that it was an accident.
We don't have a landline anymore.
It's really beautiful.
Maybe what Tom said was true.
I clean my room almost every day.
I don't know my IQ.
Tom pleaded guilty to grand larceny.
Tom wasn't expecting to see you.
Thirteen homes have been destroyed.
Do little things matter?
Tom will lose everything.
My hands were dirty.
His life is hanging by a thread.
Tom said he was wounded.
No one smiled.
I went back home.
We will leave in an hour.
I need some tea.
Tell me who you are.
I'm an old friend.
Let's eat.
May God's will be done.
Moonlight was the only illumination.
I'm still waiting for your answer.
There's someone outside.
I'm turning thirty soon.
I didn't know he drank so much.
I think I'll go to bed.
Someone famous said that imagination is more important than intelligence.
I didn't expect that to come from you.
I'll have to do that alone.
I heard you and Tom talking.
It means too much to me.
I have bad news for you.
Can I use your pencil?
Tom didn't buy anything for Mary.
I can't eat.
They have to clean the room.
My life would be meaningless without you.
We should've done this earlier.
"Tom is an honest boy, so he doesn't tell lies."
He left his son a fortune.
Tom found Mary sitting on a bench in the park.
I don't like them.
Do I really have to give a speech?
Where have you been lately?
No one's died yet.
What are you and Tom up to?
"Let's go home, Tom."
Tom worked.
Mother is making tea for us.
What do you want with Tom?
Tom cannot drive a car.
Thanks for returning my call.
Tom loves this place.
I'm athletic.
The button on your coat is coming off.
We all thought that Tom had escaped.
I didn't do very well on today's exam.
This is the best dictionary we sell.
"With a bit of good will on both sides, our problems should be able to be resolved."
Where's your baggage?
Let's analyze the facts.
What are you learning?
You should be ashamed.
That was embarrassing.
The color is purple rather than pink.
I don't think Tom has to go there by himself.
That's why I worry about you.
Have you ever read the Bible?
We're going out tonight.
She acknowledged having made a mistake.
Tell Tom it was a mistake.
I've promised Tom I wouldn't do that anymore.
Tom got stung by a jellyfish.
I don't know how I can help you.
I have some advice for you.
You deserve that.
"Excuse me, what are you doing?"
Let's go by bus to see more of the city.
President Lincoln was what we call a self-made man.
You made the same mistake as last time.
Tom was at Mary's house yesterday.
Tom didn't talk.
I don't know if Tom remembers me.
Tom will be disappointed if you don't go to his party.
I'm not a fanatic.
Is that why you've stayed?
I can't let you risk it.
I don't think Tom will swim.
Watch how I do it.
Tom went back to Boston.
The conference wraps up tomorrow.
I'm simply doing my job.
We're sure of Tom's honesty.
Would you like to sing?
I know who you want to talk to.
I know that Tom wants to see you.
I didn't know that Tom knew French.
How will you do that?
I'm a fast learner.
"Well, I must be going."
You could do better.
It took Tom almost three hours to finish his homework.
I am going to get dressed.
He worked hard.
How many apples are left?
Tom is the one who built this house.
I didn't go.
I'd like to kiss you.
I don't know who won.
This tree is more than a hundred years old.
I know everything I need is here.
Let's think about it.
Don't look at it.
Tom told me where you hid the gold coins.
No one could tell me why that happened.
I know how important it is.
Did you clean your room today?
I've come to apologize.
I'm starting to get tired.
It's very sticky.
Nobody's asking you for money.
I've waited so long.
Tom underestimated me.
I have to stop them.
Tom is extremely outspoken.
Yellow fever and smallpox were no longer a threat.
I know where Tom will be three hours from now.
I passed all my exams.
It was a warm summer evening.
Go back to the lab.
Living here isn't easy.
He asked her if she knew him.
Tom won't be able to finish the job unless we help him.
Tom dances very well.
I'm interested in music.
What do you want?
I'm doing this to help you.
Does Tom have a license?
There must be an easier way to do that.
Pick him up.
I know you're happy.
We must finish our homework first.
Don't worry. It's OK.
Are you certain that's what you want?
Sorry for calling you so early.
Would you please let go of my arm?
Tom has told me so much about you.
I want to get married and I want to have kids.
I was very disoriented.
Tom put the children to bed.
Do you stay at Tom's when you're in Boston?
A temporary government was established.
That rings a bell.
Tom wanted to buy Mary a new scarf.
It's 8:30.
You don't keep your promises.
What was the cause of the fire?
We were moved to tears.
I can follow the rules.
I woke up early.
You paid more than you should've.
I'm talking about you.
"Excuse me, but I believe you're mistaken."
Lie on your left side.
Tom couldn't control himself.
I was ready.
I don't see what we can do.
Do you have a piano?
I'm poor.
I'm afraid that I don't know what you're talking about.
I have nothing to worry about.
I swim in the summer.
I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.
I hope you'll wait for us.
"I wasn't very hungry, so I decided to eat later."
Tom isn't good at remembering names.
They're free to go.
You're wanted on the phone. It's from Tom.
Tom was sitting in the dark.
What's the name of that bird?
Tom can't hold his liquor.
I doubt that you are as busy as you say you are.
Tom didn't even notice Mary was looking at him.
I have a hunch that it will rain.
Try it on.
I'll be in my room.
I suspect that Tom doesn't have to do that anymore.
Tom plans to break up with his girlfriend.
Don't worry. It's perfectly safe.
How old is your cat?
Did Tom know what to do?
"His work finished, he left for home."
It wouldn't matter.
I think it's time for me to return to Australia.
Tom appreciates good wine.
"Even though I'm tired, I'll study hard."
We don't want anything from you.
Find Tom and kill him.
Did you walk to school yesterday?
Why didn't you come into work yesterday?
Tell me what's the matter.
You gave me only fifty cents.
He was late because of the snow.
It reminds me of you.
Can we ask you a few questions?
I hope you'll be comfortable here.
Aren't you going to help us?
Why did Tom want Mary to leave?
He wanted to meet you.
I don't think Tom knows whether Mary can do that or not.
May I go out for a walk?
Tom visited not only Boston but also Chicago.
It is becoming warmer day by day.
I don't know what Tom told Mary.
I wasn't too nervous.
He came to ask us to help him.
I expected more from you.
They rejected all our plans.
There must be a connection between these murders.
You need to learn to listen to our advice.
Try to stay awake.
Tom quickly became very famous.
Don't make me cry.
Leave my stuff alone.
Don't you ever clean your room?
I heard they caught Tom.
That's Saturn.
Guess what happened.
Why are you up so early?
I'm on the roof.
The system isn't flawless.
Tom retired in 2013 and died three years later.
Maybe it's Tom.
The roof leaks every time it rains.
Don't you see what you're doing?
Does your house have a basement?
I put the meat we just bought in the freezer.
Do you have a lot of money?
You need to eat if you want to get strong.
Tom doesn't go to Boston very often.
Tom doesn't need to worry about that.
We don't know that yet.
What's on the table?
I think I lost my keys.
You can sit wherever you want.
I'm not going to lose.
Tom opened his window.
These chairs are made from wood.
We've got to take Tom to the doctor.
The star of the show was Tom.
I told Tom to wait for me in the lobby.
Where's my phone book?
"Two ice creams, please."
There are still people who believe that the earth is flat.
I know you're angry.
Tell Tom to call me back.
We have to find out where Tom lives.
Let's take the subway.
She has a tattoo of a lizard on her thigh.
Tom knew where Mary wanted to go.
Is that why you came?
It's what we deserve.
Is Tom able to swim?
Do you know anybody there?
Tom hasn't been doing what he's supposed to be doing.
Thank you for your invitation.
We'll be working on that this week.
My father cannot go without coffee even for a day.
Tom has three weeks of paid vacation.
I can't do it alone. I need your help.
I don't drink.
You can leave now.
Your book is here.
I've never felt this good before.
Tom will never go back there.
That was what I wanted you to think.
Tom didn't disappoint us.
You should not depend on your parents.
I eat with my hands.
Tom asked me if I'd lend him my car.
Tom told me about the earthquake.
Nowadays his father goes to work by car.
Go and help Tom.
Tom admitted that he was curious.
I didn't know you could do that.
He acted like a saint.
I have two brothers and one sister.
Tom was holding something in his right hand.
The sky was dark.
Don't worry. Everything's going to be all right.
I have just what you need.
Tom doesn't understand French.
Tom saw nothing.
It was necessary.
Where am I going to sleep?
How much beer should I buy?
Tom didn't play basketball with us.
I know that that's not true.
I'm sorry I couldn't help you.
Tom laughed and Mary smiled.
I put the book on the table.
Tom spoke perfect French.
Go find something else to do.
Tom did that the way you suggested.
There was a bridge across each river.
We're responsible.
Would you try this on?
I wish I had as much money as Tom does.
It was Tom who washed your car.
He is as nutty as a fruitcake.
Half the apples Tom gave me were rotten.
Tom didn't want to talk about what had happened.
I need to tell Tom something.
I was outraged.
We kept in touch.
Who ate all the cheese?
I know you still blame Tom for Mary's death.
She takes part in many school activities.
She stood up.
I didn't know he liked me.
Didn't you know that Tom wasn't planning to do that?
Let's pretend we're happy together.
Tom knows the rules.
I sleep a lot.
Tom carried two boxes into the storage room.
I've never been to your house.
Would you mind taking a picture of us?
"Can you explain it, Tom?"
Do you think that he will pass the examination?
Tom will protect you.
Who are we competing against?
Don't you like my cooking?
I haven't written Tom back.
I think my jeans have shrunk.
I got bored and left early.
He tried to write down everything the teacher said.
Leave Tom alone.
Won't you have another piece of cake?
Everyone likes you.
Do you know why Tom is crying?
Tom has lived alone ever since his wife died.
I talked to her.
Keep it a secret.
Are you busy tomorrow afternoon?
Why is Tom absent?
What was the music you were listening to?
I'll fire you.
I know you lied to Tom.
You can't understand.
You're always laughing.
"Can I have a beer, please?"
I was at home almost all day.
I get bored quickly in everything I do.
Don't you ever sleep?
I got divorced.
Tom was more than happy.
Your phone is ringing.
I've decided to stay where I am.
There is no room for romance in my life.
I love being with Tom.
There is a bench under the tree.
We cultivate rice.
How many children does Tom have?
So what happened?
I found Tom there.
Tom's part of the work isn't finished.
I waited for him till ten.
I hate her parents.
We're here because of you.
This is the only tie I have.
I saw an old friend of mine.
This is why I came here.
I knew Tom better than you did.
Tom and Mary have known each other since 2013.
Tom is undressing.
He'll be here around four o'clock.
I've been to Boston many times.
Her work was going smoothly.
I studied Chinese at the University of Venice.
Tom doesn't want to live here anymore.
Has Tom been arrested?
I wish I had known.
Do you miss Boston?
I want a puppy for Christmas.
I don't know exactly how long we waited.
The guests are in the living room.
Half of them are students.
Don't be so harsh on yourself.
There's no time for that.
Why didn't you tell Tom the truth?
Do you need to go?
What do you think is in that box?
We have known each other for years.
My parents wouldn't understand.
Don't use your real name.
I'd like a room facing the garden.
Is it poisonous?
You're always complaining.
I have never read such a scary novel.
"You can take a horse to water, but you can't make him drink."
Tom drank the rest of what was in the bottle.
How much is the ticket?
Tom insisted that I do that.
Do you think I should apologize to Tom?
Water was dripping from the tap.
We absolutely have to go.
She spent her life in pursuit of the truth.
Tell Tom to be here by 2:30.
I mistook you for your brother.
Your watch seems to be very valuable.
Tom and Mary have a son named John.
Tom promised to return.
Tom didn't have the courage to pull the trigger.
I told Tom I'd changed my mind.
Tom was a bartender.
Was it you who ate the last donut?
You will miss the train.
Tom brought Mary some water.
Tom believes that's correct.
I see your point.
My favorite subject is biology.
These goods are in great demand.
Do you remember everything?
Watch what you're doing!
I'm supporting you.
You look pale. What's the matter with you?
Are you happy?
How can you stand the noise?
Tom can barely breathe.
Are you sure you don't want to wait for Tom?
Tom thought he could win.
The ice was thick enough to walk on.
I have to leave immediately.
How do I get to the beach?
Tom slapped Mary.
That's why I didn't tell you.
You can ask Tom for help.
He cannot have said so.
None of you should leave this room.
We only have half a tank of gas left.
I have doubts about that.
I know someone's here.
Everybody knows that they like each other.
Can I borrow your car tonight?
Don't come dressed like bums.
Did they do something to Tom?
"The fire, driven by an east wind, destroyed the center of the city."
Tom does that better than me.
That's what I wanted to ask.
I'm no longer afraid of dogs.
This wasn't that expensive.
Things are changing fast.
I am forty-five years old.
It's all I know.
We must do something to stop this madness.
What's the matter?
He pinched and scraped for many years to save money.
Tom tried to escape.
I knew it could happen.
I admit my mistake.
Ask Tom to stay a while.
You're so stupid.
He is wearing sunglasses.
"One for all, and all for one, this is our motto."
Tom and Mary are still married.
Don't be cruel.
Tom could've been one of us.
I feel tired and exhausted.
Who did you learn French from?
Tom died of heart failure on October twentieth at the age of 93.
She spoke for 30 minutes without a break.
Tom wanted to see his children.
Tom's father died before he was born.
Tom is usually on time and Mary is usually late.
Tom has talent.
Tom claims that he can speak French.
Tell me what you wrote.
There are rare animals in Australia.
Does Tom know why?
I saw Tom staring at Mary's legs.
Do you think it's going to rain tomorrow?
Tom was at home the whole day.
Don't you know his name?
The arrow missed its target.
Tom would've helped us.
Don't you know the rules?
She's my godmother.
Tom doesn't like Australia very much.
What should they do in this situation?
This is so unlike you.
Everyone started crying again.
I spend too much time in front of my computer.
"Judging from his appearance, he must be a rich man."
Tom said he'll talk to Mary.
I'll see you on Monday in Boston.
She made him clean his room.
The person standing near the gate is Tom.
We take nothing for granted.
I need to find my pen.
"I'm looking for work, too."
The heat kept me awake all night.
I didn't know that you had so many cats.
She is very much like her mother.
Tell her that I am listening to music.
People like to talk to you.
I've given you everything you've asked for.
Tom phoned his lawyer.
I want to deposit some money.
That explains everything.
I overslept this morning.
I've been studying French for a very long time.
What were you doing in my room?
Where did that happen?
How well off is Tom?
I'm here if you need anything.
He showed us a beautiful hat.
I'd never do that.
I thought Tom would come soon.
Never lose hope.
My knee hurts a lot.
How can I know if a girl likes me?
Where are you sitting?
I broke the window.
Tom needs to comb his hair.
Are you sure you can't help us?
Don't think about it too much.
You look well rested.
Tom died of gastric cancer.
Are you an idiot?
Tom has already gone to school.
"Go back, Tom."
Tom's a typical Englishman.
Who wrote this poem?
I never thought about it before.
My watch keeps good time.
Don't be late.
Tom can't do that alone. I hope Mary can help him.
We understood each other.
I want a pair of gloves.
Thank you for the corrections.
Where are the other three?
Well begun is half done.
I called them.
I told you what Tom said.
Tom won't make it.
Tom said he didn't want me to tell Mary what happened.
Tom did all he could.
The salary of a teacher is lower than that of a lawyer.
The planes arrived one after another.
I have to study for tomorrow's French test.
You have to do it.
I know Tom understands.
They were safe.
He claimed he knew you well.
I have known him since September.
When did the robbery take place?
I'd like to go sledding.
Tom believed he could win.
Let me take your temperature.
I heard someone laughing.
I brought mine.
Do you think Boston is a noisy city?
My father told me where to go.
"If you're happy, I'm happy."
Tom refused to admit that he'd made a mistake.
Tom isn't the one who told me that.
I've never tried.
Let me stay here.
Tom has never seen Mary so angry.
He is considered trustworthy.
I like Chinese food a lot.
"If Tom doesn't want to help, he doesn't have to."
I was at the library.
Let's get a picture of us together.
We import many things from Australia.
I don't think that I should let you drive.
Do you not like them?
Tom said that he hated Mary.
I know it's not difficult.
His absence was due to illness.
Tom wanted to forget about what happened.
Not everything Tom said was true.
Tom says he's tired.
Tom is always smoking.
He must have lost his marbles.
I barely managed to catch the train.
Tom won't buy bread.
I won't be there.
Hard work never hurt anyone.
I'd be glad to help.
The test was easy.
I didn't know you were still studying French.
You're wanted on the phone.
I knew Tom wouldn't like Mary.
My grandfather doesn't know how to take money out of an ATM.
The movie is now showing at a theater near you.
Tom told me that he was adopted.
Many happy returns to all who bear the name of a flower!
I have nothing to do with the case.
I know Tom isn't here.
You're creative.
Help me move this stone.
Did Tom look busy?
Tom wouldn't help us.
She forgave him for losing all her money.
Maybe Tom will apologize to Mary.
Tom got too close to the fire and singed his beard.
"Since the coat Tom tried on was too small, the clerk gave him another one to try on."
The sisters are both blondes.
Tom put the plate of sandwiches on the table in front of Mary.
You can take it.
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
We're a happy family.
She hates green peppers.
Have you forgotten?
Do you know why Tom is absent?
"I had stage fright at first, but I got over it quickly."
Tell Tom that you love him before it's too late.
I don't expect you to forgive me.
Look at this one.
Tom dated Mary for a long time.
Can I ask you something personal?
You're a good girl.
My grandmother is still vigorous at 82 years old.
I need to talk to you now.
I think you can handle it.
Are you thinking about Tom?
Tom doesn't appear to agree.
Are you still angry at Tom?
It has been snowing since this morning.
I'm ready for anything.
Nobody supported her.
I have to tell Tom.
You must go back.
It's the law now.
May I take your coat?
He isn't afraid of death.
Tell Tom I'll do it.
I don't want people to know about that.
"I forgot what the exact price was, but it was about 170 dollars."
I couldn't understand it.
I thought you would come.
It's across the street.
They know what we did.
It is already dark.
I hope you won't mind.
Tom drinks coffee every day.
Have they escaped?
She's wearing sunglasses.
"Did Tom have to do that, too?"
I thought that I was alone.
Where did you look?
I was invited to their wedding.
I dragged the heavy baggage to the airport.
Some people think the president spends too much time traveling.
This is probably Tom's bicycle.
Why did you buy those glasses?
The cost of living in Japan is going down.
I'll explain it next time.
I would die for you.
Why are you building a wall here?
I expect to win.
I'm not as rich as Tom.
You have a handsome son.
Tom is at the computer.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.
Tom is as strong as ever.
We have a lot of fun.
What's your plan for tomorrow?
My impression of the United States is very good.
Has Tom ever talked to you about me?
Please give me a visa.
Why don't you go on a diet?
"I'm sorry, but you're wrong."
I won't tell anyone what you did.
Tom asked me to take a look at it.
I'll have it sent to you.
When are we going to do it?
I will testify.
My dog sleeps next to my bed.
"Tom didn't want to leave, but he did."
It's not up to you.
I don't think that Tom is still asleep.
How many friends do you have in Boston?
I knew something strange was going on.
He called off the trip.
What do you think they were doing?
I've never heard Tom sing in French.
I thought Tom had been told.
I've known that all along.
I need you to tell me what to do.
I took a cold shower.
I was just kidding.
This is a book.
Where was Tom arrested?
What do you think Tom would've done in that situation?
Call the cops.
We have a meeting tomorrow.
Just keep walking.
We don't need money.
This chair is light.
Why don't you just talk to Tom about it?
Tom can't come with us.
Could we go somewhere and talk?
It took us half an hour to set up the tent.
Get ready for bed.
I think Tom is a very strange guy.
Tom wants to feed the birds in the park.
"She seldom, if ever, goes to movies by herself."
Didn't you know that I don't have a driver's license?
That seat is taken.
Tom and Mary sat side by side.
Tom was three when his father died.
I told Tom you'd be able to do that.
I don't want to become an electrician.
I demand the truth.
Tom has won.
"Tom, how old were you when you left Australia?"
Tom would've apologized to Mary if he'd thought it was important.
Is this your daughter?
They were arguing.
It was close to 10 o'clock.
It's not a problem.
What do you have in mind?
I'm going to go back to Boston.
It's been warm the last few days.
Didn't that seem odd to you?
He is out now.
The question is who.
Can't Tom get somebody else to do that?
I like to feel sad. I know that most people try to avoid any kind of sad feeling. But I think that is wrong.
Tom didn't want Mary to cry.
Tom doesn't have enough time to do that today.
I don't think Tom likes baseball.
I think you know that'll be impossible to do.
Are there any Chinese restaurants near here?
"What makes you happy, Tom?"
I think we're looking for different things.
Tom told the police that three men had attacked him.
I don't think prices will go down.
You started it.
Tom looked under the couch.
I want to stay home with my family.
I think you're overweight.
Do you think this is fair?
This has already happened once before.
I couldn't let that happen.
I'm so fat.
This is intolerable.
Everyone got up to leave.
I shouldn't have eaten so much.
Tom knows all the answers.
Tom works six days a week.
Tom said that he would help me.
It is forbidden to throw things out of the window.
Tom doesn't know that Mary is Canadian.
What do you like about it?
He has helped the poor throughout his life.
Will you really come?
We're young.
Do you regret what you did?
She can't tell right from wrong.
They canceled the festival.
You'll get wet.
It'll stop raining soon.
How many employees do you have?
My younger brother is taller than me.
It doesn't mean anything.
Tom is obviously lying.
I'll be able to show you.
Tom is counting on Mary's help.
Tom came to pick me up at the airport.
Tom has already told me what I wanted to know.
Tom said that he was angry.
I want everyone to know I'm not a murderer.
We met before.
It was empty.
I don't love you anymore.
Did you stop at the red light?
Tom said that he didn't have much time left.
I tried the shirt on.
Call me any time you want.
Do you want to know or not?
That man stole my wallet.
You are the only one who can help me.
"Tom didn't need to do that, but he did."
I don't have all that much money with me.
They are in trouble. Can you help them?
It would've been better if you hadn't gone there.
Do you want to get married?
"You crack me up, Tom."
I would like you to trust me.
None of the boys paid any attention to Mary.
I can't ignore that.
I'm going to wait till 2:30.
I can't help you because I'm busy.
He weighs a lot more than before.
All I want is money.
Tom decided to study law.
How long a rope do you need?
Tom forgave you.
"No matter what anyone says, I won't go."
He is sure to succeed.
It isn't a prophecy.
Are you on board?
Buy tofu on your way home.
I can't believe that Tom did that.
I have no intention of doing that.
Can you show me where you live on this map?
I didn't laugh at Tom's jokes.
Ask Tom to attend the meeting.
Can you predict the future?
Tom gets mad very easily.
Tom spent three weeks in the hospital.
I seldom eat breakfast.
Tom needs to be kicked off the team.
Tom bought a present for his daughter's friend.
This is the most comfortable chair I've ever sat in.
Did Tom really hit Mary?
Here is a list of moderately priced restaurants.
I don't envy you.
"I wanted a key to Tom's house, but he wouldn't give me one."
Tom shoved Mary off the pier.
She was fortunate to pass the exam.
Do you recognize these?
What do you do here?
This book isn't mine.
I knew you'd want to sing.
The weather is just right today.
They fell into each other's arms.
I feel very sick.
He is old enough to know better.
My brother is a first-year student.
Tom described what happened in great detail.
I don't want to go to school tomorrow.
He comes to see me nearly every day.
Tom won't have to wait for Mary.
My cat got stuck up a tree.
I don't think this is normal.
This is the house in which they lived when they were children.
Can't you just be nice to each other?
I promise I'll pay you back the money I owe you before the end of the month.
Don't buy your car from that dealership. They'll rob you blind.
Tom got back to Boston yesterday evening.
We'll have to leave without Tom.
Tom said that Mary didn't look well.
You can give me the details later.
I just don't want to talk about it.
Do you still think Tom doesn't know what he's doing?
You can't leave.
Baseball is a team sport.
This story is worth reading again.
He will have to go there.
You could've died.
Won't you come in for a cup of tea?
You're just like me.
It isn't much of a car.
It was pretty easy.
Children always want to become adults.
Tom hurt his shoulder.
I didn't know you believed in ghosts.
Did you speak to Tom yesterday?
I'd like a city map.
Don't give them anything.
How that could've happened is a mystery to me.
I don't think anybody would do that.
Please turn to the right.
Please don't change anything.
Tom said he didn't like the concert at all.
Do you think Tom can win?
Tom snored so loudly I could hear him from my room.
"Nowadays, almost every home has one or two televisions."
Can you speak both French and English?
You should eat slower.
Are Tom and Mary really married?
Tell me what to do and I'll do it.
Her name wasn't on the list.
How did you know I didn't want to go to Boston?
My father doesn't have a car.
Tom put flowers on Mary's grave.
Did Tom say what he was planning to do this evening?
Make it smaller.
Tom came back home tired.
It won't be as easy to do as you think.
We ran after the cat.
You're taller than me.
Aren't we happy together?
I mean no disrespect.
May I have a word with you?
Why do you hate dogs so much?
I have a feeling that she'll come today.
I don't want children.
Has Tom come back already?
He waited for him until 10.
I'm not here for you.
That farm belongs to the Jackson family.
I don't know who you're talking about.
Can't anything be done?
I hope everything goes well.
I don't feel like cooking today.
He saved money for the trip.
The plane is taking off.
Show me how you did that.
Tom did everything he had to do.
You seem very determined.
Who else helped you?
The soldiers opened fire.
A woman fell from a ship into the sea.
Do you want me to leave now?
I want to know why you're doing this.
The hotel's full of foreigners.
"Tom told me how to do it, but it didn't register."
I'm sure Tom's fine.
The weather has been bad for two weeks.
I prefer mineral water.
Tom might go to Australia next Monday.
Tom knew Mary was dying.
I take for granted that my answer is correct.
She buys us shoes.
Mother is in the kitchen.
I'm responsible for Tom's safety.
That's what Tom wants.
He was alone.
I came back to help you.
This sentence is in the present tense.
I heard strange noises coming from his bedroom.
Tom accidentally got on the wrong bus.
"The message was from Tom, not Mary."
Let's have lunch.
Do you think I'm fat?
This didn't work.
I've been lucky.
Tom wasn't surprised that Mary already knew about what had happened.
Tom doesn't need to go.
You all passed the test.
There were lots of happy kids in the swimming pool.
Who made dinner?
Add water to the soup.
Just do what you're told.
I want a bicycle.
You're unpredictable.
You can have both.
Tom has decided to become a pilot.
"Apparently, the murder happened in a locked room."
I don't want to appear ungrateful.
What makes you think I'm rich?
"In the 1960s, folk music was very popular."
I don't know anything about art.
Tom couldn't decode the secret message.
You've lost too much blood.
Tom wasn't able to make us laugh.
Tom had three assistants.
I've got to speak to you.
I'm counting on you.
Tom is unlikely to ever win.
Tom had no idea that Mary hated him so much.
Are you always that busy?
Tom is very responsible.
What kind of flowers do you like?
Give it to them.
Did you have anything to do with this?
I told you I don't know Tom.
What happened to you?
I was tired of the work.
Why is this happening?
We didn't have time to do that.
They plan to do away with most of these regulations.
He gave me his phone number.
Eat something.
"You're afraid to sleep, aren't you?"
Have you called Tom?
Why didn't you tell them?
Tom is ready to start.
Tom doesn't know how Mary died.
Tom said that he didn't want to play tennis with me.
Tom could've warned me.
Money can't buy everything.
What do you see in the picture?
He owes me a lot of money.
I didn't know you could cook this well.
"If Mary slapped Tom, I'm sure he deserved it."
We know you're still there.
Tom barely ate.
We didn't get paid this week.
I'm going with you.
Tell me the details.
Where's my lawyer?
Look there.
I want you to come with us.
Compiling a dictionary demands an enormous amount of time.
You need new shoes.
Tom's design saved the company millions of dollars.
Please wait till I have finished my homework.
You made Tom cry.
Tom shot the injured horse to put it out of its misery.
All the students attended the party.
It expires tomorrow.
Tom was here for three years.
It is rude to talk when your mouth is full.
"How are you today, Tom?"
Have you gone completely insane?
There's always time.
Why is Tom doing this?
We're so lucky to have Tom on our team.
"Apart from a few mistakes, your composition was excellent."
You're really good.
They're staring at you.
We've done everything we can for Tom.
Keep your shirt on.
She is currently in danger.
Who is the architect?
"I can speak Chinese, but I can't read it."
She isn't doing her homework. She's reading a book.
He likes sweet tea.
Isn't Tom handsome?
Tom couldn't decide exactly when he should go to Boston.
"Seen from space, the earth is very beautiful."
The car went around the corner on two wheels.
Is that your son?
They're not my enemies.
I need to lose weight.
Tom and Mary are sleeping.
Tom told me you needed some money.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
What's your phone number?
Who's your favorite singer?
Thaw out the meat before cooking it.
Did you sign this?
I knew Tom would likely do that.
Tom doesn't need to know.
"This computer is yours, isn't it?"
Spring is coming.
There is no need for us to hurry.
I told them to contact us if they needed help.
We like it.
He is a friendly person.
Go back inside.
Tom says he knows how difficult it'll be to do that.
Are you still afraid of the dark?
Tom sings tenor.
Tom left because of you.
My father has a habit of reading the newspaper before breakfast.
You've come too early.
"Against the snow, the white rabbit was invisible."
Is Tom a criminal?
I need a place to sit.
I need to know what you saw that night.
It's warm here.
"When I was a boy, I thought that I wanted to be a doctor."
She shaves her legs.
You deserved better.
What's so special about this?
When was the last time you visited your grandmother?
I wonder what's for dinner.
I'm no slouch on the dance floor.
Why is everyone afraid of Tom?
The wind blew hard.
The girl likes horses.
I could've done that.
Does Tom know my name?
I felt like going out for a walk.
Tom knew who the killer was.
Tom doesn't have the authority to do that.
We're planting seeds.
Tom is going to love Boston.
This report is incomplete.
I think Tom would've done that.
I'd rather die than marry you.
I'm sure you won't have any problems.
What I think doesn't matter.
I face a dilemma.
I had a quarrel with my sister.
I don't think that Mary is pretty.
They know who I am.
Tom was harboring a fugitive.
Tom isn't cold at all.
I'm young.
Tom asked Mary a question in French.
I don't need anything now.
Let me think for a second.
We're a little busy here.
Tom said he had to help Mary.
The elevator is coming up.
Tell Tom I don't know where he parked his car.
We need people like Tom.
Are you tall?
Tom has started wearing a tie to work.
I think you need to call Tom.
I thought you needed it.
Tom said he cried every day.
I don't want that.
I don't want to eat.
I think you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life.
He is wearing gloves.
I can predict how Tom will behave.
They're eating dinner now in the dining room.
"Tom, I'm back."
Tom said we shouldn't do that anymore.
How do you know that I don't have it?
Tom's cellphone rang.
How did they come here?
Please don't call me that.
Tell me where to put these books.
Why did you lie to us?
Do you shave every day?
Are you coming with us?
I've already discussed that with you.
We only see each other on weekends.
Her face was sooty.
Tom complained that he didn't have enough time to read.
Tom hates dancing.
We enjoyed skating.
I brought you some cookies.
Tom lives with his mother.
I didn't know that Tom did that.
My daughter came to see me from time to time.
What did I win?
Can birds smell?
I'm afraid we can't help you.
Don't shoot!
Tom won't tell me who he plans to hire.
Do you want to go there?
They will agree on that.
Stop!
I was fascinated by her performance.
Tom Jackson wasn't his real name.
How much were you paid to do that?
It's not easy raising children.
That was a waste of time.
Never play on the road.
I still haven't decided where to go.
I want popcorn.
I'm glad I can help.
Can Tom really speak French better than Mary?
Tom seems to believe everything Mary says.
Tom turned on the heat.
Tom made Mary wait for a long time.
It made Tom sad.
Tom told me you were on vacation.
Did you buy anything for Tom?
I spent the entire morning filling out these forms.
The number of people suffering from heart disease has increased.
Are you seeing someone else?
Will you play with me tomorrow?
They're attempting to contact her.
We heard screams.
There is an additional problem.
I confess I'm miserable.
We'll do more tests tomorrow.
This day will go down in history.
Are you going anywhere on Monday?
I won't assist you.
They walked toward the bridge.
Parents punish their children for misbehavior.
I miss my mom.
I don't think you're heartless.
I need you to tell me where to go.
It's all wet.
Don't you know Tom?
Why don't you believe me?
Tom has a high-pitched voice.
I'm not ready for a relationship.
They worked jointly on this project.
The clothes Tom wears are made by his mother.
"That's what you do, isn't it?"
I'd like a salad.
The musical was far from being a success.
It took a long time to analyze the data.
I think Tom is courageous.
That always helps.
I have been to the library.
Tell her that I am looking for the keys.
I didn't take your money.
It is fact that he wants to visit Egypt.
Is that really what you think?
"Tom started to speak, but then decided to remain silent."
The snowstorm continued.
Don't you think it's time to get up?
"If you want, you can come along."
I want to get out of here before anyone sees us.
The cake should be done soon.
Tom's reputation is ruined.
I was in school.
The windows in my room are cracked.
Tom believes you.
Everybody cheered.
I can work with anyone.
It's such a shame you're leaving.
Our teacher was late this morning.
Can you help me move the sofa?
Tom never lies to Mary.
Tom said that worried him.
Try on another one.
It's a miracle that you were able to survive.
Don't listen to Tom. He's lying to you.
How do you tell them apart?
Tom is planning on buying a house.
Are you a Canadian citizen?
Jackson sent a message to President Monroe.
He was opposed to monopolies.
His condition could have been worse.
Why didn't you inform me?
My house is close to a bus stop.
Do you think it's going to rain today?
I want some more ice cream.
Tom was forced to resign.
Tom is a really bad cook.
I can't find my plane ticket.
He played golf every day during his vacation.
I have a schedule to keep.
Tom really wanted to win.
What is bullfighting?
I'm just a plain office worker.
Tell Tom that I'm not hungry.
I don't have to put up with this.
Tom needs to know that somebody cares.
Tom asked Mary where she was planning to go.
We followed Tom.
Tom missed Mary a lot.
My bike has been stolen.
Tom didn't say when he'd be back.
She ran over her lines once before she went on stage.
Tom and Mary must be very hungry.
"If this happens again, call me."
Is it my turn?
I hope that it rains tomorrow.
I was fortunate to get the job.
Do as you're told to do.
We didn't smile.
I've only known Tom for a few months.
Beware of jellyfish.
Look at that.
Maybe Tom went shopping with Mary.
"The higher we climb, the colder it gets."
Do you think the road is wide enough for cars?
That's not a dictionary.
He put all his money in the box.
I just don't feel like doing that right now.
Prices will continue as they are.
They laughed.
Tom goes to work by motorcycle.
She said that she had been happy.
Who do you think we are?
Is Tom afraid of that?
Wait for me. I'll be back.
Now he tells me the truth.
I wish you a happy birthday.
I lost.
That's what happens.
I purposely didn't do that.
You didn't tell me that you knew Tom.
She's no singer.
His mother prevented him from going out because she was anxious about his health.
That's not entirely correct.
I do hope you'll come again.
You know very well that I'm right.
The bark of this tree is very rough.
They've had a talk.
What time did Tom say that happened?
Novels aren't being read as much as they used to be.
I am happy to hear your voice.
I really like snow.
Is this all yours?
Nobody knows your secret.
Did you call the police?
That's not something I want to do.
We'll see you next Monday.
Tom's busy.
I'd like to book a double room.
Why didn't you tell me you didn't like chocolate?
Lock your door.
He took the job reluctantly.
Pay what you want.
Should I help you?
Tom is still breathing.
Do you know what time it is in Boston?
I'm in the toilet.
Tom is all dressed up.
Tom's stranded.
Ask around.
I don't do that well.
They need new shoes.
I miss this place.
"If the wind dies down, we'll go."
He's gone senile.
He always wears blue shirts.
It seems worthless.
Throw the dice.
I regret having said that to him.
I'll meet Tom.
What kind of trouble are you in?
I wonder why Tom gave me this.
She advised him to become a teacher.
I'll take the more expensive one.
Reading books will make you smarter.
I can't remember when I first met Tom.
Tom attempted to cheer Mary up.
Tom lives a few blocks from here.
Where did Tom get it?
A lot of truck drivers eat here.
We don't have a thing to worry about.
How many hours of sleep do you need?
I ran into the house because it started to rain.
Do you still live in the same place?
Tom said that Mary was tall.
He was almost asleep when he heard his name called.
Did you lose weight?
How about doing that now?
Come anytime.
Would they recognize you?
It was so cold that I stayed at home all day.
"If you want me to go, I'll go."
Let's do this now.
They said that it was important.
Be quiet.
Can you help me find my keys?
You've got a lot of work ahead of you.
I can't continue to ignore the problem.
The boy over there is his brother.
I just got a message from Tom.
Don't distract me.
I didn't know what I'd done was illegal.
I want Tom fired.
Tom told Mary where to plant the roses.
What will the Japanese economy be like next year?
Would you like to play a game of chess?
Tom said he couldn't wait.
Tom said you wanted to see me.
I think it's too late.
We leave immediately.
I should've been with you.
Tom is shy.
Tom didn't even do that.
I've been waiting a long time for you.
I want to go out with Tom.
You can ask him for help.
Tom folded the newspaper and put it under his arm.
Tom started to empty his pockets.
The police detained several suspects for questioning.
I wanted Tom to be successful.
Tom does need you.
You look like you're jealous.
Tom is crazy about me.
I wouldn't ask you to do that.
You have every right to be angry with me.
Tom and I have no secrets from each other.
This is such a sad day.
Ask Tom to wait for me.
I've made a lot of stupid mistakes.
I'll tell you everything I know.
Tom dreamed that he was dreaming.
I owe you a lot.
Tom drank himself to death.
I knew that I shouldn't be doing that.
Say that's not true.
Here's your desk.
The police are going to catch you sooner or later.
I go to the library every other day.
The cat is eating.
Tom has asked me to talk to you.
Large or small?
There's a sucker born every minute.
Someone has to do it.
I've decided to fire you.
Tom disagreed with Mary about many things.
I don't have time to argue with you.
What laws have I broken?
At least you'll have something to write home about.
My daughter loves jumping rope.
You were probably wrong.
Please move the chair. It's in the way.
Tom wiped the lipstick off his cheek.
Let me know when you'll be ready.
I didn't ask you for your opinion.
Tom kept Mary awake all night with his snoring.
Please show me another one.
I just felt like hearing the sound of your voice.
Are you afraid of me?
Tom plans to stay for three weeks.
Hand me that broom.
I have to return this book to the library.
I hope everything went well.
You're bad.
Please make my bed.
Tom told me I wouldn't be able to do that.
Tom fed the neighbor's cat while they were away.
A baby boy was born to them.
I'll be watching you.
I'm lying on the grass.
Where did you buy all this?
I didn't know I'd get punished.
I couldn't have done it without you. Thank you.
There were no hats in that store that fit me.
I'm about to leave.
I take vitamins.
We've had complaints from our neighbors.
We can't do this again.
Tom said he wanted to talk to you. Is that why you're here now?
I baked it for you.
Come back soon.
I think you've been here before.
Tom finished writing the report in less than three hours.
What does the dog want?
There are lots of ways to do that.
Commit these words to memory.
Tom didn't brush his teeth.
Tom doesn't live here anymore.
That's what we need.
Who do you think Tom will suggest?
Tom nodded slowly.
I didn't attend the meeting.
Count your change.
Why aren't you at Tom's?
I've got so much to do.
He gave me a push and got ahead of me.
When will your homework be finished?
Please explain the delay.
What did you order?
I couldn't have done that if you hadn't been helping me.
Put it on the shelf.
How much did all this cost?
Do you want us to wait?
Tom thought Mary could do it.
Everyone here likes you.
I've already read today's paper.
I'm going with you.
I was born in Kyoto.
His paper is better than mine.
I don't want to help you.
"Eventually, the police are going to catch you."
I wish I hadn't tried to do that by myself.
We were created in God's image.
Tom called Mary at around 2:30.
It's all a misunderstanding.
Steel production is estimated to reach 100 million tons this year.
You broke your promise.
Stop!
Stop smiling.
Where are you sitting at the moment?
Tom didn't have to go anywhere.
Tom forgot to close the door.
He likes sweets.
The university administration lowered tuition.
Tom spends a lot of his free time reading.
Give me a moment.
How many cars have you had?
Tom is having a good time in Boston.
He likes hunting.
Call your father.
Tom's French is perfect.
I hope to see you.
I'm the only one here who can do that.
"If there was no sun, all the animals would be dead."
Tom seemed to like doing that.
I know something about this.
I'd like to be alone now.
He is proud of having been educated in the United States.
Tom handed the empty bottle to Mary.
Did you ever have that problem?
Please tell me how to take the medicine.
I thought you were serious.
Italy is a peninsula.
Put your valuables in the safe.
How can I get rid of him?
Tom hasn't had a pay raise for three years.
I've started learning French.
What have you got in that box?
Tom asked me if I had found the keys.
I think it's sad to have no friends.
Will Tom eat with us?
"Oh, by the way, I have something to give you."
Do you want some advice?
Spend some money on yourself.
I need you to bring it to me.
They wash their car every Saturday.
Many young people in Japan eat bread for breakfast.
I know that you were just doing your job.
I'll take Tom home.
Tom refused to give Mary her money back.
Do you remember anything else?
That won't be hard to do.
I suggest you buy it.
You draw pretty well.
This ink stain will not wash out.
Your lips are red.
They should thank me.
Have you ever been fired?
We're here to support you.
He should have been an actor.
I was unaware of the problem.
I've already lost too much time.
His family works in the fields.
Tom wouldn't lend me his bicycle.
Humans are the only animals that wear clothes.
I'll never ask you for anything else.
I'll show you to your room.
This store doesn't sell dogs.
We have something in common.
Will you show me your photo album?
Read it once more.
People don't forget things like that.
Everyone needs to get out of here.
I have a question.
The bell had already rung when I got to school.
Do you get up at six?
I hate my job sometimes.
Tom has nowhere to go.
Give me back my book.
This book sells very well.
I'm not joking.
It's too small.
I tried to call Tom again.
How can you know that?
Tom doesn't have any real friends.
"If you don't want to get married, you don't have to."
I'll take these roses.
Would you like to sing?
Are you my father?
I think the box is empty.
"If you'd like to study French with a native speaker, please contact me."
I gave Tom your address.
I think that he is right.
Tom bought a new pair of gloves.
I've never made a lot of money.
You're so serious.
Do you realize what you're doing?
Tom opened the closet.
Tom always treats me like a child.
Tom is walking down the corridor.
Tom said you wanted to go to Australia with us.
Did you go to the restaurant yesterday?
I don't think I need anybody's permission to do that.
"You're right, as usual."
I didn't see what happened to Tom.
I'll show you.
I don't think that it'll be easy.
We've got three minutes.
Why didn't you come earlier?
Tom may have won.
What's the bad news?
The door blew shut.
"He's not a bus driver, is he?"
Tom didn't invite me to his party.
One man was killed.
I know you have homework to do.
Didn't you know Tom was Mary's father?
I'm trying to get a tan.
Where did you find it?
It is difficult to speak three languages.
Just give me the phone.
How did your date with Tom go?
The old man tends to exaggerate.
Tom's bicycle was stolen last week.
I stayed close to Tom.
"Hey, where were you?"
Do you want to see my stamp collection?
We looked for it high and low.
The situation calls for drastic measures.
I'm not that kind of girl.
I wanted to make Tom smile.
Tom decided to go ahead and ask Mary the question he had been wanting to ask.
We lost it.
I like coffee better.
I don't think I know that boy.
We'll both go.
I drank milk.
"You know some French, don't you?"
In life there are ups and downs.
I'm following you.
Tom told Mary he'd stay at John's place.
Didn't you know Mary was Tom's girlfriend?
I don't want you hanging out with Tom.
He is very good at the guitar.
Let's change the topic.
We have three airplanes.
I need more.
Life in a small town is boring.
Tom has been lying to us this whole time.
"Tom, there's a call for you."
That's what happens when you share your toys.
Only one person was injured.
I'm not surprised that that happened.
The sun is shining in the sky.
Tom is facing eviction if he doesn't pay his back rent by the end of this month.
"Two large coffees, please."
Just ignore that.
What would you have said to Tom?
I must fix it.
His eyes were full of tears.
It was spooky.
I'm not planning on staying here very long.
I didn't see anything at all.
I let Tom win.
There wasn't anything else in the box.
I've saved you a seat next to me.
I shouldn't have done that without permission.
Do you think that Tom would try to do that?
Is there a desk in your room?
I'm not as tall as you.
He is in the kitchen.
He loves trains.
Tom doesn't seem to care about anything else.
Please visit me tomorrow.
I want to know where it is.
Nothing's happening.
Tom has a similar problem.
Don't forget to answer his letter.
Who broke the vase?
I wish I could drop off to sleep like that.
I wonder whether Tom will come or not.
Let go of my arm!
Tom is my oldest son.
There's no doubt that Tom poisoned Mary.
She didn't visit anybody.
Tom handed the pen to Mary.
Tom tried.
Did you tell Tom he could go see Mary tonight?
"He could not speak, he was so angry."
How would you describe yourself?
This is the difficult part.
"You think I'm mad, don't you?"
Tom understood the rules.
Tom didn't tell me about it.
Let's play something.
Tom said it was time to leave.
Tom thought Mary might be late.
Are you sure Tom left?
Both his sisters are beautiful.
Do you know how busy I've been?
Could you show me how to use this pump?
What makes you think I disagree with Tom?
You're losing your hair.
She was watching TV with tears in her eyes.
How many hours of sleep do you need?
The man you just saw is a great musician.
I know you'll enjoy this book.
Why did you cry?
I got Tom to help me.
It's more than enough.
I was strong.
"If I were rich, I'd give you money."
I forced him to go.
It's amazing how much Tom can stand.
What's your natural hair color?
Isn't that what you always wanted?
"I can't gain weight, no matter what I eat."
I really don't understand what you're talking about.
I know Tom.
Tom told me he wasn't sick.
It's a stupid idea.
We're fighting for our lives.
I like to do that.
Consider the facts.
They are talking in the kitchen.
I'll fix it now.
We only need one.
Would you like to run your own business?
I found Tom a job.
I will give you the money tomorrow.
Do you remember what happened last night?
The typhoon did a lot of damage to the crops.
"Hey, wait for me."
I don't think Tom has ever had a girlfriend.
"I warned him, but he ignored the warning."
Yamamoto had one hundred sixty-two ships.
Tom sold his house.
Tom has to be on time.
I'm glad we were able to spend some time together.
I know him.
Have you ever been attacked by a dog?
We don't yet know what we're up against.
Tom asked me if I missed Mary.
We work for Tom.
It'll be harder than you think.
Where's the rest?
I don't think that Tom knows what Mary's shoe size is.
Don't be a copycat.
They deserve it.
Tom helped Mary pry open the door.
Tom calls all the time.
I think it's about time I had a serious talk with Tom.
This soup needs more salt.
That's more than enough.
What are you doing?
Stay in this room.
What did you buy this expensive dictionary for?
It's time for you to tell me the whole truth.
Tom has an electric pencil sharpener.
Thirteen people were wounded.
I've never seen it.
Tom thought he had a chance to survive.
I'm so proud of you.
Do you live around here?
Tom poured milk into a bowl for his cat.
Tom knew that Mary was trying to do that.
I walked alone.
We've done what we could.
Please play something by Chopin for me.
Many people left.
Tom never told me he didn't know how to swim.
My life is in your hands.
Tom knows Mary better than he knows anyone else.
All wished each other a Merry Christmas.
Will this satisfy you?
What is the situation in Boston?
What business is that of yours?
I lied to both of you.
Paper was first invented in China.
What day of the week is it?
I'll be in my office all afternoon.
Turn down the TV.
You're such a gossip.
Give me a good one.
Tom likes soup.
Tom has already left Boston.
Is there anything you can do about it?
No one is coming to save you.
I told Tom what I think.
Please translate this.
I'm not used to this heat.
I just found out that Tom has been kidnapped.
Our ancestors came to this country 150 years ago.
I didn't know what to expect.
What kind of books does Tom read?
The problem's not on our end.
Don't worry. It's perfectly safe.
It was persuasive.
I don't go to bars.
Do you know how to tie your shoes?
I remember being here before.
She reserved a room.
Tom told Mary about everything that had happened.
Tom and John are twins.
He speaks both English and French.
Were you the one who told Tom that he shouldn't go?
I'm glad you liked my friends.
It was awful.
Am I ever wrong?
Tom certainly won't get my vote.
Are you mad?
It's raining there.
Can you tell me what happened to Tom?
I was the last to arrive.
Everyone in my family gets up early.
Have I convinced you?
I asked her to dance.
Tom hasn't sharpened the knives yet.
Please correct me if I make a mistake.
You owe me nothing.
I felt it was worth the risk.
Can I talk with you?
You should've been a little more patient.
He stayed at the hotel for two days.
The man fell down on the ground.
"Thank you for helping me. ""Don't mention it."""
I'd like to see you again.
I believe that you will succeed.
It'll take some time to get used to wearing a wig.
The price of vegetables varies from day to day.
That would be hard.
Did you warn Tom?
I'm glad that the rain has stopped.
Tom told me I needed to be more aggressive.
"The more you tell me, the more I can help."
Tom handed the package to me.
What else happened?
I don't think Tom knows how to do that.
Tom consumes a lot of wine.
I prefer it that way.
They won't tell you the truth.
I have a couple of questions I'd like to ask.
"I had never been abroad before, so everything seemed strange to me."
Do you think that I'm not trying?
Tom wanted to buy a cheaper car.
Call a plumber.
That's quite a risky job.
I was going to call Tom.
I've just finished writing the report.
We talked without the aid of an interpreter.
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
I smell something burning.
Mary put the turkey in the oven.
"Tom, I think we need to help Mary. It looks like she's in trouble."
Wait here until I return.
"Mary is cute. ""So is Alice."""
Are you sure this is what you want?
I don't believe in curses.
We don't have enough time to do that.
Do you want some coffee?
It's very serious.
"Tom could've helped me, but he didn't."
I told Tom to go home.
I understand French better than I can speak it.
Do it anyway.
Did you plant pumpkins this year?
He cannot be saved.
What did you eat last night?
Everyone is tired.
Isn't this what you wanted?
Are they Japanese or Chinese?
Did you talk to Tom about me yet?
I knew you'd have a good time.
Tom has more money than Mary.
I wanted to read a book.
Do you ever sleep?
Tom asked me to meet him at the airport.
It's really not a good idea.
The last city on my list was Boston.
We came together.
Who was it who wrote these two letters?
I'm going to bed.
Can you advise me on what I should do?
My French hasn't gotten any better since the last time we met.
I had my watch repaired.
Don't say anything.
This place is great.
How do you know so much about it?
Let's have a look inside.
Don't talk to him while he's driving.
"I went skating yesterday, too."
When was the last time you got a pedicure?
Should I tell Tom what happened?
"This isn't your hat, is it?"
Did you try this key?
Give me another nail.
I am fond of cars.
Are you going to Tom and Mary's wedding?
Mary's husband must miss her.
Tom left Australia three weeks ago.
I'll be working.
It's a little cold today.
Tom relaxed a bit.
I hoped Tom wouldn't win.
Did you bring enough water?
Do you know what's in that box?
I always get up at six-thirty.
Tom didn't seem angry.
I can't decide what to order.
I don't know what Tom will say.
Tom tried to kill us.
Is she your teacher?
I cannot understand what you say.
I always stay at home on Sundays.
Three people have been arrested.
I lost my keys.
Tom chuckled.
I pretended that I didn't understand.
Tom threw the apple to me.
I knew Tom would accept my invitation.
Let me do that myself.
He can neither read nor write.
There was a pink slip waiting for her at the office.
That's the best I can do.
Tom wanted Mary to help him.
That's an order that I can't give.
I stayed in Australia for three weeks.
I didn't know you couldn't sing.
Don't you understand what's happening here?
I just got fired.
Tom put the book aside.
I am quite satisfied.
You're so impatient.
"I think that Tom is going to do that, too."
Why did you give Tom money?
"Sorry, we don't accept credit cards."
I want to continue working for Tom.
Tom looks a little tired.
Come here this minute.
Tom said he wanted to leave Boston.
Tom waved to Mary.
Tom accepted the inevitable.
"I'm not sure, but Tom may come."
I want to play better.
Don't ever lie to me again.
I think I made a mistake.
Tom needs to go.
You may come tomorrow.
Don't you trust anybody?
A pair of earrings is a nice present for her.
Tom said that it wasn't him who did that.
Tom works in Silicon Valley.
Tom could've talked to me first.
I know this will be difficult.
He was walking toward the sea.
Don't tell anyone.
I'm thinking about you.
What do you have?
I'm glad the rumors weren't true.
Tom threw a big party at his house while his parents were away on vacation.
The weather was getting worse and worse as the day went on.
I thought you wouldn't come.
I don't know any of the five ladies.
There are no direct flights to Bologna from here.
Tom won't be gone long.
Everyone admired his courage.
I persuaded him to give up the idea.
I'm just as busy as Tom.
We'll stand.
This is possible.
I cannot help thinking that my son is still alive.
Tom is too young to buy beer.
I'm running a little behind schedule.
They headed downstairs.
I know how to do that.
"You think I'm stupid, don't you?"
We're flying back to Boston on the 20th.
Please write a letter to me.
Are you all completely crazy?
I have a much more serious problem.
He begged his father to buy him a bicycle.
I got the news from a reliable source.
One of us should do that.
They're separated.
It's time for you to get to work.
Do you have your driver's license?
Tom has a good alibi.
The store is already closed.
We came to see you.
Did Tom tell you anything about this?
You're my only true friend.
Tom hardly knew Mary.
Tom likes to have fun.
"Tom was tired, but not sleepy."
Let's not forget.
I don't know whose glasses these are.
Why should I stop doing this?
I suppose I could help.
I thought that Tom didn't understand French.
School is over.
Turn on the TV.
I tried to convince myself that I hadn't done anything wrong.
Tom didn't get there in time.
Tom said Mary was retired.
You'll be dead someday.
The trees were full of birds.
I've got a plan.
How did you come to know her?
Tom is unsociable.
Tom never watches TV.
We were all so busy then.
Tom's train left five minutes ago.
I hoped you'd do that.
I recognized him at first glance.
Tom can die happy now.
When did I write this article?
This is as it should be.
Tom slept in the car.
I'm glad I invited you.
Do you think Tom can do it?
Tom is staying there.
"If you want to leave, you may."
I found a nice restaurant.
Tom will probably never win again.
Nobody cares what you think.
"I wanted to do that, but I didn't."
I've been doing that too long.
Why didn't you wake me?
Everyone thought Tom was Canadian.
I looked in the trunk.
I'm taking my book with me.
Tom asked Mary who her father was.
He adores his grandfather.
Do you know what it is?
I don't think anybody was here yesterday.
It was a fantastic day.
I listen to the radio every night.
Is your freezer still working?
"If they got caught, they'd have to do five years."
It was really nice meeting you.
Tom went completely insane.
You can't go against the laws of nature.
Tom sat down on a log.
Tom is still too young to drink.
This problem won't go away.
Contact your local police if you have any information on Tom Jackson's whereabouts.
Where did Tom hear that?
Math is my least favorite subject.
The dressmaker took Mary's measurements.
Tom put the key in the lock and paused a moment before he turned it.
I won't let you escape.
I was watching TV when the telephone rang.
Can you run fast?
Put it on the table.
You're the prisoner.
It is essential for you to practice every day.
Cats like boxes.
My mother could speak five languages.
They say they've already paid.
We've seen it before.
I'm waiting for your reply.
I love summer rain.
Don't lie. Tell the truth.
This is an important victory.
She plays the guitar.
I was coughing all night.
Collective interests must be protected.
Oleg always answered the questions quickly.
This is gibberish.
Don't push me.
Stop crying.
We already sang that song.
Don't smoke so much.
It is too good to be true.
"Take it, or leave it."
Tom will give us everything we've asked for.
Tom got furious.
I'd never go there by myself.
Did you catch the train?
May I talk to you now?
Tom said that the soup was too hot.
I wish Tom had waited.
Is Tom smiling?
I missed seeing that movie. Did you see it?
Do you have two books?
Tom knows this isn't good.
Can you make me a copy?
Tom has already written three books.
Mary told Tom she didn't want to see him anymore.
Tom told Mary she was right.
Why are you so hard-headed?
I'll go with you.
Tom was shot dead.
Don't you want to say goodbye to Tom?
I've got a lot of stories I could tell you.
The boy came running into the room.
I've forgotten your number.
I started the timer.
Open the drapes.
"First, I want you to apologize to Tom."
What do you think of Japanese food?
I know why Tom was fired.
How many meters are in a kilometer?
They don't have any money.
He's a historian.
I need to know what you plan to do.
I'd rather not discuss it here.
I think it'll snow today.
I found everything I wanted.
I went camping with my family.
I think Tom was speaking French.
I'm afraid you have to work overtime.
I'd like to speak to you.
Here's today's report.
It's the same every year.
I'm not invincible.
Didn't you know that Tom had relatives in Australia?
We want the truth.
When does Tom leave?
I ran out of money during my stay in India.
Tom wasn't in Boston last week.
You didn't say how much it cost.
I made up for lost time.
I couldn't invite him. We're not well acquainted.
I think you'd better do that.
Don't work so much.
This increase in unemployment is a consequence of the recession.
Pick it up.
I think I won't go to Australia next winter.
Can I go with Tom?
It gets on my nerves.
Tom may not survive the night.
Why did Tom come back home so early?
I like spending time with Tom.
Tom doesn't like to work by himself.
Tom may not make it.
Tom loves talking about art.
You're the only one who can help me.
I thought Tom was scared.
You must succeed.
Why are these people here?
"Why did you do that, and not Tom?"
This thing won't last long.
Are you hungry now?
She is too weak.
Tom has three uncles in Boston.
I wasn't afraid to do that.
I've promised to help Tom today.
Let's eat out this evening.
Please lock the door when you leave.
Stop apologizing.
The boys are noisy.
This was a mistake.
Tom left just after Mary left.
I always think of him when I'm alone.
Spare me the technical details.
You have visitors.
Everyone is different.
Your office isn't as large as mine.
My friends congratulated me on my success.
Don't listen to him. He's just kidding.
Tom wants to be liked.
The situation seems hopeless.
What should we do with Tom?
The room is very gloomy.
Tom didn't arrive at the agreed-upon time.
The noise disturbed his sleep.
Why does Tom work?
Do you think he will like that?
I would've paid.
Please say yes.
"Don't give up now, Tom."
We're the only ones here from Boston.
Hold on tight.
He's a citizen of China.
I didn't know that would happen.
Should I wait for you here?
This one's OK.
You shouldn't have talked to Tom.
I think I shouldn't have done that.
You're wonderful.
Fresh fruits and vegetables are good for you.
Ask Tom how Mary is.
What was Tom's crime?
I must tell you something.
"Tom ran all the way to the station, but he still missed his train."
I don't like looking foolish.
She still loves him.
Tom is as fit as a fiddle.
That's what I want most of all.
Tom wasn't able to read until he was thirteen.
Tom is tired of people telling him what to do.
Tom's dog is dangerous.
Tom looked well the last time I saw him.
Tom decided to serve Mary breakfast in bed.
This story is worth reading.
I want you to lose.
We should determine what is to be done first.
What should we do next?
I'll go tell Tom the good news.
Would you like to drink anything?
It is necessary for you to help her.
Tom translated a letter from French to English for his boss.
Tom is coming to our school tomorrow.
I think Tom would've helped us if he'd been here.
"Tom, get us out of here!"
How do you do it?
My house is on Park Street.
Take Tom.
Are you conservative?
Tom is using the Internet to learn Spanish.
Tom pulled a small flashlight out of his pocket.
Tom began to suspect Mary was lying to him.
Tom often gets headaches.
I used to lived on Park Street.
Tom stopped the video.
It's not done yet.
I sometimes don't understand you.
I think Tom is lying.
Tom didn't have any proof.
When does the show start?
What do you think that means?
I liked your story.
Are those your children?
Will you be here on Monday?
I heard today Tom will be retiring soon.
Watch out for cars when you cross the street.
I know these people.
Why are we not allowed to do that?
Tom tried to squeeze in between Mary and John.
You should apologize.
This must be done by Monday.
No one told me what I should do.
Tom eagerly ate the apple I gave him.
Her daughter is very pretty.
Can we fish there?
The general gave the order to retreat.
Come here. I need to tell you something.
Nobody wants him to come.
I should've told Tom to stay in Boston.
He neither wrote nor telephoned.
Tom told Mary not to go there.
Tom doesn't know what Mary is looking for.
"I want to show you something, Tom."
It all depends how you handle it.
Tom believed the story that Mary told him.
Do they like you?
I didn't lie.
Could you explain it to me?
I should've paid closer attention.
Don't lose heart.
I sent a message to you.
Mary doesn't use salt in her cooking.
My father is so old that he can't work.
Do you want to talk about something?
You missed the point entirely.
Everybody laughed at you.
Tom would've done that differently.
You know I can do that.
I can get you fired.
I thought you were going to ask us to leave.
The question took Tom by surprise.
Do you happen to know what happened?
I hope you come to my concert.
Did you tell Tom he could borrow your car?
Does anyone know what caused the problem?
I think that you should do that today.
I've finished cleaning the apartment.
Is Tom going with you?
Please speak slower.
Do you have any oranges?
I can't help you because I am busy.
"I'm not hungry, but I'm thirsty."
Tom didn't know what it was for.
We need this report by tomorrow.
Didn't you know that?
All apples are red.
Are you blind?
My mom still calls me Tom.
He didn't say anything.
Tom stopped to take a close look at the car.
I left Boston three years ago and I've never been back.

Have you met everyone here?
It's going to take us a long time to do that.
The stock reached its high point last July.
I'm sorry about the other day.
They cheat.
It is hardly raining.
I need to talk to you about something.
Does Tom want to do that?
He had a hard time making a living.
What did you have for dinner?
How many museums did you visit?
She doesn't have any friends or relatives to take care of her.
I hate the smell of garlic.
I hope I didn't hurt you.
I wanted to prove to myself I could do it.
You're nothing.
Tom worked as a truck driver in Boston.
We'd make a perfect team.
I'll call Tom Monday evening.
Everyone is here except for him.
We're free now.
Tom doesn't know how Mary did that.
Fill this bottle with water.
I was actually born in Boston.
I'll borrow an umbrella from someone.
Tom told me Mary was upset.
Perfect!
I seldom make the same mistake twice.
Tom decided not to go hiking with Mary.
Would you like to visit the White House someday?
Where are the flowers now?
Let's do this together.
"You're married, aren't you?"
I don't normally eat this kind of food.
"Say ""aah."""
Why don't you tell Tom about it?
I heard that.
You're old.
Tom has many powerful friends.
I see you have your guitar with you. Are you planning on playing something for us?
Do you accept traveler's checks?
I'm sure Tom will be OK.
"You have a car, don't you?"
He stayed up late.
Next time I'll come earlier.
I'm a very careful person.
Everything you said was false.
I knew nothing about it.
Will you sing for me?
I won't sign this contract.
Tom left me.
He sells us paper.
Tom asked if we had done that.
May I pay by check?
I didn't get on the bus.
I can lend you one if you want.
Is dinner ready?
I ignored Tom.
Tom says he owes Mary money.
You should always knock on the door before you enter my room.
This bus is going to Boston.
The man Tom is talking to is a lawyer.
They were friends.
Tom went into hiding.
Do you work with Tom?
I'm surprised that Tom didn't agree with you.
Tom only listens to punk rock.
I saw my reflection in the window.
Tom knows that I'm at home.
I thought I heard a thud.
I refuse to pay.
I eat only when I'm hungry.
Tell Tom when to come.
The officers arrested three of the protesters.
There are no roses without thorns.
You're really gifted.
I've got to relax.
This water is a little salty.
I am not eating.
Tom refused to eat what his mother put on the table.
Tell Tom to call me back.
Tom looks like he's shocked.
He told me where to go.
Tom didn't want to leave his house.
Let me rephrase that.
I wanted to go to Australia.
I told you to stop calling me that.
I became very sleepy after a bit of reading.
Have you eaten pork this week?
You're a terrible person.
You must be at least 17 years old to donate blood.
We all agree that we should leave early.
You must stop smoking.
Which book do you need?
It is very expensive.
Are you sure you don't want to go to Boston?
How exactly did they do that?
I was surprised to learn that Tom was a liberal.
Tom got out of jail in October.
"I saw Tom, but he didn't see me."
I told Tom the truth about us.
What happened to the other one?
Only Tom didn't want to go.
This should've been done a long time ago.
People aren't always rational.
I'm the one who convinced Tom to join the army.
Tom volunteered to help us do that.
They won't speak to you.
Did he go home yesterday?
Do you think Tom is in Boston?
"The longer I stayed in Paris, the more I liked it."
I'm sorry for breaking my promise.
I'll bring one more towel.
Are you sure your parents will allow you to go?
I don't think Tom knows his neighbors.
Tom doesn't know that I'm hungry.
Do you remember that day?
He took out his passport.
Japan is hot and humid in the summer.
I don't work here.
Why did you come to Boston?
Tom was totally drunk.
I know you're coming.
Tom changed clothes.
Did you two break up?
Did you know Tom had relatives in Australia?
They said that.
What's your favorite animal?
Is it large enough?
"You want me to help you, don't you?"
"If it happened to Tom, it could happen to me."
I have a secret dream.
She gave me a haughty look and walked away.
It's raining here.
He lives with his mother.
Tom drinks tea more often than coffee.
I made Tom leave his suitcase behind.
Some were unwilling to fight.
Tell us what that is.
Tom forgot to do his homework.
What makes you think you're my type?
Please stop yelling.
He has no hat on.
Shut up and eat.
"I knew I couldn't do it, but I tried anyway."
I think Tom knows.
Do as Tom says.
Do you think you know me?
Do you know where Tom went?
Do you believe that there's life after death?
I don't think you fully understand the consequences.
Tom claims that you stole his bicycle.
Look after Tom.
"You don't understand anything, do you?"
We'll take that into consideration.
Who will you go with?
Don't make a mountain out of a molehill.
All we can do now is wait and see what Tom does.
How often are you sick?
Tom told Mary that he'd stay at John's place.
Make a wish.
How do you know Tom did that?
It is time you told her the truth.
You can visit me tomorrow.
I'm not opening the door for Tom.
Thank you for your help.
Do you think that was deliberate?
He asked about you.
It's locked.
You didn't have to ask.
Tom was unaware of what was happening.
That's a serious accusation.
How do they put up with you?
Slight inattention can cause a great disaster.
I never hear anything.
Why don't you ever help?
This is all perfectly normal.
I need a red pen.
"Generally, men are taller than women."
Nobody knows how I feel.
Should I drive on the way back?
That's chicken.
"When you finish reading this letter, burn it."
Tom studied abroad.
Are you sure you don't want to do this?
I got up at six-thirty this morning.
He was innocent.
Do you think Tom will be in Boston all summer?
The letter is addressed to my parents.
Didn't you sing?
I know that Tom is homesick.
There's something I forgot to say.
Tom is on his lunch break.
You were driving too fast.
You should just talk to Tom.
"You're in a hurry, aren't you?"
Open your books.
You can't pay too much for good shoes.
I'm not always wrong.
Tom thinks that I did that on purpose.
Let Tom do this.
I'm sure you would've done the same for me.
The concert's been canceled.
We're out of gas.
I'm not sure Tom will be there.
This is the first time I've paid a fine.
Try not to cry.
I am eating an apple.
I'm not sure I'm ready.
This year is an important year for me.
Have you finished writing the report?
Lions are animals.
He looks well.
Here he is!
I can't offer you anything in return.
Tom is reading a newspaper.
I have to learn French.
One out of ten people suffers from a lack of sleep.
I'm not a very good chess player.
Why's Tom so worried about Mary?
Tom helped Mary take off her shoes.
Listen up.
I was woken up by the sound of thunder this morning.
"If you don't take a vacation, you'll collapse."
Do you have your plane ticket?
I admit my mistake.
Your CV has really impressed me.
I avoid reading the news.
The moon is brighter than usual tonight.
He thinks I'm in love with her.
Don't do it.
I couldn't buy it.
"Tom is three years older than you, isn't he?"
I'm afraid that would be a waste of time.
How much do I owe you for the ticket?
I see Tom trusts you.
I'll sue you.
Do you still live where you used to?
I wonder whose glasses these are.
I'm so happy to see you again.
What if Tom says no?
Science has changed my life.
I'm supposed to go to Boston.
Tom said he's proud of Mary.
I'd like to earn more money.
They arrived here in 1997.
I'm lucky no one saw me do that.
Tom is going nuts.
Have some cake.
Tom says Mary is innocent.
Did you receive a Christmas present from Tom this year?
Tom doesn't speak to me.
That coffee smells good.
I drank out of your glass by mistake.
Where did you find my umbrella?
Tom will be prepared for it.
I think you should stay here.
I don't even know where to start.
Don't talk to him while he's driving.
I want to shake his hand.
I'd be happy to help you.
Have you ever been in trouble with the law?
I asked Tom for a favor.
Tom wants you to take out the garbage.
Should I start?
I can't see anything at all.
Don't tell me you've forgotten what day it is.
I'm glad Tom won.
We won't allow it.
I liked the show.
You have to use the money wisely.
The bridge collapsed when one of the cables broke.
I don't expect anything from you.
It's time to eat lunch.
Tom felt great.
We must be careful.
Are you still eating?
Why are we moving?
Please come here.
Tom found Mary's behavior suspicious.
We must take measures to prevent traffic accidents.
Tom thinks you can do that.
I knew I had to come.
Did you know that Tom was kidnapped when he was three?
I go to church by car.
He fell asleep behind the wheel and had an accident.
I suspected that Tom wouldn't be able to win.
"Frankly speaking, I don't care for her very much."
We both speak French.
Tom told me he was ambidextrous.
Do you know what Tom's secret is?
My grandma has gotten very old.
What did you order?
I have a pain in my neck.
I couldn't write a single word.
"Incredible, isn't it?"
Everyone laughed except for Tom.
Don't blame me for your mistakes.
I knew that you'd do that.
Tom is jealous.
You're a celebrity now.
You're the only one who understands how I feel.
Tom fell down and wasn't able to get up.
Tell Tom that I want to talk to him.
Why haven't you told us?
I plan to stay there one week.
Lunch is at noon.
Tom knows Mary better than anyone else does.
We adopted Tom.
I don't play that game.
We won the battle.
Where did Tom go fishing?
We don't have time to help Tom.
Focus on the present moment.
Breakfast is served between 7 and 9.
Why do you work here?
I want to find Tom.
This book cost me a fortune.
Tom never even talked to Mary.
What's in it for me?
"According to her, he won't come."
You were sick.
You're not ready.
"She was blind, deaf, and dumb."
They accused him of manslaughter.
Let's take a detour.
Have a nice evening.
Tom and Mary started throwing snowballs at each other.
He got tired soon.
You are richer than I am because your pay is double my pay.
I have pneumonia.
I used to be lazy.
Did Mary really kill her husband?
I have a tourist visa.
Your parents are expecting your call.
Give me your book.
I don't like your name.
I brought reinforcements.
Come with me to the station.
Can you break a five dollar bill?
"Long, long ago, there lived an old man in a village."
Do you know whether Tom is married or single?
I'm a magician.
What did Tom give you for your birthday?
Was all of that true?
They found us.
I believe you know what I mean.
You'll have to drive.
Is there a lot left to do?
Do you like candy?
Let me take you to a Japanese restaurant.
That's hardly likely.
What's the departure time?
The engine wouldn't start.
Your father is quite tall.
Tom just moved to town.
Tom is acting like nothing happened.
He is too old.
Tom thought I was Mary.
Watch Tom carefully. He's dangerous.
It isn't easy for me.
She is capable of anything.
Tom knows that Mary is over thirty.
Tom didn't need to tell me that. I already knew that.
Tom was crazy.
Please give me a sheet of paper.
I hope it doesn't rain today.
Don't forget your passport.
Can you find it?
They formed a new political party.
You're all dressed up. Where are you going?
Few people seem to have read the book.
Tom slipped and hit his head.
Tom coaxed the mouse out of the hole in the wall with a piece of bread.
They have families.
I began living by myself.
Does anyone know that you're here?
Tom says that's a lie.
Tom was reluctant to talk about it.
You're quicker than me.
What a lot of pens!
They could've gone anywhere.
I don't think Tom knows how much money Mary makes.
Let me step inside.
Let's take a trip.
I know you can't stop Tom.
Tom told Mary everything he knew about what had happened.
You make me happy.
Who can be calling me at this hour?
Don't forget to talk with him tomorrow.
I have nowhere else to go.
Just take one.
Tom wanted to prove to Mary that he could do it.
Didn't you know any of them?
What just happened here?
"The baby can't walk, much less run."
I can't believe that you like that restaurant.
Tom said I looked upset.
Don't look for me.
What exactly are we trying to find?
I saw what your dog did.
Everyone knows they like each other.
English is the world's language.
She was afraid of the dog.
Tom doesn't want to tell Mary.
Did you fix it?
I was in the room.
Tom is the worst student in the class.
Tom retired when he was 65 years old.
The singer has a beautiful voice.
Let's begin.
Take your time.
Do you think anyone can see me?
I'll open it.
You'd better stay.
Don't wake her up.
I sent you a box of chocolates.
Tom is walking through the woods.
Last night we worked until 10 p.m.
There is little hope of success.
"What color is your underwear? ""I'm not wearing any."""
Everyone on our street knows Tom.
They claim they're Canadians.
Tom isn't living in Boston.
Tom woke up in the middle of the night.
I think you should leave.
You're a lot like Tom.
I'd like to borrow your car tomorrow.
I went to Boston by plane.
I'll be in the truck.
Where is it hidden?
What business is that of yours?
We were quite happy.
Tom is arranging bail.
Bring your friends with you.
You did that on purpose.
I didn't hear the gunshots.
I promise I won't cry.
Mary often wears revealing clothes.
I wonder how Tom will answer Mary's question.
We don't travel together anymore.
I hope you don't suffer from claustrophobia.
It's worse than you think.
I need a long rope.
I have a better idea. Let's order a pizza and stay here.
Tom called a cab for me.
I'll never forgive myself for that.
I'll show you around.
You shouldn't trust Tom.
"That might happen to you, too."
How did you know we were here?
I'm not stuck.
We still don't know the truth.
Tom and Mary washed the dishes together.
I don't think Tom knows French at all.
I know where Tom works.
Wilson clearly had the best chance to win.
You've helped us all.
I went into the navy.
Tom told me the same thing you told me.
I don't need your money.
I'm glad you're pleased.
Make me a sandwich.
Are you sure it was a ghost?
I'm surprised that Tom doesn't speak French.
A society without religion is like a ship without a compass.
"Take it, please."
Hug Tom for me.
Don't pay attention to him.
Tom has a half-brother.
Did you call Tom last night?
This ticket is valid for three months.
It needs washing.
How is Tom going to help you?
We have ample time to catch our train.
I'm just not very hungry.
How often do you wear a sweater?
I knew that Tom would likely not need to do that.
Who is the lucky guy?
Art was in its golden age in Venice during the Renaissance.
I want to stay with Tom.
Tom had his reasons for staying in Boston.
She's about the same age as I am.
You know it doesn't matter.
I don't think this movie is interesting.
Do you like classical music?
"What's going on with you, Tom?"
Can you make a salad?
Tom wanted to know what Mary thought.
I don't have time to read this book.
Aren't you angry with Tom?
I don't like windy days.
She has a rich vocabulary of English words.
Tom knelt down.
They're strong.
I'd like to know where you bought that.
I wish I had Tom's brains.
Vote for me!
Tom says he doesn't know when the meeting starts.
I need to find out where Tom is right now.
What makes you think I want this?
You should've woken me up.
I wonder why Tom isn't hungry.
The cat scared me.
I told them not to tell you.
"Far from being pleased, my father is very angry."
I don't want to answer the question.
I don't even know if Tom is still alive.
That was what Tom wanted.
I was told you were an expert.
Tom found it difficult to please Mary.
Tom can't breathe on his own.
Would you like that?
Tom didn't want to stop.
Here's the file.
No one believed him.
You must be cautious.
I told Tom to stay here.
I never really trusted you.
Tom folded his shirts.
"It'll happen to you, too."
What's up with Tom?
Tom and Mary are waiting in the lobby.
They screamed.
He used the dictionary.
Tom is the reason I'm here today.
You need to talk to Tom in person.
The front brakes don't work.
Come early.
No one likes to do that.
"Mushrooms are in season now, so they are cheap."
Tom smiled and nodded.
I've already hidden the diamonds.
I wasn't sure you'd be happy to see me.
God bless you.
I got into trouble with the police for driving too fast.
I won't likely be home tomorrow.
Hold the elevator.
Tom is the only one who knows that.
Tom and Mary were the winners.
Ask them.
This'll be our secret.
I brought you some fruit.
He got up earlier than usual.
He comes from Wales.
I was very proud.
What kind of plant is it?
Are you sure you don't want me to go with you?
He said that he would be back right away.
Do you want to go fishing tomorrow?
We ran after the cat.
Does Tom have more money than you?
It was really cold.
You'll have to do that tomorrow.
I love hamburgers.
I haven't seen her for ages.
Tom abused our trust.
I am married and I have a daughter.
I slept in the car.
Stop ordering me around.
Tom knows how to help us.
The feud is over.
It's a curse.
I miss you.
They want our help.
Tom didn't take the medicine that the doctor prescribed.
I don't care about that.
Do you think we can get there in time?
How does your wife feel about it?
We all try to get together at least once a year.
Would you lend me a pencil?
The time for talking is over.
Nobody was listening to us.
I play the guitar.
We have a mutual friend.
Let me prove it.
Your bicycle is better than mine.
The student insulted the teacher.
Have you ever seen a whale?
We had a good time in the open air.
I don't know how Tom ever stood it.
Tom will succeed eventually.
All the students went home.
My shoulder is OK now.
The cat caught the mouse.
I've gotten divorced again.
This is so easy.
Tom didn't know where Mary wanted to spend her summer vacation.
I think you mentioned that last week.
There is no time for explanation.
It's warmer in the house. Let's go inside.
I'm going to ask Tom to help.
What would your father think?
I knew you wanted to show me something.
I appreciate everything you've done for us.
Tom said he knew what Mary wanted to do.
My greatest fear is drowning.
We'll make you happy.
"If you want something done right, do it yourself."
He has a sense of humor.
Tom walks home from work every day.
I needed to see you.
Mary has lost an earring.
Hand it over.
I'm surprised that Tom isn't here.
We need to get down to business.
I don't want to call the police.
It is 7:30.
She is a second-rate singer at best.
Did you warn Tom?
I wore a hat yesterday because it was very cold.
There was no water in the river.
What do you know about Tom that I don't?
I never liked you.
I'm glad you asked that.
That's what Tom said to Mary.
Tom bumped into Mary at the airport.
I feel like seeing you.
I don't like fish with lots of bones.
You helped Mommy?
Do you promise not to tell anyone else?
I know nothing about it.
My doctor told me that I needed to lose some weight.
"Strictly speaking, the earth is not round."
Is the dog chained?
Was that Tom you were just talking to?
I'm shy.
I wouldn't want to keep Tom waiting.
I know who you voted for.
When will you call?
You're too young to get married.
I need to go to work.
She asked me where I was going.
Which one is your favorite?
Tom is now taller than his father.
This is what Tom would do.
We didn't do that.
He is twice as heavy as his wife.
I'll punch your lights out!
I'll pay for this.
They are approaching.
"Tom is sitting next to Mary, isn't he?"
A year has twelve months.
So you decided to come after all.
Tom asked Mary to talk to John.
Tom is a bit snobbish.
Are you going to come back?
Tom said he wanted to do that again.
What's the correct answer?
The temperature fell several degrees.
We should've done this earlier.
Almost everyone I know knows how to swim.
Tom told me that Mary was very hungry.
I thought Tom wasn't at home.
How much did you pay for that?
Mary looks beautiful.
When was the last time you had a vacation?
He kept me from making a big mistake.
Tom didn't want you to do that.
I suspect Tom wasn't really surprised.
I have high hopes for Tom.
"Generally speaking, men are physically stronger than women."
Thousands of people went to the beach to see the dolphin.
Elephants are the world's largest land animals.
There's almost no milk in the glass.
I think Tom hasn't made a decision yet.
I'm not a big letter writer.
Do you want me to tell the truth?
That's quite meaningless.
How could you know?
I was out all day.
You'll have no choice.
Tom called Mary to tell her that he loved her.
I think about Tom all the time.
I am visiting my friends.
Tom should've been an actor.
Tell me why you did that.
Tom understands what you don't.
I have no idea why Tom wasn't here yesterday.
No one likes me.
Don't listen to that man.
We played poker the entire day.
"Don't hang up yet, please."
Tom just got back from the hospital.
I don't like him.
Tom said he's tired.
Somebody stole my car.
Tom said hello to Mary.
"I'm here, too."
I hope Tom survives.
She doesn't like this game.
Tom didn't want to do that either.
Do you consider this one of your best paintings?
I'm trying to figure out why the engine won't start.
I'm not sure I understand what you're trying to say.
I'm a very busy man.
This isn't my first time to drive a sports car.
Don't you ever speak to me like that again.
I'm not disorganized.
I saw my friends yesterday.
Smoking shortens your life.
Tom gave a short talk.
Didn't you know that Tom was dating Mary?
He started going bald quite young.
Tom can't have written this letter himself.
I'm so afraid.
I'm sure that was Tom.
I'm looking forward to meeting your parents.
I said I was busy.
The police left without finding anything.
Tom worked part-time.
Tom hid in the bushes.
I didn't think that Tom would hurt Mary.
I'm afraid we'll get nowhere doing it this way.
I love doing that.
He rescued a girl from drowning and was given a reward.
Tom has already been told he shouldn't do that.
Tom's palms were sweaty.
We don't need to go anywhere.
I wonder when the movie's going to start.
Just keep talking.
I didn't want to sit with Tom.
We failed.
How old is your mother?
Tom knows how to make almost anything.
Tom asked Mary for her advice.
Were you talking to me?
John is two years older than I am.
This flag is very pretty.
Tom wanted to study French.
I'll be in Boston next Monday.
This bed is too hard to sleep in.
I bought a good camera.
I was surprised that Tom said that.
Can I give you a ride home?
Tom shouldn't do that.
I let you down.
What's your favorite day of the week?
Tom almost never did that.
Tom is a ruthless businessman.
Tom's a drunk.
That gold ring belonged to my mother.
I think you will be impressed with the answers.
Tom earns three times more than I do.
I forgot that Cristina read English.
Tom didn't promise me anything.
"Look after the place while we're out, OK?"
Tom's ugly.
I'd like to help you if I can.
Is your school far from here?
I'm the one who rescued you.
Tom objected to being treated like a child.
School begins in April.
You're a good dancer.
Do you think it is still repairable?
The teacher was far from satisfied with the result.
I'm going to need some more money.
I won the race.
Tom declined to comment.
I've seen this movie twice.
I always listen to Tom.
They were all busy.
It's your fault that happened.
Tom wanted to name his daughter Mary.
He likes playing soccer.
He was moved to tears.
He goes abroad every year.
Everybody was listening intently to Tom.
Did Tom do what you asked him to do?
What do you want that for?
Tom pleaded guilty.
How many days were you there?
I can answer your question.
Tom fought his way through the flames and rescued the child from the burning house.
Tom's approach is somewhat different.
You can go to the station by bus.
Tom says I'm beautiful.
Let's all help Tom.
It is no use arguing with her.
Tom entered the building.
A butterfly is a mature caterpillar.
"The older we grow, the less we dream."
Tom didn't have job at that time.
The company is struggling for survival.
Tom said that Mary wasn't jealous.
Let me come in.
She guessed right.
You'll be asleep by the time your father gets home.
"Tom wanted to hit Mary, but John stopped him."
He likes sweets.
Tom pulled out his cell phone and made a call.
Tom has already been advised to do that.
Tom is going to lose everything.
Tom is smarter than you think.
I never get tired of this song.
Marilyn Monroe's success did not make her happy.
How much money did you steal?
When would you like to meet?
Just face the facts.
Tom only does that on weekends.
Come to my house.
Tom didn't do that a lot.
Tom just wants Mary to be happy.
The room is very cold. The fire has gone out.
I refuse to obey you any longer.
I took your advice.
I wanted to speak with you first.
How did you hurt your arm?
Do you want to hear my story or not?
Do you want to save them?
Tom spends all his free time with Mary.
The dogs seem happy.
This one's from me.
Tom told me I did that wrong.
Tom started it.
I don't remember that day.
You need good equipment to climb that mountain.
How much would you pay?
She fell into a deep sleep.
Tom never told me why he had decided to become a teacher.
Tom and Mary were both sitting cross-legged on the floor.
This work will be finished in a week.
"I'm fairly fluent in French, English and German."
Tom asked you a question. Please answer it.
I decided to call Tom.
It'd be better if you would come with me.
Tom is doing everything he can to save money.
Try once again.
What exactly are you trying to say?
Is that your idea?
Tom's delirious.
I thought you were a teacher.
We can't tell anyone about this.
They tried to cheer me up.
I checked twice.
You need to go there today.
I've loved you from the moment I saw you.
I want you to stay away from Tom.
What museums would you recommend I visit?
Tom decided to help Mary.
Tom has never won anything.
Tom is definitely having problems.
I won't do to Tom what he did to me.
How much sugar do you want?
I don't know if Tom understood what we were talking about or not.
I've never eaten rabbit meat.
I fell down on the ice.
You must go there immediately.
My guitar is in the trunk of Tom's car.
That's a very old song.
Self confidence is the key to success.
I'll save you a piece of cake.
I was an idiot to believe you.
It's not a bad deal.
You should've thought of that before.
You'd better go home.
You don't listen.
Are you saying Tom didn't have to do that?
Yoga can improve your posture.
I was going to go.
Did you know what Tom's plans were?
Tom was afraid of you.
The ticket is valid to April 29.
Are you here alone?
I'm sorry I did that.
I want to see you.
Please be home by three o'clock.
Tom wants revenge.
The exam was too difficult for me.
This is by far the best hotel in town.
They're going.
Tom wears thick-rimmed glasses.
You've known me thirty years.
Tom isn't in the mood for jokes.
I figured it was better not to go without you.
Is this what you wanted?
I haven't eaten since breakfast. I'm hungry.
You called?
When would Tom like to do that?
Tom is helping them.
I'm prejudiced.
This is not the entrance.
I got off at the wrong station.
I usually get what I want.
I think I'll take this one.
Tom told me he was going to kill you.
Do you always get what you want?
I'm divorced.
Take your elbows off the table.
I don't mind even if she doesn't come.
He is not the sharpest tool in the shed.
A taxi from the airport costs around thirty dollars.
We had to leave quickly.
I had to go to Boston last week.
I think you're the one who did that.
You gave me only fifty cents.
Which umbrella is yours?
He put his thoughts on paper.
Tom knew that he was irreplaceable.
You're very disorganized.
Where did we park?
I think we're almost done.
You have to trust me.
"It all happened so fast, I can't really explain it."
I'll always be your friend.
There are signs everywhere.
He is a bank clerk.
Tom sold it to me.
Have you been dating anyone else?
You can come back here anytime you want.
"Run, or else you'll be late."
We're both fine.
Her eyes are blue.
He is a waiter and also an actor.
Tom is winning the game.
Tom was standing in the middle of the road.
Is dinner ready?
I helped everybody.
We were grateful.
Tom handed his son a lollipop.
I'm almost certain that we have enough water.
Tom can't afford a new car.
Tom picked up the coin.
Do you really want Tom to leave?
Do you know someone who can help?
That's the silliest thing I've ever heard.
"I can defend myself, Tom."
The tumor was removed.
I'd like to have an answer.
I respect the elderly.
He gives me a phone call every now and then.
I didn't want to interfere.
Neither of us will do that.
Tom went with Mary.
Tom said that he would help.
Let me repair it.
She plays the piano.
I wasn't aware of the problems.
Don't leave this room.
Tom asked Mary to open the door.
Tom called her again.
There is a television in the room.
Tom is going to come home soon.
Tom can do that with his eyes closed.
I like clocks.
Tom asked us to help him move his piano.
I saw Tom a minute ago.
We want that to end.
Are those your pictures?
Let's take a trip.
I looked down at the sea.
Tom said that Mary was fat.
Which one was your favorite?
There is a problem.
Tom likes his coffee without sugar.
It is dangerous for children to go out alone at night.
I should've studied French.
Tom is out to get me.
I'll tell you later.
This is a boring movie.
I have a lot of neighbors.
I can't live without her.
Have I answered your question?
Refrigerators help to preserve food.
I don't want to make promises I can't keep.
I've known Tom for three years.
Tom recommended you for the job.
Show us the way.
Tom died in October at the age of 30.
I don't think that Tom knows that I'm here.
I want you to tell Tom what I said.
I stayed with Tom.
You look beautiful tonight.
Didn't you know that Tom isn't planning to do that?
I'm visiting a friend of mine in the hospital.
What do you mean?
I've managed to stop the bleeding.
I know exactly what I'm going to do.
You can't stop me.
Why did you stop me?
Something very strange is happening here.
I am not a morning person.
My mother speaks slowly.
Tom told us all a story.
She pushed him out the door.
You will need a key.
I still don't believe it!
I stayed at a nice hotel.
Tom doesn't know why Mary went to Boston.
You're not sick.
These items are rather hard to obtain.
"No, thank you. I'm just looking around."
Tom works for us.
I don't want to lose my job.
Tom and Mary always play tennis on Mondays.
Tom promised he wouldn't tell anyone.
Tom came to the party with a girl half his age.
I'm supposed to be at school today.
Their ship is still in port.
Tom gave me a hint.
He knows almost nothing about that animal.
You've got no right to talk to Tom that way.
I'm unhappy.
Why were you helping Tom?
Let me die.
He suddenly fell ill.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
"Why did you do that, and not Tom?"
I want to be rich.
You can keep this tape until tomorrow.
I lost my watch.
My parents don’t like the way I dress.
A scream broke the silence.
Don't bother Tom while he's reading.
Tom managed to escape through a window.
Take mine.
I knew you'd find me.
Tom has a steady job.
I really will have to study.
Tom backed up his data.
I didn't know what it meant at that time.
When can we start?
"Sister, don't let this patient out of your sight."
I know I shouldn't have eavesdropped.
I think Tom won't go to Boston with Mary.
I won the contest.
I thought Tom left.
I'm not asking you any questions.
Let me speak.
Tom almost forgot to take an umbrella with him.
Can I buy that for you?
How are we going to repair this?
She prayed for her son's return.
Tom is a doctor like his father is.
I'd do anything for Tom.
This table is missing a leg.
I saw myself in the mirror.
They were family.
I caught it.
I walked into the classroom.
Tom had no such problem.
I needed that money to buy a gift for Tom.
Tom told me to ask you.
Tom warned you.
They won't let Tom out.
He got well again.
I don't think it'll snow.
There are frequently earthquakes in Japan.
Can you replace Tom?
We agonized over what to do.
You'll suffer because of that.
What else do you know about that?
He gave me an example.
I helped Tom give his dog a bath.
Tom can fix it.
It's here.
I turned off my phone.
I love the way you laugh.
I need to quit doing this.
It's pretty common.
Someone did that already.
"If there hadn't been a split in the party just before elections, we'd have won."
I demand satisfaction.
We could sell that.
I was unable to look her in the face.
Now you're safe.
We often eat fish raw in Japan.
I'm going to give it a go.
Tell Tom it was a mistake.
That doesn't mean you shouldn't be careful.
Did I surprise you?
Tom put the bowl into the microwave.
Tom is very polite.
Everybody seeks happiness.
I'm glad to be home.
Tom understood why Mary hated him.
I saw you talking to Tom earlier.
Tom told Mary he was married.
Why do I have to sing with Tom?
I just want to get home safe and sound.
Tom gave Mary permission to drive his car.
I want to know where you are now.
Give me the key.
You should win today.
She called me a taxi.
I don't fear them.
Tom's eyesight isn't as good as it used to be.
I think it's time for me to spend a little time with my children.
Tom had a watch.
Nobody knew that Tom couldn't speak French.
Did you show it to Tom?
This didn't cost too much.
I had no idea what I was looking for.
Someone stole Tom's wallet.
This is a sign.
I don't eat pears.
Tom is just trying to protect Mary.
This carpet was a real bargain.
Who wants to go to the park?
I don't even know why I did that.
You've never told me about that.
Will you be finished by 2:30?
These are my students.
I'm taking this to Tom.
Tom is a former firefighter.
I have two cousins.
You must be careful when you drive a car.
Tom said he found a wallet in the back seat.
"In my room, there are no clocks."
Tom will be here tomorrow.
Tom said you'd come.
Write down Tom's address for Mary.
Do you remember what Tom said?
"Anyway, you don't have to worry."
We have some.
Get a doctor.
The cake didn't turn out well because the flour was past its use-by date.
I don't think that anyone will like Tom.
I've always admired your patience.
She plays tennis in the morning.
Keep an eye on the girls.
It's no bigger than a golf ball.
I don't care who does this.
Do you know Tom's blood type?
Tom doesn't know how to start a lawn mower.
Tom rarely agrees with me.
God exists.
"Tom likes Boston, doesn't he?"
Are you sick?
Do you want another cup of tea?
Remove your shirt and lie down.
He looks good for his age.
Didn't you know Tom was rich?
It's really bad for your eyes.
It's a pity we can't stay.
What's that strange smell coming from the kitchen?
She has gone abroad.
Tom got to work late.
I've always wanted to live in Australia.
Who were you talking with?
Did Tom hurt anyone?
Tom is a freshman.
"Tom didn't do it, did he?"
Do you prefer tea or coffee?
Tom can't bring himself to say no.
Tom was there all the time.
The manager's business is to adjust all complaints of the customers.
When did they go home?
She could feel her knees shaking.
You're such an idiot!
No one voted for you.
Has this ever happened to you?
He was the last person I had expected to see during my stay in America.
I want to go by air if possible.
Tom was drinking at a bar with Mary at the time the police think that John was murdered.
It's time to change.
Tom is a woman hater.
Who will look after the baby while they're out?
Tom took off his belt.
You can't stop me now.
I wouldn't buy that if I were you.
I don't know why Tom hates Mary.
He had a little operation on his left leg.
"You're the expert here, Tom."
Today's my daughter's birthday.
"Of course, we believe you."
I just can't understand this.
I knew Tom wouldn't kiss you.
My best friend comes from Canada.
Strange things happen.
I think Tom was born in Australia.
Is it OK if I call you Tom?
I tried.
I cried on his shoulder.
Take it upstairs.
Tom enjoyed doing that.
How did your day go?
I don't think Tom knows how much Mary loves him.
I was foolish enough to believe him.
Tom speaks some French.
You're the worst basketball coach this team has ever had.
Did you want to speak to me?
Can you imagine what our life would be like without electricity?
I know what you did last night.
How's your son?
I'd like you to meet with Tom.
I've just arrived.
Tom was arrested in Boston yesterday afternoon.
I don't live alone.
How did you reply?
I'm not listening to you.
I think you know what Tom's girlfriend's name is.
Tom may have told Mary about it.
Who got hurt?
Who's your favorite soccer player?
That's the hotel.
I love my father.
Tom wants me to quit this job.
I'm tired.
"Apart from the cost, the dress doesn't suit me."
Tom can't be much older than I am.
I want to go abroad next year.
I still don't know what I should do.
Do you want a boiled egg for breakfast?
I never was shy.
It's more difficult than you think.
I think you're going to make it.
I don't think Tom is ready.
I hope you're hungry.
You're conceited.
They disputed the ownership of the land for years.
We have to try.
We wish to speak to you.
I don't want you to leave.
Do you think that's funny?
There is insufficient light for reading.
Tom didn't have to explain anything.
Tom gently hugged Mary.
Were you attentive?
I'll be really careful.
I will do whatever you ask.
How long have you been sick?
I asked what was wrong.
I hope you agree.
What're you guys looking for?
Tom was ruthless.
I think Tom is almost thirty now.
That would be fun.
I truly apologize.
We'll be in Boston for another three weeks.
I told you I loved you.
I'm proud of you.
Spiders scare me.
The keys were in my bag.
Did you break the window on purpose or by accident?
Ants work hard all summer.
I have a cat.
Tom bought a Persian rug.
What was it made of?
It was very crowded on the bus.
I'm sick of this place.
What're you reading?
This radio is out of order.
"You'll be busy tomorrow, won't you?"
Close the box.
You have said quite enough.
What we need is some more time.
Our money ran out.
I want a piece of candy.
Don't you understand what's going on here?
The price of gold fluctuates daily.
I don't want you to go back.
What time does the first train leave?
Tom knew he was wrong.
The police arrested three men.
How often do you wash your towels?
Tom apologized and left.
I asked where she lived.
I used to wash my hair only once a week.
I know Tom is usually polite.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
I think it's Tom's motorcycle.
Tom isn't a student.
Chocolate ice cream is my favorite dessert.
I'd like to believe we learn from our mistakes.
This one is much better.
Tom was surprised by Mary's question.
I am 19 years old.
Don't laugh at my failure.
They got it wrong.
My name is third on the list.
My mother takes a bath every other day.
Tom put his clothes on.
The reasons are understandable.
"Strictly speaking, there were some mistakes in his speech."
Think what you want.
This is the hat Tom bought for me.
How can it affect them?
Could you call Tom?
Did you ever tell anybody about what happened?
We'll have to build a pen for the pigs.
You should've done it yourself.
I do hope that it won't rain tomorrow.
Tom doesn't wear jeans every day.
I envy him.
Tom was injured in a car accident.
I gasped.
I heard a noise.
Is Tom an actor?
I had never seen a giraffe till I visited the zoo.
Open the gate.
She wasn't able to talk to him.
I think that would help.
I think so.
Tom says he isn't sure he's ready.
He climbed the stairs.
Who'll be there?
I'd like to study in Boston.
I don't think that I can do this without you.
Was he home alone?
I hate his parents.
I knew you knew the answer.
Do you want to take a look at it?
Tom was walking.
I was hungry.
I want a girlfriend.
I know it's illegal.
This was too much for Tom.
I'm just joking.
Where did you find their cat?
You can make your own.
This story is based on actual events.
Have there been any phone calls for me?
I didn't expect that to come from you.
Our country has always had friendly relations with yours.
It's a myth.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
Does anybody want a beer?
That wasn't my intention.
You are what you are.
What happened to Tom?
Don't worry. I can fix it.
I didn't really know what I was doing.
Which one do you like most?
Tom won't leave Boston.
Tom wondered the same thing.
Tom bought his son a sports car.
I knew about this three weeks ago.
"It's my fault, not yours."
Tom took some coins out of his pocket.
They're new.
Tom handed Mary a beer.
I have a lot of money.
I thought Tom was a friend of yours.
Are you in pain?
Tom says he doesn't want to live like this anymore.
Didn't you know that Tom is in Australia now?
He forgot to turn off the light.
I don't want to look younger.
Tom tried on the wig.
They went shopping.
I've already done everything Tom has asked me to do.
I thought that you lived by yourself.
It's likely to take much longer than you think it will.
Flying a kite can be dangerous.
Aren't you convinced?
That is mine. I don't know where yours is.
The cat went through a gap in the fence.
I don't eat that much.
Would you like to have a bath before going to bed?
I shouldn't have stayed up late yesterday.
Don't talk to me like that.
I'll be gone until Monday.
What are your conditions?
I'm glad you reminded me.
I want to join the army.
He has more than five dictionaries.
I'm still thinking.
I'm sorry I'm calling you at work.
Are you afraid of it?
You don't have to snap at me like that.
Is that not possible anymore?
I know that Tom is busy today.
Are you in a good mood?
I seldom win.
Everyone except Tom ate pizza.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I'm to blame.
You have a guest.
"What's wrong? ""I don't have a key."""
It is very cold outside. You'll catch a cold without a coat.
I'm not used to speaking in public.
It's getting dark outside.
I wish I hadn't told Tom about what happened.
Tom wondered whether honesty really was the best policy.
Mary has lost her purse.
I warned you not to come here.
Will you look after my dog while I am away?
Tom did it for fun.
I'm an archaeologist.
Tom didn't want to go out.
Please move.
I love baseball.
When did you return?
Tell Tom that Mary wants to see him.
Can I take a message?
It's good you were able to come.
Don't forget that it's Tom's birthday tomorrow.
Who can that be?
Did you like my picture?
I was surprised when I heard Tom and Mary had gotten married.
Has Tom cleaned his room yet?
Do you see Tom often?
Do I have to wear a tie at work?
My parents never allowed me to do anything.
"Tom was a good friend, and I'll miss him."
Did you buy tomatoes?
The museum is closed for renovations.
You will live longer if you don't smoke.
"She wanted to return home, but she got lost."
I told the police all I know.
I'd like to buy this doll.
I didn't know what to do with it.
"Be sure to do that, OK?"
It'd be better if you didn't come today.
They know our plans.
I don't think this is for you.
"Now, wait a minute."
It's not always like that.
Are your feet cold?
Remind me to give this to Tom.
Tom enlisted in the service.
I'm going to find out what's going on.
Did you see the solar eclipse yesterday?
The doll lay on the floor.
Why don't they like me?
I completely forgot.
I don't think it's going to be easy to do that.
I hate myself.
I am no match for him.
Tom ate breakfast by himself.
You're weird.
You don't seem to be drunk.
Does anyone know where we can find a ladder?
I picked up some French.
I think Tom is afraid.
Tom doesn't know how to milk a cow.
He put a hand gently on her shoulder.
Women hate me.
I'd be surprised if Tom didn't do that.
I hope you understand.
Maybe we could make a deal.
I slept late and I missed the first train.
Tom didn't even look at Mary.
I'm used to being ignored by my parents.
Are you really not going?
What was that like?
We're not millionaires.
Tom heard a loud splash behind him.
You will have to study harder next year.
How long are you going to stay here?
I'm really not much of a guitarist.
You're a beautiful girl.
Who was in your car?
We were all stunned.
She's wearing a hat.
Salt is used to thaw ice.
Tom and Mary hit it off from the beginning.
This is the worst hotel in town.
You don't have to eat.
I want you to teach Tom how to drive.
Why didn't you help Tom?
I heard a call for help.
How disgusting!
Not all baby animals are cute.
Tom is brushing his teeth.
"If you go, I'll go, too."
I wanted to return to your village.
We're on time.
Let's have a pillow fight.
"Life being very short, you ought not to waste your time."
We'll call Tom.
You deserve it more than I do.
I'm very poor.
I fell into a hole.
Tom is a well-known lawyer.
Tom is a voice actor.
Tom is in his mid thirties.
Go wake Tom up and tell him that breakfast is ready.
Tom didn't want Mary to get a tattoo.
It's become dark. Would you turn on the light?
Tom needs to update his website.
Does Tom have everything he needs?
I think Tom isn't Canadian.
"By the way, have you ever been to Europe?"
I think you'd better go on a diet.
My grandfather predeceased my great-grandfather.
I don't think I'll ever understand.
Tom knocked louder.
An increase in customer complaints could signal a decline in business.
Tom is trying not to worry too much.
Tom was breathing.
I always tell the truth.
You're my enemy.
Would you come over here?
I'd like to go with you.
You can wait here.
Tom did it easily.
You saved my life.
Do what your father tells you.
I never knew Tom.
I'm sure I can persuade Tom.
Do you want to go for a walk?
Welcome to your new home.
I can't stand those kinds of people.
Your idea is not entirely crazy.
She called to tell him that she'd be late.
I told Tom you were coming.
Who told you I would be here?
The ice in the water melted.
Did you ask Tom to stop?
Where are you going now?
The Zugspitze is Germany's highest mountain.
Let's go have a beer.
You should pay more attention to your own safety.
I was there that day.
"Tom, don't leave."
It's going to blow up!
Some things are better not said.
I didn't realize you were Canadian.
Tom is Mary's downstairs neighbor.
I'm glad Tom wasn't fired.
How does Tom know about that?
They released all the prisoners.
Both of us want to do that.
What's your lucky number?
You're younger than me.
What exactly did you ask Tom?
Did you really think I wasn't going to help?
I wish I had wings to fly.
Which Harry Potter book is your favorite?
I like you just the way you are.
You can't sell our piano!
Help us a little.
"After he heard the news, Tom was in seventh heaven."
"If I don't go, who will?"
I know that Tom is old.
Just do what I tell you to do.
Can you find out?
Tom showed me the letter from Mary.
Tom tried solving the problem.
I'm not giving you any money.
Tom will help me clean my room.
What do you have for breakfast?
Who threw the bottle?
I can't live alone.
"Good night, Tom."
I saw Liz this morning.
They're both laughing.
I don't want to tell Tom how old I am.
I don't think that Tom really needed to do that.
So where are you guys going?
I can't forgive you.
How did you get so strong?
"If you eat so much, you'll get sick."
"If I gave you three hundred dollars, what would you spend it on?"
Everybody knew.
There were no fingerprints on the knife.
Don't give it to him. Give it to me.
Tom refused to help Mary.
You can't have left it at the airport.
Tom started to cough.
Even adults do a lot of stupid things.
Are you going to help me find it?
I have three more pages to go.
I didn't say you could go.
I'm waiting for your letter.
They play together a lot.
"If you knew, you'd tell me, right?"
I asked Tom what he thought.
They don't know yet.
"Although Tom is sick, he's swimming."
Tom has been infected.
I want to leave early.
I don't know how to answer your question.
I didn't lie.
Did you hear about what happened to Tom?
I'll drive you there.
"It doesn't really make much sense, does it?"
Tom smiled innocently.
You should've come sooner.
I don't want a banana.
I'm not home.
Who's the lawyer handling the suit?
You'll be missed by your friends.
I think they saw us.
I wouldn't have been able to do it without you.
Did you vote?
I don't know why Tom called me.
My wife is having a baby.
Ask Tom to come to Boston.
"After slapping Tom, Mary ran out of the room."
Tom sent me a message.
I don't think I should eat this.
I was very busy yesterday.
Did Tom lay a hand on you?
I've seen your driver's license.
There are holes in the heels of these socks.
Tom finally gave up smoking.
What has brought you to this city?
You look pleased.
You know I respect you.
Give me the details.
Why don't you go outside?
I'm sure she will become a great singer.
I'll never forget what you've done for me.
He caught a big fish.
How's your wife?
It's only a question of time.
He could not believe his ears.
I remember what she said.
It appears that my mother knows the fact.
Are you leaving now?
I told Tom how much money I needed.
He had jeans on.
I need those shoes.
Do you want some raisins?
I don't know whether I will have time to do it.
There must be an explanation.
The money is at your disposal.
Do you know what kind of tree that is?
Can I give you some advice?
Tom died of hunger.
What do we know about Tom?
You overestimate him.
That's what they're looking for.
Tom moved to Australia about three years ago.
I've told you a million times not to exaggerate.
He is always reading.
What did you do with my book?
I won fair and square.
I've always helped Tom.
She has two sisters.
We didn't want to do that.
Tom is absolutely right.
Where did you see it?
Aren't you hungry?
I didn't know Tom was married.
Are we ready for this?
Where is the exit?
I feel horrible.
A moment's doubt can cost a pilot his life.
Can you drive a car?
Would Tom be able to do that?
I have no alibi.
I will get married this year.
Nobody will stop us.
Could you bring me a glass of water?
Tom didn't understand a thing.
I come from a long line of doctors.
I can't believe Tom betrayed me.
Tom doesn't go swimming very often.
My father gave a nice watch to me.
Why don't you leave?
You looked lovely.
Tom didn't buy any bread.
Don't lose your patience.
Do the police have any suspects?

I don't know what Tom meant.
Do you think anybody would care if we didn't do that?
I baited the hook.
No one had to wait.
I'll go and tell Tom the good news.
She began to sing.
I'll be very careful.
The most dangerous beast is the beast within.
"Tom is having problems here, isn't he?"
He will be studying when you get up.
The room was filled with computers.
"I would go with you, but I don't have any money."
He knows how to pluck a chicken.
"Without your help, I would have failed."
I saw everything.
You were adopted.
I want to go to Australia one more time before my passport expires.
I told Tom to come here tomorrow at 2:30.
"Tom works hard, and so does Mary."
Somebody might've overheard your conversation with Tom.
Tom and his wife adopted a girl.
We got her to attend to the patient.
Do you by any chance have some aspirin?
The children were asleep upstairs.
We painted the house green.
It's been three years since Tom has been to visit us.
This is a dog that resembles a horse.
I'm so tired that I'm going to bed as soon as I get home.
We won't let Tom die.
Tom has information that Mary needs.
Tom works more diligently now.
"If you are not firm with the children, they will get out of hand."
"I don't want to do this, but you leave me no choice."
I wish you would start calling me Tom.
Don't forget to turn off the light before you go to sleep.
Go and wake Tom up.
Tom says he can't ignore the smell any longer.
The thief escaped through the window.
How did Tom learn French?
We've got nothing in common.
Just tell me what it is.
Send it to me.
"Since I didn't eat anything for breakfast, I'm very hungry now."
Tell Tom when you're ready.
Where did that happen?
I have big eyes.
How did you know where Tom was?
I'll give you whatever you want.
We waited outside.
Have you used it yet?
They stood on the top of the hill.
I've lost my pencil.
Tom wrote Mary right back.
Reduce the size of your portions.
I want Tom to understand why he has to leave.
I spend less money on clothes than my sister does.
She looked around.
Why didn't they come back?
Please write with a pencil.
I go to bed at ten every day.
Tom will probably be afraid of Mary's dog.
I will have finished reading this book by Tuesday.
I don't have any children.
We can't trust them now.
Have you ever lived in a rural area?
Tom is going to go with you.
Do I really have to give a speech?
Tom had to go himself.
This seems suspicious to me.
"Take the one you like best, whichever it is."
Don't tell Tom I did that.
Why do you want to kill me?
I couldn't sleep.
The garden was surrounded by a wooden fence.
Red wine goes well with meat.
Tom thought he could win.
Some friends invited me to dinner.
I wrote you three letters.
Would that be fair?
Tom killed a tiger.
I never trusted them.
I had never seen Tom act like that before.
You are a pretty girl.
Tom is now in the kitchen.
What time shall I pick you up?
It's like magic.
Didn't you know that Tom is from Boston?
Tom has a scar on his right leg.
I know Tom doesn't know who I am.
Is Tom asleep?
I feel very ill.
"For some reason, they didn't include my name on the list."
Tom won't bother you again.
We use words in order to communicate.
Tom wanted to write something.
Tom said that you wouldn't do that.
She rides a motorcycle well.
You should take her illness into consideration.
Does Tom have a key?
I'm three years older than you.
We can't count on Tom.
Some countries make voting compulsory.
Won't you tell me?
Tom's doctor told him to quit smoking.
I know that you love me.
I'm considering going back to Boston.
Maybe they will come and maybe they won't.
Tom didn't want to go there.
Tom saw John and Mary holding hands.
The traffic accident prevented me from catching the train.
Why do you need money?
Tom could go to jail for this.
I think you're going to like it.
You're a fraud.
"Although he is over 70, he is still active."
When was the last time you did the dishes?
What were you doing at the hospital?
How are you able to remain so optimistic?
"I saw Tom sitting at the bar alone, drinking wine."
I like to read.
I have few friends.
Do you really want to know the truth?
How long have you been traveling?
It's time for you to go to bed.
I think I can speak French well enough to say pretty much anything I want to say.
I'll probably be able to do that.
I swear I'll never do such a thing.
He told his children not to make so much noise.
He is off today.
We really want to impress Tom.
Have lunch with me.
That amount of food will last them for a week.
You're the smartest one in our class.
We hit the jackpot.
Keep walking.
"After this, Miki was taken to the hospital."
I'd like to stay here with Tom.
He doesn't want to see you.
The hen has laid an egg.
It could be anybody.
I believe that we can do it.
My brother and I share the same room.
Tom told me he was ready to go.
She took him to the zoo.
This department store is closed today.
I've never understood Tom.
Is this cup clean?
Tom took off his watch.
I never stopped loving you.
I'm really very sorry.
Tom looks kind of tired.
Tom is a really nice man.
I don't have the money to buy it.
Tom collects guns.
You need to find your own way.
You're twice as old as me.
I didn't know I'd be back.
I'll read both books.
Which one would you choose?
Why would anyone want to hurt Tom?
Mary is a fairy princess.
I have to leave.
Tom wasn't being completely honest.
Tom helped Mary clean up.
Didn't you know that Tom was in Australia last week?
Tom doesn't seem to know a lot about Mary.
Tom couldn't find Mary's house.
You're not that old.
Is Tom that good?
I'm glad Tom is OK.
Tom says he'll only talk to you.
Tom showed some pictures to Mary.
Are you absolutely sure of that?
Tom didn't have shoes on.
The surgeon amputated the wrong leg.
You look like you're satisfied.
The frost will ruin the crop.
Now look what I've done.
Tom has got nobody.
He raised the glass to his lips and drained it at one gulp.
I don't know exactly how that happened.
Tom is wearing a coat that is too large for him.
I'll have to wait.
I just want to stay in the car.
Tom will do it.
I've lost my watch.
I stayed up late last night.
That's going to cause some problems.
No way!
I'm in love with you already.
I'm sure you deserved it.
I felt sorry for you.
They brush their teeth twice a day.
I didn't know it at the time.
Tom said that he was safe.
Tom runs very fast.
It takes about ten minutes to boil an egg.
Will you lend me your pencil?
I can't go back.
I bought it for ten dollars.
What is it you do?
I owe Tom 300 dollars.
Will you still be here when I come back?
"I didn't know that Tom does that, too."
Keep smiling.
I haven't noticed any problems.
I shouldn't even be telling you this.
Please read it once more.
He works in a call center.
I still need to check with Tom.
Get real!
I warned you what would happen if you did that.
This is unusual weather.
Tom doesn't want to be left alone.
Please come into the room.
Why have you brought me here?
Nobody answered the phone.
I like it a lot.
What experience do you have in this field?
Tom doesn't like punk rock.
The fridge is empty.
Is your room as big as mine?
Do you study French?
Tom never asks anyone for help.
You're not as tall as I am.
One year is not enough to visit all the places in Kyoto.
I don't think that you'll be disappointed.
That cheese is made from goat's milk.
I want you to tell me everything you know about Tom.
I'm not accusing anybody of anything.
Not everybody does that.
When does your new store open?
What would you have me do?
What're you doing?
What's the commotion about?
Do come and visit us.
Call her tomorrow.
I gave my permission.
It was night.
I really loved you.
Would you tell the head chef that it was very delicious?
Tom washed his face.
You were the one who told me that.
I think we'll find Tom.
Tom arrived at the station at 3:00.
These lemons are fresh.
This boy is lazy.
Tom got into Mary's car.
You're a person.
He wasn't about to pass up that once-in-a-lifetime chance.
Tom woke up at 6:30.
Tom lives in our neck of the woods.
Do you want me to throw it away?
"As long as you have hope, a chance remains."
Tom studies all the time.
We need to tell Tom everything.
Can we really afford it?
Where did this come from?
They fixed the sign to the wall.
We didn't go to Boston.
I'd like you to help me.
I don't remember you.
We've got to help them.
Were you busy yesterday?
Tom is autistic.
Remember to see him tomorrow.
Can you hold this for a second?
The museum is closed Sundays.
Tom had no idea why.
Can I stay here?
We need to wait for Tom.
"If I knew anything, I'd tell you."
We have to always be ready.
I'll be back right away.
I'm married.
You have to overcome the difficulties.
Tom crumpled up the paper and threw it in the trashcan.
What does he expect in return?
I think you owe me some money.
How long have you been dating?
I've been trying to reach you all day.
Skiing is my passion.
Tom told Mary that she shouldn't do that.
Does Tom know you love Mary?
Is there a telephone here?
Try it once again.
I admit that I've been careless.
I don't think that Tom knows how to play the saxophone.
Do you want me to go now?
We really hope that you'll be there.
Tom thinks Mary should apologize to John.
Tom slid a little closer to Mary on the couch.
I broke it.
I didn't want to go to Tom and Mary's wedding.
Nobody sang with me.
You better sleep.
I like dogs very much.
Tom bought a camera for 500 dollars.
Tom gave me this tie.
Didn't you know that Tom didn't need to do that?
I knew what you were going to say.
Tom admitted that he killed Mary.
I didn't say Tom was smart.
"If you have nothing to do, why not read a book?"
I was the one who told Tom to do that.
"One day, Tom will understand."
That's why I came back.
I like women but I don't get along with them.
This is obscene.
Has he arrived yet?
The water is crystal clear.
The school is only a five-minute walk away.
That isn't what I said.
Can you play the clarinet?
Are you going to a movie?
Boston is one of the cities I visited last year.
Tom has his sweater on backwards.
I haven't been following the news lately.
He got married three days ago.
Tom's French is better than mine.
She found him handsome.
He must finish his homework today.
I think you know that.
I'm not sick.
That's our house.
Tom had no food.
This is an international community.
It is impolite to elbow one's way through the crowd.
Do you know what just happened?
Why are you in my house?
Do you really believe in magic?
"Hey, open the door."
A trip to Hawaii will cost you about 200 dollars.
He's not a liar.
Let's try to help Tom.
There is no choice.
When was the last time you fasted?
I wish I hadn't left early.
I need to ask you for a favor.
Tom and I'll go with Mary.
I'm glad you came today.
How come you're here?
Tom is finally here.
Mary is Tom's step-sister.
It's now time for you to go home.
The heroine of this story is a little girl.
Choose one from among these.
He organized a summer rock festival.
I bought a cat at that shop.
When will I get paid?
This film is worth seeing.
The audience consisted mainly of students.
Tom found this under his car.
Tom seems disappointed.
Tom sat on a bench smoking a cigarette.
My grandmother has gray hair.
Tom has come here to help us.
There was nothing more we could do.
Their dreams came true.
I read in the newspaper that he had been murdered.
"When the police entered the room, they found Tom tied to a chair."
You have many enemies.
The enemy attacked us at night.
I've already told you I'm not going to do that.
Tom doesn't like working alone.
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn't ever see Alice again.
No one moved.
Do you have any good news?
Tom needs a little more practice.
My friends invited me to dinner.
Tom hasn't said a word all evening.
I saw Tom three different times today.
Is your name really Tom?
Tom still hasn't shaved.
I wanted to be an architect.
I wanted to stop Tom.
How can I make Tom stop?
Tom didn't know all the facts.
The thermometer says it's thirty degrees.
Tom isn't scared of snakes.
"Unfortunately, Tom did that."
I think there are a lot of beautiful women in Australia.
I work all day long.
I need some time.
They can't swim.
Tom thinks he's a good singer.
Which way are you heading?
"Tom picked up his rifle, aimed and fired."
Someone's knocking.
Let's talk about your family.
Are you sure it'll work?
I haven't seen any of his pictures.
I need some hairpins and bobby pins.
Tom isn't as shy as I am.
You'll get over this.
Are you hungry?
Remove the lamp from the table.
Why was everyone surprised?
I need the car keys.
I just told Tom to leave Mary alone.
This is our secret weapon.
Tom ended up behind bars.
I'm tired.
Go and help your brother.
Where do you go on Monday evenings?
It isn't contagious.
I begged her not to go.
Nobody likes a wise guy.
Tom does things that I wouldn't do.
I don't know what that word means.
Tom and Mary were close friends.
He is the best for this project.
Solar panels don't work at night.
I'll save you a seat in the front row.
Every ship needs a captain.
Who wants a piece of cake?
They saw something odd.
She goes to the bookstore once a week.
Tom might not be lying.
Tom sat down on the floor.
Do you see that?
Wasn't he your boyfriend?
I won't tolerate any sloppiness.
Tom knows how to talk to children.
Something very weird happened to Tom.
Slander is a crime.
Tom didn't want to do anything.
Do you know what's happening?
I can't believe this is real.
You don't have to follow my advice.
I think you know Tom.
It would be a good idea if you apologized to Tom.
Tom is already up.
Tom says he's not guilty.
Don't be so slow.
I hope they found a cure.
Tom hardly ever listens to music.
She has made the same mistake as last time.
Why didn't you stop Tom?
Didn't you know Tom was in Boston last year?
Tom and Mary are still young.
Tom and I are traveling together.
Tom knew I was hungry.
Tom was wearing a red headband.
He's at home right now.
It's time to wrap it up.
Don't go above the speed limit.
Tom died in 2013 in Boston.
I'm back online.
Why did you learn French?
Tom is afraid it'll happen again.
A fire broke out near my house.
How dare you insult my sister!
I try to keep a low profile.
I'll cut your head off!
Tom likes hot curry.
Do me a favor and talk to Tom.
Tom didn't even notice.
Come this way.
It's not my problem anymore.
Can I take pictures here?
Tom waited for Mary for three hours.
Our house was built in 2013.
It doesn't matter now.
The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
Don't ask me for help.
Where did Tom sleep last night?
It is difficult to believe what you say.
Tom doesn't want to work for Mary.
I would like to repay him for his kindness.
I don't totally understand that.
Tom and I are good friends.
Both sisters are pretty.
A lot of people are lazy.
Some people read the newspaper while watching television.
I know you're unlikely to ever forgive me.
Tom wasn't rude.
Tom wants to learn how to play the bassoon.
Do you love your country?
Who are the people I saw her with?
I don't know that word.
We see each other at the supermarket now and then.
I used to be thin.
He committed an illegal act.
Tom won't do it.
Did you know that?
Does Tom speak French fluently?
I didn't expect to find you here.
"English is studied in China, too."
I'll check your vision.
Most of the town was sleeping.
I want you to hug Tom.
It's time for you to go.
Do you have any objections?
Would you do that if you had the chance?
We had a lot of fun at the dance.
A woman without a man is nothing.
How do you like your new class?
Our marriage is over.
I didn't want Tom to worry.
It's just the tip of the iceberg.
Tom wants to eat lunch now.
I consider Tom to be my best friend.
I have been working here for ten years.
I'd like to live in Europe.
I closed the book.
I told you that I was going to do it.
Drinking on an empty stomach is bad for your health.
I forgot my password.
Why is this computer so slow?
Everybody knows that she can speak English well.
It must be nice to have friends in high places.
Don't tell anyone I was here.
What are they doing?
Can I kiss you again?
I have no idea what this means.
Europe is in crisis.
Have you received an answer from Tom?
I don't want to get my hands dirty.
Where's the truck?
I think Tom might have poisoned himself.
I'm not suggesting you go alone.
I believe it will be snowing tomorrow.
Why didn't you just tell me what it was?
Tom said he felt fine.
You're patient.
There are discrepancies.
What do you do exactly?
I managed to acquire two tickets for the concert.
I don't think that Tom can be left alone.
They were hungry.
Have you ever tasted such a good soup?
I had an accident.
I have a wife.
I was tired so I went to bed.
Do you want me to decide?
Do you really think we can do that?
My sister is too young to go to school.
One of my favorite spices is cinnamon.
A cat has seven lives.
I don't have time to do the laundry.
Tom currently lives in Australia.
He had a radio.
I don't think Tom has much money in the bank.
Tom was detained for questioning.
Tom apologized for what he did.
I don't remember the last time I climbed a tree.
There's nothing wrong with you.
How can you not like him?
Tom has a whole pile of unpaid parking tickets.
Let's talk about this again tomorrow.
I'm a third grader.
I have to meet him.
I don't believe in fairy tales.
We want to run a few tests.
He told me to meet him at his house.
They moved a year ago.
I thought you'd never ask.
Tom was drunk and forgot where he'd parked his car.
Tom filled out the application for me.
What we did was a mistake.
Don't talk to Tom about it.
Tom doesn't know you have a car.
I think Tom knows why.
The total is approximately ten thousand dollars.
Tom said he left a message.
"That sounds weird, but it's true."
Tom seemed surprised when I told him about it.
He writes to me once in a while.
This isn't drinking water.
Tom met Mary on the way home from where he worked part-time after school.
Tom is a very good basketball coach.
I wasn't surprised when Tom told me he didn't have to do that.
It's cold out here.
We're hoping to open in October.
He has a very interesting book.
I made coffee.
The sun is bright.
Mary fell in love with a handsome cowboy.
I'm adventurous.
He is above suspicion.
Give me back my bag.
Did anyone see where I left my glasses?
Why does Tom have to go?
Put the money in the bank.
Tom has been skipping classes.
Have you ever read Gulliver's Travels?
How do you know all that stuff?
Let's take a short break.
I'm the oldest one here.
I can speak French fairly well.
You're supposed to meet Tom in front of his hotel in about an hour.
Everybody's told me I can't trust you.
You have no authority to do that.
She asked him for help.
Tom told me everything was ready.
I've never spoken to Tom.
I've been sued.
Don't flatter yourself.
You look like you're tired.
Tom isn't a citizen of Australia.
I'm not very particular about food.
Tom will explain later.
Tom is expecting me.
That would help.
We were one big happy family.
I wanted Tom to tell me about his childhood.
He may have missed the last train.
I almost believed what Tom said.
Let me see.
I'm glad you could come. Please make yourself at home.
Have you put on sunscreen?
Tom found new evidence.
I think you're completely right.
How many left-handed people do you know?
Tom knows how much Mary loves him.
Why won't you be here tomorrow?
She got over the shock of her father's death.
Do you have any employees who speak French?
I think Tom isn't very happy.
"I like French, too."
Someone needs to talk to Tom about what happened.
Send us a letter.
The damage is done.
We may be late for school.
Why did you buy such an expensive car?
"Wherever you say, Tom."
Tom is doing that already.
I won't tell you where Tom is.
I thought about you a lot.
What did you tell Tom exactly?
I may need your help tomorrow.
I don't snore.
Tom answered me with a smile.
Don't ask me such difficult questions.
Tom couldn't remember where he put his sunglasses.
The owl gave a loud screech.
Do you want me to lock the door?
Tom hasn't asked Mary to do that.
I thanked them both.
Is there any hope whatsoever?
I know that Tom doesn't know when I want to do that.
Help me take this apart.
I know that you're hungry.
I think we've found the problem.
The boy started crying.
Was Tom the one who told you who to give that to?
We'll scream.
Why aren't you taking notes?
Tom has started taking French lessons.
I wasn't the one who told Tom to leave.
I think you should tell Tom the truth.
Tom has recovered.
I don't think this is the end.
I don't blame them for this.
He's good.
I wanted you to win.
It happened completely by accident.
Thanks for asking that question.
Tom and Mary have never played tennis together.
How do you know it was Tom who broke the window?
I asked Tom to hurry.
Put your back into it.
They relaxed.
She needs you.
I'm a third grader.
How many employees do you have?
Do you think Tom has enough money to buy that?
Tom asked a few questions.
You've grown fat.
I came here for that reason.
It's just a question of how much time it's going to take.
I really have to go now.
Tom doesn't believe that Mary is happy.
You never ask.
All Tom's jokes fell flat.
I will help as much as I can.
I was the one who said we should wait.
I did that in three hours.
What do you want us to do?
I'm not sure how long this will take.
You have my support.
I don't know who you want to meet.
Tom never wanted to live in Boston.
The ice gave way under his weight.
I have three friends who can speak French.
It's nothing to be sorry about.
Do you swear you're telling me the truth?
What are you going to name your doll?
Don't sing yet.
Tom decided not to give up.
I vowed I'd never do that.
He made a bet with her.
Do you have a minute?
Are you already married?
I want to name the baby after you.
Tom said he wants to show Mary something.
Do you travel a lot?
We're waiting to hear from Tom.
What was Tom's answer?
Am I approved?
Tom is going to explain it to all of us.
Does this dress make me look fat?
I glanced at my watch.
Something seems to be wrong with my clock.
She tried to dissuade him from participating in the project.
I am going to play tennis tomorrow.
He warned me of the danger.
Tom has already talked to me.
A taxi from the airport costs about thirty dollars.
You will have to go without her.
Let's go by train instead of by bus.
Tom misses his wife Mary and their children.
Tom and Mary were horrible parents.
Tom just wanted to talk to Mary.
I'll buy a pair of scissors.
Tom couldn't hide his disappointment.
Can I borrow your car tonight?
Do you know him?
Can Tom do that?
We're waiting for your answer.
Tom told me to knock on the door.
"I've missed you so much, Tom."
Tom behaved inappropriately.
The measurements must be precise.
They looked very happy.
I didn't think about what I was doing.
The question is who'll go first.
Are you trying to get rid of me?
They don't respect you.
What is he doing?
Did Tom tell you where he bought his trumpet?
I always wondered what that noise was.
I'll die without you.
I thought you'd want to help me.
Brush your teeth after meals.
The moon was above the horizon.
They slept in the same bed.
We need people like that.
We got up early so that we could see the sunrise.
That's what I want most in the world.
Please promise me that you won't do that.
I forgot something in my car.
The dog is sleeping.
I have a rare disease.
I would like to go and have a drink.
"You're going to need help, aren't you?"
I don't even know what to say.
Why was Tom fired?
We'll be at home all day today.
I wasn't working.
Tom asked Mary to dance with him.
Thank you for coming back.
I'm aware of the risks.
Are you sure you're not cold?
Our company isn't very big.
I don't have the money to do that.
I don't watch TV at all.
She glanced shyly at him.
Can you help me when I move?
I don't know either of the two sisters.
I've been waiting for you a long time.
Tom kicked Mary out of the house.
You shouldn't stay here.
Rice grows in warm countries.
This is said to be a sacred place.
Did you really do that for free?
Today isn't my birthday.
What was the use?
Tom is a few inches taller than Mary.
I don't think Tom will be here on time.
Am I older than you?
Please turn down the volume.
You've lost your marbles.
Do you know anyone who speaks French?
Maybe Tom could help.
I can prove who the murderer is.
"Oh my God, you're drunk."
I'm not particularly impressed.
Does Tom scare you?
Tom found a part-time job near his home.
No one else was there.
Tom knows why you agreed to do that.
I still have a lot of questions I want to ask you about your relationship with Tom.
The stock market is severely depressed.
I'd like to go.
I just don't think I can do that.
Where did you get your hair cut?
Something is wrong here.
You need to talk to somebody.
Did you know Tom was Mary's boss?
"Don't ask questions, just come with me."
I'm not ashamed of that.
I've never heard of that.
Tom is famous.
Whose bicycle is this?
I cannot stop it.
I've got nothing to report.
This car is his.
He fell asleep under the tree.
Tom never saw her again.
I didn't say a word.
That's why I came late.
You should call your parents more often.
We'll still be in Boston on Monday.
A cat was on the table.
"You aren't really going to buy Tom's old tractor, are you?"
I cut classes and went to the mall.
I thought you wanted the truth.
I can't figure out why.
He loves toys.
Tom speaks French better than me.
Tom was dressed as a vampire.
Nobody will ever replace you.
Forgive me for breaking my promise.
Tom and I are the same height.
I thought you'd enjoy that.
I have heard nothing from him for five years.
I'm not a student.
I'm biased.
I don't like working on weekends.
Tom works as an intern.
I haven't kissed Tom yet.
I met her at the church.
Tom pretended to be dead.
We shouldn't give up.
We're redoubling our efforts.
I am deeply grateful to you for your kindness.
All of my great-grandparents died before I was born.
You have reached your destination.
My father goes abroad sometimes.
I can't remember the secret code.
Human remains were found during the excavation.
You look fine.
I am married and I have a daughter.
Didn't you know Tom didn't like to do that?
They won't know.
I don't want to know what you think about this.
Tom went to Boston via Chicago.
This church was built in the 12th century.
They saw a cat climbing up the tree.
Is that your room?
Were you ready?
Please make coffee.
He can't have told a lie.
May I go?
I burned the paper.
I'm looking forward to the summer vacation.
Countless stars were twinkling in the sky.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to come over and watch a movie.
Is it really all over?
We're out of coffee.
I've contacted Tom.
It's our one hope.
Help me find Tom.
We'll miss Tom a lot.
They were busy.
I knew you'd have enough time.
I'll leave now.
Have you and Tom ever worked together?
I think that I came too early.
Tom needs to be handcuffed.
I hope you're not disappointed.
"Tom is going there alone, isn't he?"
Children sometimes lack patience.
You did something that I would never do.
Tom is thankful that Mary came to help.
I'm sure it'll happen.
"Why didn't you tell me? ""You never asked."""
Tom answered with a smile.
I don't blame you.
I didn't come here to talk about my problems.
It is necessary that he prepare for the worst.
She left with her friends.
I don't appreciate being lied to.
He's depressed.
There's a cat there.
You can't be here right now.
Tom made everyone laugh.
This is my bike.
You said that an hour ago.
I wanted that.
What did you learn?
I can understand your anger.
Get them out of my sight.
Bring it back to me.
I think you know what Tom's girlfriend's name is.
I was sober.
Tom has just opened a restaurant on Park Street.
Have you told anybody?
Did you want to speak with me?
"At last, they met face to face."
Tom was late as usual.
You didn't say that before.
My car's over there.
I don't need them anymore.
Tom knew it was wrong.
How many times a day do you look at yourself in the mirror?
Tom wanted to feel loved and accepted by others.
It's still light out.
You need not go there.
It's not your problem.
Return to the ship immediately.
This book is for students whose native language is not Japanese.
"Pardon, do you have the time?"
He prays several times a day.
You shouldn't smoke so much.
The doctors did what they could.
I think Tom is expecting somebody.
This chair needs to be fixed.
Are you suggesting another theory?
What's your favorite hot weather food?
How can you be so blind?
I'm a cartoonist.
How about going for a walk?
Tom fell asleep on the floor.
That is mine. I don't know where his is.
"Tom couldn't do it, but Mary could."
Japan plays a key role in the world economy.
Tom knew that he needed to buy a gift for Mary.
I haven't checked my messages yet this morning.
I told Tom he wouldn't like it here.
Get out of bed!
You look like you're in pain.
He easily gets angry.
I had to give Tom a little help.
I want to thank you for what you've done.
I felt sorry for the poor dog.
We can do that later.
We opposed the plan to build a new road.
Please explain to me how you did that.
Let Tom drive.
I admire your restraint.
Are you an imposter?
I don't like this hat. I prefer the gray one.
Tom said he isn't likely to win.
I wouldn't let you win.
I still don't understand what you want from me.
We could hear the groans of the injured man.
It's almost midnight here.
Customers have to be satisfied.
I think Tom told you the truth.
Can you tell me the way to the bank?
Do you drink wine?
Try to do one thing at a time.
Could I look at that one?
I need you to come with me.
Did you eat all the bread?
We hoped that she would win.
That's what I want to know.
I think Tom is here already.
Tom speaks French as well as you do.
I sometimes write to Tom.
He went to London to study English.
You can't kill me.
I don't need your help anymore.
I'm sick and tired of your complaints.
Tom promised me that he wouldn't tell anyone.
We need to get rid of all this stuff.
Are we there yet?
There's only one window in my room.
You need to give Tom some money.
Tom has already gone out.
I think it's dangerous for children to swim in this lake.
You're getting more and more beautiful.
Which cup is yours?
They cannot be saved.
I'm not ashamed to say that I cried.
We have five days to go before the summer vacation.
Tom is likely to come tomorrow.
Tom has been married a long time.
I think this is a good choice.
I wonder if Tom would mind helping us tomorrow.
Get rid of them.
I love dealing with professionals.
I know Tom lied.
Is there anything new on the menu?
It is smaller than Tokyo.
It's the best movie of the year.
She lives in an apartment alone.
The children were busy preparing their lessons.
Tom and Mary soon became best friends.
What does Tom want to talk to Mary about?
Tom made up his mind to marry Mary.
Pigeons can find their way home with the help of the Earth's magnetic field.
Tom would be perfect for this job.
I love chicken.
So long.
I don't think it's a big deal.
Who's this message for?
Tom told me that he'd been forgiven.
It may be true.
I knew that Tom wouldn't wait.
I have one more.
I'm ready to roll up my sleeves.
The water was lukewarm.
I don't think that Tom knows that I love you.
I work at the airport.
How come you didn't do it?
I've already heard this story.
We started singing.
Tom doesn't know how to speak French.
Can we meet tomorrow?
Stay in the car.
I want to be as happy as Tom.
"Don't send me home, please."
Tell me what time I need to be there.
It's going to rain.
Why do you need that?
Were you with Tom the whole time?
School is over.
"I'm happy, Tom."
We could not resist the force of his logic.
I didn't know you were rich.
Could we discuss this tomorrow?
You must make your own decisions.
Tell me what you know about Tom.
How can I make a girl fall in love with me?
Come pick me up.
What did Tom tell you?
Let's ignore that.
I thought he was sick.
The show was very interesting. You should have seen it.
You owe it to yourself.
I don't want to know any more.
Why are you telling me this?
When did the concert start?
You will like Germany.
Our store is open seven days a week.
My doctor told me to give up smoking.
Tom caused all these problems.
The police are looking for you.
I advise you to wait.
I've already answered that question.
You should give Tom another chance.
Please let me out.
Why did you show it to me?
Why are you calling me?
He cleared the roof of snow.
How do you like your new car?
"No matter how you do it, the results will be the same."
Tom told me he doesn't want to work with you.
What's your favorite castle in Japan?
I suspect that Tom won't tell Mary why he did that.
Tom is going to Boston with us.
I could kill you.
I know I'm likely be arrested.
Nobody was ready for what happened.
Did he go there?
I want to be loved.
They succeeded.
I don't have it with me.
If only I had taken your advice.
I'll explain the incident.
I'm sorry for yelling at you yesterday.
Society is composed of individuals.
I don't disagree with your decision.
Tom can't paint.
I just wasn't expecting it.
I have two cameras.
Ask Tom if Mary will come with us or not.
I don't think that Tom understood what was going on.
Tom's bleeding.
All the answers to this question were wrong.
Tom did something I'd never do.
Tom gave Mary everything she wanted.
The businessman appeared on television this morning.
Tom said he hoped to be back by October 20th.
Try to stay positive.
Please don't say anything to Tom about this.
Tom is on vacation.
It's time for breakfast.
That was really scary.
Do you think it'll snow?
We hugged each other.
"Come here, Tom."
It's very unlikely Tom will want to come.
Did you find another picture?
It works now.
I know I need help.
The weather stayed bad.
One of them spoke to me.
How many days did you spend in Australia?
One of the children left the door open.
Do you think I've put on weight?
I got remarried.
We won't let you in.
Do you think plants feel pain?
Tom was arrested for assault.
We seldom see Tom do that.
I've decided to do that.
Did you also invite your friends?
They don't want you. They want Tom.
Cut the red wire.
I don't want to get my clothes dirty.
That's not what you said before.
Tom didn't want to tell me everything.
We're running out of money.
I started swearing.
Maybe next time.
I don't know how Tom did that.
You know very well what I mean.
When are you off?
See you at home.
Is he really coming?
No one knows if he loves her or not.
The police believe Tom was murdered.
You're embarrassing her.
"Tom made several tries, but failed each time."
It couldn't be Tom.
That would be awkward.
I won't be a second.
I remember that you said that you had a car.
Neither Tom nor Mary talked to me about that.
He works on some really crazy projects.
I'm a little angry with you.
Tom was too fat.
How could Tom know that was going to happen?
Tom was busy at that time.
I'm not accustomed to getting up early.
Let's hope Tom was right.
Tom is a traitor.
Please come back home as soon as you can.
It still works sometimes.
I was convicted.
I need the ladder.
Tom faked his death.
"As he gets older, he's getting more and more stubborn."
Tom's apartment is spacious.
He was there on business.
Can I call my friend in Australia?
Hasn't the parcel arrived yet?
I'd like two kilos of apples.
Tom is still just a child.
Show me your stamp collection.
Tom is trying to lose weight.
It won't work.
It is difficult for me to solve that problem.
Please handle it with the utmost care.
"In my opinion, you're beautiful."
Just give me the phone.
Theoretically it should work.
You have nothing to be ashamed of.
Tom hasn't told me what to do.
Tom is only a couple of years younger than Mary.
I think they saw me.
Do you have any friends who are doctors?
I always thought so.
Tom bet Mary dinner that it doesn't rain this week.
I must get back to my work.
Tom and I went to the same high school.
I have a friend who's a doctor.
I never really liked Tom much.
What happened was my fault.
Tom won't believe this.
My time is very expensive.
The letter returned.
I've not been feeling very well lately.
Tom loved this movie.
What makes us human?
The roads were empty.
I didn't think you'd let me do that.
Take me home.
I really appreciate you helping me.
Could you lower the volume a little?
There are some oranges on the tree.
We are looking forward to seeing you.
"It is not very polite, either."
Sitting all day isn't good for you.
He is a pioneer in this field.
Car production in that year reached a record 10 million vehicles.
Tom has been warned many times.
He is late for meetings nine times out of ten.
How in the world do you expect me to pay this?
It's not you I'm worried about.
I have a big surprise for you.
I believe you should go.
French has many more vowels than Japanese.
I promised not to tell anybody.
Give me a few minutes.
Did you talk to your new classmates yesterday?
Please give that back to me.
I thought we were happy.
Ants and giraffes are distant cousins.
Please take me away from here!
No one wants to talk to Tom anymore.
Tom usually eats a bowl of cereal for breakfast.
I didn't know you could do that.
Tom was injured in a traffic accident.
His lecture disappointed us.
He has long legs.
Why don't you take the day off?
Tom is a Red Cross volunteer.
Please adopt this cat.
Is that love?
I'm sure that Tom didn't do that.
She told him to study.
What do you want me to see?
Do you have any ideas about it?
Tom will be back next year.
Is Tom always like this?
I was misinformed.
I couldn't recognize her at first.
That's not your fault.
I didn't want to tell you this.
"To tell the truth, she is my sister."
Tom must be Mary's brother.
There was a yellow school bus parked in front of the fire hydrant.
He traveled all over Europe.
"I know her, but I'm not acquainted with the rest of the family."
There's a white dove on the roof.
I'm still thinking about Tom.
I made the same mistake again.
It was the best tea I had ever had.
Tom isn't illiterate.
I can't stop laughing.
Her cheeks turned red.
They compared the new car with the old one.
Your friend Tom told me to give this to you.
Have you ever studied French?
Tom has to go home now.
"If something is wrong, tell me."
I don't know her.
Which is mine?
That will be better for you.
I've still got a lot to learn.
"My husband is a teacher, too."
Thousands of people died of hunger.
Don't tell me. Tell Tom.
Please put this in the microwave oven.
I love Mary.
You must apologize for what you said.
He doesn't work here anymore.
Tell Tom I have a broken leg.
I'm single and I've never been married.
Can you tell them I'm not in?
The girl went into the forest to look for mushrooms.
Tom died from leukemia in 2013.
Tom knows who can do that and who can't.
I have nothing more to say about him.
Do you want to drive?
I had no one to talk to.
I bought a sweater.
Is my laundry ready?
This is the medicine I was telling you about.
You're a lot like me.
Is Tom a good kisser?
I didn't go to Tom's funeral.
Be specific.
Tom told his dentist that he brushes his teeth after every meal.
She went on with the work.
Tom likes fruit.
Tom will be present.
I've studied French for three years.
Someone tried to kill me.
You worked a lot this week.
I have to make certain Tom knows what to do.
He only paid ten dollars for that shirt.
I know how hard this is.
Draw a circle.
Tell Tom we're here.
Are all of those children yours?
I have to help my mother.
Did you do what I asked?
I don't think that anybody suspected that you weren't really Tom.
I would like you to stay with me.
Tom walked into the house carrying a box.
We'll reach Boston before dark.
It started raining heavily.
Tom wasn't the youngest.
I can't carry this suitcase by myself.
You're the one who suggested buying this computer.
My camera is broken.
Why are you always doing that?
I still don't understand how it works.
I wonder if Tom is here.
I think Tom will always love Mary.
Do I need to transfer?
I have crooked teeth.
Tom told me it was an emergency.
Can I come?
Who attacked you?
Someone's trying to kill us.
You've got to get rid of it.
I have to do that tomorrow.
What do you want to be?
Is he here yet?
Do it yourself.
"Next, I'd like to sing a song I wrote."
Women are judged differently than men.
You're very astute.
I don't know anything about your job.
She and I are the same age.
How did you make it?
Tom is afraid Mary will say no.
I'd never go to Boston with Tom.
You should call Tom.
I don't have children.
It's good to have you back.
The failure of the crops was the major cause of starvation in that region.
My son is tired of hamburgers.
I was angry and confused.
I don't think I would do that here.
I can afford neither the time nor the money for a trip.
Please don't bother me.
Tom married the most beautiful girl in the city.
Tom has nothing.
Don't you believe me?
What should I do to stop hiccups?
Why are you under the desk?
Do you know them?
What do you want to see in Boston?
Don't watch television.
He didn't want to get in trouble.
I often receive letters from him.
He hid himself behind the door.
I was with Tom all day.
They're doctors.
We're not welcome.
They were almost run over by a truck.
What you say is true.
Tom has broken something again.
It's not a hospital.
You're so stuck up.
Germany shares a border with the Netherlands.
I forgot to call Tom.
Watch Tom.
That's probably what Tom meant.
Tom and Mary were neighbors.
How many children do you have?
Tom is lazy.
Wash your hands right now.
Tom was killed in a dark alley.
Fate smiled upon me.
Tom doesn't need to wait any longer.
What do you know about this?
Tom wants Mary to help him with his homework.
He is allegedly the murderer.
He's a cold-hearted jerk.
Tom made a few mistakes.
Are you going to the movies this weekend?
The burglar gained access to the house through this door.
I wish you were here.
Would you mind if we asked you a few questions?
How long was Tom in Boston?
Everyone was silent.
I put my hand on his shoulder.
I think it's strange that he didn't speak to you.
Is it true that Tom was in Boston last week?
You never know.
The twins are so much alike that I can not distinguish one from the other.
I don't know when he'll be here.
Don't you want to see this?
He finally became the president of IBM.
He reads a lot of books.
This is a difficult mission.
I hope that you'll help me.
Tom made me look stupid.
Did you feed the dog?
Don't you have a bicycle?
Did you order the book?
I don't think you'll be allowed to do that.
I'm going to stay home tonight.
I knew it was just a misunderstanding.
Tom blamed himself for what happened.
Do you see the entrance of the park?
Put the bag down.
My house is beyond that bridge.
Tell Tom everything.
Tom wanted to see it.
I had no idea why.
I read Tom a story.
He asked me to do it.
How did you know I grew up in Boston?
We can't afford to lose you.
Tom was ambitious.
I want you to go back.
I suggest you buy it.
Tom said that his dog's name was Cookie.
I'm looking forward to meeting you.
It isn't here.
Nobody's taking a bath right now.
Thanks for your help.
Tom walked right past Mary.
I was trying not to laugh.
That's another matter.
I was hoping we could eat early tonight.
Who should I ask?
Do you know how much Tom makes?
I'm glad you're here with me.
What are these doing here?
"Goodbye, Tom."
Tom hasn't seen Mary in weeks.
I know I can do that tomorrow.
I've met the perfect woman.
Tom played a pivotal role in the company's success.
This is the same type of car as my father has.
Wait a while.
We can deliver the product in June.
Don't tell Tom that I did that.
About how many zoos do you think there are in Australia?
Let's not play.
Tom isn't that young anymore.
The children haven't studied division yet.
Thank you very much for all you have done.
I bought fresh bread.
I've been seeking an answer to your question.
I wrote it down on a napkin.
Can I catch a taxi near here?
I cry every time I hear this song.
Did you buy a car?
Our team lost all its games.
Tom wasn't as busy as you were.
How many cups of tea did you drink?
Tom leaned down and kissed his daughter on the forehead.
He got up at eight in the morning.
Can you tell me what this symbol means?
I've been doing this for three hours.
I didn't know Tom would do that again.
It doesn't seem like what we should be doing right now.
What kind of house do you live in?
Did she write in her diary yesterday?
I stepped in the mud.
I had no idea you knew Tom.
He relented.
I'd like you to have it.
Don't you know that he passed away two years ago?
"When I was your age, Pluto was a planet."
I hate feeling sorry for myself.
I thought that you'd be interested.
I know Tom is a lazy kid.
I think that Tom likes Mary.
Tom came for the sole purpose of getting information.
I will do the best I can.
Have you ever seen anything like this?
"When you're good enough to join the team, we'll let you join."
I've always wanted a child.
I'll need your help.
We didn't see him anywhere.
The house is vacant.
Where were you at the time of the fire?
You shouldn't have gone fishing today.
Aren't you married?
I have to solve this problem.
I know you have a lot of questions.
Tom told me about what happened to Mary.
Stop borrowing my clothes without asking.
He has to come.
We went to the mountain to ski.
Tom was already here.
Promise me that you won't do that again.
Accidents arise from carelessness.
They're your competition.
Do you sometimes go to the movies?
You're the only one who can defeat Tom.
I met them.
We clapped our hands.
Tom didn't have to rub it in.
I was concerned for obvious reasons.
Did Tom really dance?
I said that I didn't go shopping with her.
I'm the chief engineer.
It's by no means impossible to earn one million yen a month.
I think I'll take that one.
Trains come more often than buses.
They're out of breath.
Are you home alone?
"As far as I remember, he didn't say that."
I could order you to stay.
That looks like blood.
I took off my coat because it was hot.
Do you remember how to do this?
Tom just wanted to help.
Could you wait outside?
How many days did you spend doing that?
Tom has done an excellent job.
I knew Tom would go there.
Tom moistened his lips.
She was arrested by the police.
She's thinking of taking a couple of courses at a cooking school.
Look back and you'll see a black cat.
Please see to it that the child does not go near the pond.
Don't tell my girlfriend.
Open the doors.
I'm tired from lack of sleep.
He wrote a book about birds.
Your brother is very angry.
Tom is having a good time.
I was afraid that I might hurt his feelings.
He said that he was very happy.
He's a DJ.
He is listening to the radio.
You can't do everything.
Why are you offended?
I knew you wouldn't give up.
Am I going too fast?
Tom never went back to Boston.
They took a big risk.
I left.
Tom had a big argument with Mary.
Tom went there to meet Mary.
Tom didn't specify how many pencils to buy.
I saw my sister there.
Have you been able to contact Tom?
Don't I get a hug?
You need to go with Tom now.
Can you play tennis?
We don't have any more bread.
That dress is awful.
They are muddy.
Tom sent Mary a gift.
Let's go tell Tom.
Tom walked his dogs every morning.
Tom didn't think he was committing a crime.
Take him away.
We all knew it would happen sooner or later.
I think Tom was exaggerating.
I didn't know that Tom was hungry.
That could come in handy.
I told him to come the following day.
Tom had a bad dream last night.
I wonder who gave Tom that.
Tom seems tired tonight.
Whose notebook is that?
I gave him my address.
Tom had nothing to do with Mary getting fired.
It's high time you got going.
Old age creeps upon us unnoticed.
The birthrate is rapidly declining in this country.
You helped us win.
I thought you moved to Boston.
Tom wasn't the one who did that.
I talked to Tom on Monday.
You almost killed me.
I did you a favor.
Tom needs a cab.
I'll get in touch with you as soon as I arrive.
That's how we met.
There isn't any soap.
Is there room for one more?
I want you to consider this proposal.
Tom complained about the cold.
I am from the USA.
Guess what his name is.
Are you making a sandwich for Tom?
You must follow the rules.
How many women over thirty do you know?
Why did Tom name his dog Cookie?
"Like you just said, we don't have the slightest chance."
What should I have done?
There is milk in the fridge.
I was very impressed by his good behavior.
The weather's nice today.
Tom isn't bothering me.
Tom told her.
"You can fix it, can't you?"
See what's going on.
We didn't see any girls in the group.
Tom is a sorcerer.
Most likely Tom won't win.
Several students in the back of the classroom were sleeping.
I wonder what Tom and Mary talked about.
I'm sure you'll like Tom.
Tom invited Mary to his house.
Tom wasn't punished.
I didn't know whether I'd be allowed to do that or not.
Did you hear about Tom?
I think that's where Tom works.
You cheated.
They're doing their job.
Tom quit his job.
She showed me the present that she had received from her boyfriend.
I have to do the same thing.
Tom was a nice kid.
The committee killed the bill.
I left the room.
I asked for grape juice.
Was anyone hurt?
Maybe that'll be enough.
What should we do?
He's addicted to heroin.
We talked about boys.
Why were you late?
The policeman separated the two men who were fighting.
I think Tom and Mary were here.
The poor child was on the verge of starvation.
My wife told me to throw this old hat away.
I knew we couldn't trust Tom.
I think we should take a taxi.
"Tom is going to be OK, isn't he?"
Are you leaving?
Do you think Tom understands?
I have a friend whose father is a lawyer.
I'm glad you're home.
It is said that the price of wine may go up at any time now.
I wished it would last forever.
I threw it away.
I knew Tom could win.
Tom isn't what he was.
Let's drink beer.
They don't know what went wrong.
You'll regret this.
I have a wonderful teacher.
He's one of the best.
Say nothing.
I have a friend who knows Tom.
Tom wants to be a veterinarian.
Tom said that Mary was depressed.
Tom grabbed Mary by the hand.
Tom told Mary he was interested in art.
Did Tom tell you why he did that?
Do any of you want a cup of coffee?
I revised my theory.
Tom said that he didn't want to drive.
Where do you usually buy eggs?
Tom knows how to comfort people.
Tom is too young to get a driver's license.
I've been waiting for an hour and a half.
We've got to find Tom before he does something stupid.
Things change.
I reflected on the problem.
I've missed you very much.
I haven't told anyone about us.
Tom had a black eye.
Somebody stepped on his foot.
"If it rains tomorrow, I'm not going to the meeting."
"I want to come, too."
I wish you'd told me before.
When are we going to be paid?
Tom said he was coming back.
Tom promised Mary he would do what she asked.
They lost it.
I know I should've called first.
Tom wanted to apologize to you.
You don't seem to like Tom.
Don't leave the engine running.
We're planning to spend our honeymoon abroad.
I hope Tom likes the present I bought for him.
I'm not coming.
I have a severe headache.
What would you say to that?
I think Tom hates us.
I don't care if you go or not. I'm going anyway.
Go and buy three bottles of coke.
He came running.
Tom and Mary are married.
The fat woman was holding a monkey.
Tom said that he didn't like my dress.
Tom will be on duty tomorrow.
I wonder why Tom left Mary.
Tom told Mary he wanted to win.
"Tom hit Mary, not me."
Tom isn't going to let you do that.
I think I'd like to be alone right now.
This book isn't as interesting as that book.
Tom will never come back.
Tom and Mary leave tomorrow.
He probably won't come.
We're just hanging out.
I'm not in Boston anymore.
I really liked doing that.
I taught Tom how to cook.
Tom has just returned from Boston.
They're both smiling.
I'm glad that Tom made it home in one piece.
You're my guest.
I don't think that it's right.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I hurt my foot.
Tom needs some space.
I always says no.
This is the money Tom stole.
These ties are very expensive.
She's wearing a black hat.
The police are here.
Tom brushed his teeth and washed his face.
I need my coat.
Tom won't forget that.
I go where I'm told to go.
I just bought a boat.
I thought the game was over.
That isn't Tom's only problem.
Didn't you use to have a car?
The girl walked slowly.
All of them will get a prize.
You've stayed away a long time.
We didn't tell you that.
Tom kissed Mary on the tip of her nose.
I don't believe any of you.
You said you didn't want that.
Tom told me he doesn't know Mary.
I've decided to go to Boston with Tom.
Tom doesn't want me to go.
I thought that was well known.
Progress is unavoidable.
Tom thinks you can do that.
Today is October twentieth.
"He is a nice person, to be sure, but not very clever."
Tom has already won.
The lamb was killed by the wolf.
Did Tom say where he was?
The teacher compared my poem with one of his.
I often wear a hat in the winter.
Stay here and wait for Tom.
She seems to be very ill.
I hope that you aren't serious.
Thank you for completing this form.
They don't take prisoners.
I invited him to the party and he accepted.
"If he's busy, help him."
He's young and attractive.
Tom has been wasting a lot of time.
You put too much sugar in your tea.
I'm over you.
Where is Room 105?
Tom is by nature an optimist.
"If you do that, I will too."
Tom is my biological father.
It isn't going to happen.
Tom gives me a lot of advice.
They don't talk about it.
Tom does whatever we tell him to do.
Tom looks pleased.
Tom was all alone in the house.
Tom is not my friend anymore.
I want to serve my country.
You should let Tom leave.
They are all innocent children.
"Is Tom in Boston? ""Yes, he is."""
You didn't listen.
What did you tell Tom about me?
Tom had nowhere to go.
Tom buttered a slice of bread.
Bus fares vary according to the length of the trip.
You must not jump to conclusions.
Tom is acting like a child.
He changed his name.
I think we'll go with you.
We'll have to celebrate the winter solstice.
Just apologize.
I miss her so much.
Tom and John pretended to be brothers.
We're going to stay in Boston.
Take me to them.
Tom will do that next week.
It was about time.
We know what Tom wants.
I looked at my watch again.
Don't you want to know where I'm going?
Thanks a lot for your help.
I was here when you came in.
I don't speak French at all.
His name was Tom.
Tom gave a different answer.
Tom is the only person Mary really trusts.
Tom will be here in just a moment.
That's the question we have to solve.
Is there anything you want to tell me?
I don't think that you can eat that.
Who found them?
I could never hate you.
I didn't know where the fire extinguisher was.
Don't you think it's a little too big?
Can you teach me French?
Who doesn't like free stuff?
Tom speaks French with his grandparents and English with his parents.
I would like to get to know you better.
Let's hit the road.
We did that ourselves.
I've already told you everything that I know about that.
Do you know what's happened to Tom?
There's something strange about Tom.
Tom said he was finished doing that.
Tom has an old felt hat he always wears in the rain.
I knew Tom had lied to us.
Promise me you won't tell anyone.
You've got a bright future.
It was very dark inside the mine.
None of us want that to happen.
I wrote back to Tom.
I'm taking everything with me.
Tom was excused from work yesterday because he was sick.
Tom had reasons to be angry.
French is my favorite subject in school.
The first edition was published ten years ago.
Are you telling me you can't swim?
"Sorry, I was a jerk."
Hurry up! We are all waiting for you.
We have no idea what Tom did.
I'm more than a friend.
You don't have to decide right now.
They are crazy about jazz.
How many cameras does Tom have?
I don't use Facebook.
I didn't tell Tom you're here.
My nails are too short.
Are you going to the theater tonight?
I've got wine.
Your English has gotten better.
I like carrots.
Do you really have a boyfriend?
"Tom is from Boston, but now he lives in Chicago."
Can you explain what PKO stands for?
The dress comes to my knees.
Settlers were forced off their land.
It happened more than three days ago.
Can you help me with my school project?
When will you give me back the money you borrowed from me a year ago?
Tom knows where we are.
Give me one more.
This desk is a little too low for me.
"If you want to be a good father, you need to spend time with your children."
He doesn't understand you.
This is a real breakthrough.
You know I don't like it when you're late.
Get to the point!
Do you think Tom is still afraid?
I haven't eaten or drunk anything since yesterday morning.
Tom and Mary both know that that's unlikely to happen.
Do you want to be rich?
I did my homework.
Would you like it washed?
Is it about ten o'clock?
What do you want me to tell you?
I tried to help my grandfather.
I know that you still love me.
Mary is quite beautiful.
They won't tell me anything.
Tom sometimes walks to school.
Thanks for telling me what needed to be done.
I'll give you a piece of good advice.
I want to learn how to speak French.
Every nunnery has its own rules.
I know all about it.
Tom broke a window yesterday.
I thought you looked tired.
Items with a red price tag are on sale.
They needed help.
Do you think Tom is still angry?
I want to see you dance.
Tom cheated on today's exam.
Why did we fail?
She has a son and two daughters.
Do you do a lot with your kids?
Tom always does that for Mary.
He speaks in his sleep.
The ship leaves for Honolulu tomorrow.
Tom has had eight jobs in ten years.
Everyone knows this.
My son can neither read nor write yet.
I hope you brought an umbrella.
Is that even legal?
I'd like to speak to Tom again.
That topic is worth discussing.
Tom gave Mary her bag.
We were just playing.
I think it's dangerous to swim here.
You'll just laugh.
When did Tom wake up?
Can you do that before you go home?
We have many employees who can speak French well.
I didn't break it.
Tom very seldom smiles anymore.
I didn't tell him you were coming.
Tom told me he'd wait for us.
The children caught butterflies.
I don't know what to expect.
I really don't want to live here.
Please speak more loudly.
That's actually very difficult to do.
I thought I heard a gunshot.
I'm not in love with him. We're just good friends.
He is commander of our troops.
I don't think I can help you.
Don't insult me.
How long will it take to get well?
I don't have an ear for music.
I don't smoke anymore.
Do you think I'm scared of you?
I can help you with this.
You need to fix it.
I'm very glad I wasn't there.
He couldn't go out because of the snow.
I suspect Tom was lying.
I got some sand in my eye.
I don't have as much money as I used to have.
Tom and I were on the same bus.
Why doesn't Tom visit us anymore?
Where does he want to go?
Tom knows that he can trust Mary.
What classes do you have tomorrow?
I'm still not sure who they are.
Why didn't you answer?
Tom doesn't want to move.
Tom isn't going to meet Mary at the airport.
I suspect that Tom wasn't really surprised.
Dead dogs don't bite.
Am I alone here?
Mary always has well-manicured fingernails.
I think Tom is too young to be dating.
"Can we come, too?"
Tom didn't let Mary pay the bill.
I'm not allowed to talk.
I watched Tom swim.
I think I know what this is.
I'm studying English at home.
Why did you sign the confession?
We're still married.
Slavery has been abolished in most parts of the world.
I have a question I want to ask you.
Tom took a chance.
"Alcohol does not solve any problems, but neither does milk."
Tom didn't know what it was.
I remained behind.
"See, I told you Tom would be here."
Tom doesn't know much.
Tom may have already left for Australia.
Tom doesn't win very often.
All I want to do is go to bed.
You will soon get used to eating Japanese food.
Please mark the correct answer.
Why don't I have a girlfriend?
I found it.
You can't expect good weather here at this time of year.
He greets everyone loudly.
I've caused you enough trouble already.
You have to be prepared for anything.
Are you certain that's what you want?
I ran out of the house.
I'm lucky that no one saw me do that.
They offered the guests some coffee.
Tom isn't going to leave us.
Are all the windows closed?
I want you to know I believe you.
My office is on the fourth floor of that gray six-story building.
I think that's inevitable.
I'm out of ideas.
I don't have to go to school tomorrow.
Was anyone injured?
I have to do it myself.
I didn't know you were busy.
Put all the rubbish in the barrel.
They continued walking.
Tom counted the money.
I didn't know that Tom liked doing that.
Tom walked across the street.
Why would Tom lie about his age?
I could easily fix that.
Who was the book written by?
I can't find my purse.
Everything's going to get better.
My plan worked.
Are you surprised to see me?
I'm sure Tom doesn't think that.
I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't have done that.
I've missed Australia.
I used to live in Boston.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted something to drink.
It was extremely cold in Boston.
There's a cat there.
I don't think that Tom should've done that.
How often do you use your oven?
Tom doesn't understand how a computer works.
Who's that girl who winked at you?
I think I'm going to be late.
Tom hasn't yet done that.
There are almost seven billion people in the world.
I had to stay in Boston.
It's easier than you think.
I did something bad.
"Now and then I think of divorcing him. ""You must be kidding!"""
Are you still free tomorrow evening?
I was caught in a shower on my way to the station.
It wasn't on purpose.
Tom thinks he's better than other people.
Let's do that together after lunch.
Tom is a big coward.
Tom told me he was puzzled.
Please see who is at the door.
Tom doesn't always do what he's told.
Did you have a favorite book as a child?
Tom is graying fast.
I can't stand all this noise.
Tom pulled out his iPhone.
Do you live here?
You're completely useless.
I just got a call from your school.
What are you talking about?
Yesterday was Friday and the day after tomorrow is Monday.
Tom stepped on my foot.
You don't need to make a decision right now.
Don't ask me what Tom is thinking.
Look at this one.
I advised Tom not to eat the mushrooms he found in the woods.
You're cruel.
Tom asked Mary to walk a little slower.
Tom asked me to wake him up at 6:30.
I was watching TV at this time yesterday.
They speak Spanish in Colombia.
Do we have to do this every day?
Does Tom know what you're doing?
Tom was half right.
She turned down the radio.
Tanning can cause skin cancer.
I saw you outside.
You must get off at the next station.
It's so typical.
Lambs are baby sheep.
Didn't you know Tom was allergic to walnuts?
Why is it dangerous?
I want to be ready for anything.
The purpose of our trip is to visit friends and see some tourist spots.
Are you forgetful?
I'm sure your intentions were good.
I'm trying to avoid Tom.
I have fifteen hundred cows.
I raise cattle.
Do you think that'll work?
I was distracted.
Stop treating me like a kid.
Tom sings better than me.
I want to speak to you about Tom.
Tom told me Mary wasn't tired.
Think before you open your mouth.
Tom says this is absurd.
Tom brought an umbrella.
Tom is better at doing that than Mary is.
I was horrified.
Tom's car is stuck in the snow.
Don't let Tom find out about that.
Get away!
Don't leave your glasses on the table.
I wasn't present at the meeting.
Let's pitch the tent while it's still light.
We'll sing.
What do you plan on doing with the money?
He stole money from her wallet.
You call that a marriage?
Tom hopes Mary will win.
Will I get what I want?
"I could fix that, I think."
You don't know everything I do.
I know that Tom is a very fast swimmer.
Don't let him take the car.
Does that mean something?
I didn't know who they were.
I wouldn't let you win.
Tom has meetings all day on Mondays.
Is there anything I can do to help you?
What were you doing in my house?
I decided to study abroad.
I have no intention of answering that question.
Is it not black?
Your glasses fell on the floor.
May I ask who's speaking?
Tom fell into the water and drowned.
Dogs are permitted.
When can we eat?
Tom is still abroad.
I just woke up.
I was hoping Tom would go home.
"This rule applies to you, too."
"He's got two cats, one white and one black."
A considerable amount of money was appropriated for the national defense.
I want this to be a surprise.
Tom told me he liked my idea.
Tom has no savings.
Tom gave Mary his telephone number.
Didn't you know where Tom wanted to go?
I'd do it if I could.
Tom can't hide the truth from Mary anymore.
I just need some fresh air.
How much is the car you are planning to buy?
I saw a doctor this morning.
Why did you call me so late?
Tom wrote to a friend.
How long would it take you to paint this room?
I wonder whether you understand.
Tom shouldn't go there by himself.
Tom likes the same kind of music Mary does.
I was impressed with what I saw.
Tom said that Mary lied.
I know Tom is smarter than I am.
He narrowly escaped being run over.
I didn't know that Tom saw us.
No one could sleep that night.
Tom should never have to do that.
I'm not accustomed to doing this.
Tom was sitting silent for half an hour.
Just take one.
You're disturbing the whole neighborhood.
Have you seen Tom this morning?
What do you have in your right hand?
Tom opened the door to let the cat in.
Don't talk during class.
Is it OK to drink alcoholic drinks in this park?
Tom was Mary's first real boyfriend.
Languages aren't his forte.
It was wise of you to ask him for help.
I have finished.
I can not buy spare parts for this car.
Click on the link below.
I don't know where your keys are.
Tom will arrive at around 2:30.
Are you sure that's safe?
I report to work at 9 o'clock every morning.
I've been busy all week.
I decided to continue doing that.
Tom reminds me of someone.
You didn't tell me Tom smoked.
Brace yourselves for impact.
Tom often plays the guitar.
How much insurance do you carry on your house?
Do you think it's going to snow?
I got everything I wanted.
My cat is running around the room.
Scroll down to the bottom of the page.
Tom is expecting Mary to come.
He is known as a great poet.
Should we call Tom?
He said there was no life on Mars.
I hope you stay in prison until you die.
I'm extremely rich.
He is a very imaginative writer.
The dog was covered in mud from head to foot.
We can't leave Tom here. He won't survive on his own.
Tom doesn't like his new glasses.
I think it's time for me to ask for his advice.
What do you mean?
I don't like dirty jokes.
Who do you know here?
Some minerals are important for human health.
We laughed and laughed.
Tom seems bright.
There was only one left.
Bite your tongue.
He was blind from birth.
Why did ancient Egyptians love jewels so much?
The clothes Tom wears are made by his mother.
Many people have chosen to stay.
I'm not suggesting you go alone.
Let's get a little closer.
Tom denies he paid ransom money.
Wait for us here.
Why is no one doing that?
Can Tom go first?
"Can you gift-wrap this, please?"
Tom never talks about his job.
I don't hear any voices.
How much does it cost?
I don't believe for one second that Tom did those things.
A small stream runs by my house.
I just want to know what Tom said.
Tom'll understand.
I can't hear what they're saying.
I'm here and I'm ready to help.
Tom seemed to like Mary.
I've misplaced my wallet.
I'm afraid of being laughed at.
You didn't mention having children.
I'm not crying.
Is it large enough?
I thought you'd been killed. I'm glad I was wrong.
Tom is a biochemist.
She's loved by her friends.
Why didn't he come?
Where are the girls?
You've got to win.
I prefer the black one.
Who ordered you to do this?
I don't care what other people think of me.
That's no way to treat a guest.
"I'm sorry, I really am."
I'd like to stay home tonight.
Take this medicine after meals.
Tom promised to return the books I lent him.
I believe this isn't a good idea.
How many hot dogs have you sold today?
"Anyway, you don't have to worry."
It's not for everybody.
Tom knew that I was here.
Do you want some?
I have the same dictionary as your brother has.
Her decision to move to Chicago surprised us.
Why didn't I think of this myself?
They are on good terms with each other.
I hope that your dreams come true.
Tom is at home with his children.
Tell us that joke again.
I like blue.
Could you tell me your name again?
Tom probably didn't mind.
I'm going to stay here and watch TV.
The train is coming.
Tom isn't much taller than I am.
I've already said I don't know the answer.
Tom can already write his own name.
Some people like coffee and others prefer tea.
Tom knows something I don't.
This picture must've been taken in 1964.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
Tom doesn't need to worry anymore.
I want you to try it.
I'm jealous.
Don't get me involved in this.
Something's happening here.
Tom wasn't aware that Mary was married.
He is poor at chemistry.
I want to see Tom happy.
It tasted good.
Tom didn't even bother replying.
The medicine had a wonderful effect on him.
Tom knows we're here.
Where were you last night?
Tom wrote an article for the school newspaper.
We have a few questions for you.
"Ladies and gentlemen, please come this way."
I wonder if it really was a coincidence.
I wanted to get married. You're the one who didn't.
You're so smart.
You need to help Tom.
Tom said he doesn't remember doing it.
You surprised me.
Tom rinsed his mouth.
I was extremely proud.
Mary is helping her mother.
Tom will never leave Boston.
They were tired of waiting.
Tom made fun of Mary.
You're awful.
Could you put this report into Italian for me?
It's better not to go there.
They are my sisters.
Give him a hug.
I think that you didn't watch the video to the end.
"Let's go, Tom."
Tom knows what he's talking about.
I didn't fall asleep until after 2 o'clock in the morning.
I need three pairs of black socks.
It was a good answer.
He is the champion.
Do you have a bigger one?
Walt Whitman is my favorite American poet.
Tom wants a glass of water.
Can you show me the house?
Are you looking for someone?
Do not count your chickens before they are hatched.
Would you rather be healthy or wealthy?
How dare you tell me what I should or shouldn't do!
"You know where Tom lives, don't you?"
I miss Boston so much.
Now you are an adult.
This is the magazine I spoke to you about.
"I'm sorry, this is a private party."
How did Tom meet Mary?
Tom said you're very stubborn.
She wanted to become a teacher.
Tom stopped the car and turned off the engine.
I want your opinion.
We had to abandon our plan.
Don't try too hard.
I thought that Tom was in Australia.
I don't think that anyone was here yesterday.
Why is your French so good?
How do you want your eggs?
I don't think that anybody will like Tom.
Cheese is made from milk.
Did you get a chance to talk to Tom?
He pointed out that the plan would cost a lot of money.
Tom jumped off the cliff.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's phone number.
Tom couldn't go to John and Mary's wedding.
Nobody hates you.
I'm sure Tom is going to be hungry when he gets home.
How's your job going?
She looks unhappy.
We found out where he lives.
Tom wanted Mary to look for John.
I wish I had asked you for advice.
This isn't enough.
Tom got tired of waiting and went on home.
She has a book.
We have two daughters.
We'll remain here for the night.
I attend a public school.
I don't have a ticket.
I'm a carpenter.
You'd better take this.
I saw you cooking.
He knows quite well what it is like to be poor.
Do you think Tom knows what happened?
They kept their love a secret.
I get your drift.
How much will all this cost?
I need a broom.
"I could've done that, but I chose not to."
"If it snows a lot tomorrow, let's make a snowman."
Tom lives from hand to mouth.
Tom wanted to know where Mary lived.
My father drives a very old car.
Tom taught his children how to play chess.
Are you going to kill me?
I told Tom I'd wait.
Let's contact Tom.
Have you ever signed a contract?
No one was detained.
Tom leaned over to tie his shoelaces.
Tom and Mary barely know each other.
I have a bit of time to relax.
Where did you find this awful dog?
Tom could hardly breathe.
Tom says he likes his new job.
Tom asked for a blanket and a pillow.
Tom told everyone that he was Mary's husband.
Tom is on his way.
Tom comes here every other week.
Do you write in French?
"Today, I'm not going to school."
We did the wrong thing.
He was the king of rock-and-roll.
I had to carry Tom upstairs.
Tom asked me to come here.
It's raining now in Boston.
Tom poured Mary a cup of coffee.
I've been to see Tom.
Tom high-fived his friend.
We seem to have lost Tom.
His grandmother looks healthy.
Do you like this car?
Tom can help Mary out.
It is very hot in the kitchen.
Why do you care about this?
That isn't the same.
I was very disorientated.
Do you know where she is?
Tom kneeled.
Who gave you that black eye?
Tom asked us not to be late.
He has large blue eyes.
Tom is too far away to hear us.
I'll miss you very much.
We'll go to Boston by car.
Don't burst my bubble.
Tom is from a wealthy family.
I'm not afraid of the future.
Tom needs an assistant.
Does Tom still want to go with us?
That's easy for you to say.
He told us that we should leave right away.
Thank you for everything you did for us.
Tom is involved.
I have many discs.
Why did you do that without me?
Take a book and read it.
Do you really think Tom is wrong?
Tom stayed in the car while Mary went into the supermarket.
Have you ever read the Constitution of Japan?
Have dinner with me tomorrow.
The police persuaded her not to jump off the bridge.
I always wondered about that.
Tom said that Mary was moody.
Adjust your tie.
They are about the same age.
Do you want to watch TV?
Your advice didn't help me at all.
I'd suggest you be more careful.
Perhaps you should tell Tom.
I'll buy you this book.
Tom is not mad at Mary.
Let's consider the worst that could happen.
He is very sensitive.
Tom owes me money.
Tom opened the safe and took out his passport.
Where do you think he lives?
Hunting is prohibited in this area.
I was deceived.
This tree is older than I am.
I've saved the best for last.
Let's schedule it for some other time.
Where can I get a good meal?
Your wife called.
Tom is about the same age as us.
I'm glad I don't have your job.
I was admiring the view.
We don't need this here.
The investigation is ongoing.
Don't leave the bicycle out in the rain.
Tom hasn't yet told us about that.
I've done everything you've asked me to do.
I didn't know you owned a truck.
I advise you to stop smoking.
What would make you happy?
I've had a lot of time to practice.
I was about to leave when you telephoned.
Put that back.
Can we come with you?
There's a farm close by.
Don't you want to know who that man is?
I didn't ask Tom to do anything.
You were my friend.
I'm afraid my depth perception is very poor.
It's been over a week since I last saw Tom.
He disappeared.
I have lots of rubber bands.
"You're no doubt confused, Tom."
Tom is very angry with Mary.
"You aren't going to the party dressed like that, are you?"
I want a parrot.
We had a very pleasant stay at their house.
I'm not strong enough.
I don't like the way Tom does that.
I collected stamps when I was a kid.
"Suddenly, a good idea occurred to me."
Do you trust me?
Things can't get any worse.
I hope Tom understands.
"If that doesn't work, try something else."
Tom said that he wasn't angry.
You aren't allowed to go into that room.
Tom found Mary a good job.
Nobody messes with him.
I can't get my tractor started.
Tom couldn't come because he was sick.
I thought that Tom was your friend.
I don't want to go back to Boston.
Tom got Mary's autograph.
You may go in now.
Mary pretended she was her older sister.
I thought you didn't know.
I want to know your name.
I hope you're in a safe place.
Don't depend on it.
Tom can swim as fast as Mary.
This is my son's CD.
I heard that Tom is going to Boston.
I want to make one thing clear.
Are you sure you don't want to move to Boston?
I want to buy a wool sweater.
My sister is playing with a doll.
I'm not disagreeing.
A man must be honest.
Put handcuffs on him.
Tom said that nobody was fired.
Tom felt someone touch his shoulder.
I love to see Tom smile.
"Tom is ready, I think."
It's under the table.
Do you know whose skis these are?
He's about the same age as you.
I want to tell you about Tom.
"Why do you say one thing, and then go and do another?"
Hang your coat on the hook.
He is eating.
It's not going to be easy.
I knew Tom would be late.
We don't have that in Europe.
We found footprints in the sand.
Do you have any aspirin?
I had no idea what was happening.
Anybody may participate.
The Japanese population is shrinking.
I have lost my keys.
What are the advantages of this technology?
Who were you going to sell it to?
Who's your favorite composer?
Do you want to see your room?
Tom won't be able to solve his problems alone.
She bought him some candy.
You'll get better.
Tom used to work in Australia.
I don't think Tom knows why Mary isn't here.
I'll send Tom a postcard.
Do you really want to spend the rest of your life in prison?
I don't think that Tom can really do that.
I can't accept your invitation.
I can't trust anyone.
Don't forget to attach your photo to the application form.
I remember that laugh.
There are so many people here in Tokyo.
Everyone's thirsty.
We must stop this.
I feel like vomiting.
You're not helping me.
I'll be able to see him next year.
"If you could have three wishes, what would you wish for?"
Please don't ask me to do this again.
I was close to Tom.
Tom said he felt terrible.
Do you really think it's important?
"I could've refused to do that, but I didn't."
That wasn't the main reason why Tom wanted to do that.
We're diplomatic.
I was happy to see him.
It was supposed to be quiet here.
I'll catch a ride with Tom.
Tom isn't a teacher.
We're safe here.
I used to like Boston.
It's not the job.
Tom made a full recovery.
You can start anytime.
"After a while, Tom started to believe his own lies."
Feed the hamster.
Make sure that the first coat of paint is dry before applying the second coat.
Can't you see the door's closed?
What're you drinking?
You should appreciate that.
The fighting grew bloodier.
When will you come?
I have a job to do.
That's the worst thing you can do!
Tom claims that he knows nothing about that.
Don't disturb me!
You don't have the right.
Tom helped Mary take off her jacket.
I wasn't forced to do that.
I know Tom isn't a genius.
Does Tom know you're going to do that?
Tom has been told about the problem already.
I have to leave early.
What do you regret most?
That's what I'm trying to do.
Tom dashed off a note to Mary.
It began to rain and she got wet.
I can't believe Tom was an undercover cop.
Tom left a note in Mary's locker.
It's too soon to tell.
Everyone ignored Tom.
We must make sure that this information is correct.
Why don't you ask Tom yourself?
Tom won't ever be able to win again.
Tom begged me to wait.
Please delete this file.
My wife is a doctor.
Have you seen Tom around?
"You're about my age, I think."
Have you been told when to come?
You must run.
Is it already open?
What happened this morning?
It must have been broken during shipping.
I'm married to a lawyer.
Tom can't speak French.
Tom said this could happen.
Keep it warm.
This should be washed.
Fill the bucket up with sand.
I was watching TV when the phone rang.
I think that guy looks like Tom.
"I'm sorry, but I don't speak French very well."
Tom isn't the only one who was late.
I live here alone.
Tom interrupted Mary.
Tom and Mary understood each other.
Tom wanted to forget about what happened.
I can't permit this to continue.
She advised him to go there.
That's very possible.
This rule cannot be applied to that case.
It was your own fault.
You made Tom very happy.
I'm a few minutes early.
Help yourself to more cookies.
Tom threw a tantrum.
Tom gently kissed his daughter on the forehead.
This is a vowel.
Nobody can foresee when the war will end.
Tom will spend the rest of his life in prison.
"In New York, the dollar was worth eight shillings."
Tom's daughter was murdered.
He was invited to be the chairman of the club.
Thousands of candles illuminated the church during the ceremony.
Tom was in a good mood yesterday.
Tom likes chocolate very much.
It's 2:30.
Tom sent Mary a postcard.
Tom never said he'd go with us.
The doctor's presence has been requested elsewhere.
Pitch the ball to me.
I don't like anything here.
It's the only way.
I don't think that Tom did that on purpose.
Why don't you get a haircut?
I'm going to leave the three of you alone.
I did that already.
I think of you as a friend.
Tom only won one race.
Everybody likes him.
I am peeling apples.
John has gone cuckoo.
Tom often wins.
Tom liked teasing Mary.
Tom shut his notebook.
I probably won't be home tomorrow.
What he likes is jelly.
How do I know that you're not going to try to kill me?
Tom has never lived anywhere other than Australia.
I want to play cards.
Mary has beautiful brown eyes.
What's your verdict?
I'm a consultant.
Who's Tom talking about?
I want to dedicate this song to Tom.
"Look, I'm really busy."
Tom knew Mary was busy.
The children were sitting on the floor in front of Tom.
Did you really eat everything?
You're wounded.
Woman's intuition is clearly a valuable trait.
Professor Hudson is my father's friend.
Tom didn't want to make the same mistake as Mary.
Where are you going?
I'm tired of your nagging.
Mary ironed her blouse.
Please promise me you'll never lie again.
My boss has a grudge against me.
They lost their dog.
I'm useless.
I understand why Tom didn't want to do that.
Wait a sec.
Tom is outside watering the flowers.
I wouldn't want to take that risk.
Go and see Tom in person.
Tom has money problems.
He is watching TV now.
Finding his office was easy.
I visited Boston.
"Walk faster, or you'll miss the train."
That happened three days ago.
You shouldn't have worried so much.
You were told to stay on the ship.
You don't have to apologize to me.
I dated Mary for three years.
I'm all thumbs in the kitchen.
He also needs many workers.
Something is wrong with my typewriter.
We have a lot of snow here in winter.
Tom still loves you.
I'm sorry for shouting at you.
Tom wiped his hands on his trousers.
I'll stay with Tom.
Catch me if you can.
You need to rest.
What time do you usually leave for work?
Don't you want to see the house?
How could you say yes without consulting me?
What quantity of paper do you need?
I'd do that differently.
"Tom, there's something I want to give you."
Do you really care what they think?
You're not fooling anybody.
Aren't you Canadian?
You never should've gone to Boston.
Climb onto the roof.
The cat woke up.
He may have been right.
We both know whose fault this is.
Tom was afraid of hurting Mary.
"You always say that you'll take out the garbage, but you never do."
Who sent you here?
I don't have a present for Tom yet.
Tom blushed a little and changed the subject.
I tripped over a stone.
How could you help Tom?
I have confidence in his abilities.
I bought a watch the other day. It keeps good time.
I still hate you.
The road was blocked.
Tom guessed my weight.
I'll ask Tom to wait until Mary arrives.
I can't speak French as well as you.
How are your parents?
What are you going to play?
We could both go.
Do you want to take this one?
That's the way I was raised.
He did not agree with it.
Do you know Tom's brother?
I wish I could join you.
You should come with us.
Success can only be achieved through hard work.
It's difficult to talk to Tom.
We really need to talk to you.
Who's your uncle?
Tom loafed around the house.
I'm a member of the sales department.
Did you do this on your own?
There are many parks in Boston.
Tom seldom speaks to me anymore.
It can be improved.
Why do people like Tom so much?
His employer dismissed him yesterday.
We could do that.
Move over.
Tom is always grumbling.
I don't know much more than that.
Be careful with that knife.
I see that Tom trusts you.
The train leaves in 5 minutes.
Tom said that you would understand.
How many weeks ago did that happen?
I couldn't answer all of the questions.
I can't move my leg.
A face appeared at the window.
How do you know so much about it?
I think you can do it without my help.
I won the bet.
He frequently jumps from one topic to another while he is talking.
I want you all out of here.
They're both empty.
How many apple trees are there in your orchard?
Is Tom married?
Tom's neighbors called the police.
The boy showed off his new bicycle to everyone.
Tom failed to escape.
I am not eating.
Put your phone down.
"Excuse me, I have to get off at the next stop."
Tom is patient with me.
I just wouldn't do that.
Finish your work quickly.
You must be very proud of your children.
Give me a minute.
Don't misunderstand my words.
I'm sure Tom can do it.
Do you know how old I am?
I hope that everything is going to be OK.
Did you read the instructions?
She is very fast.
Could I ask you to do that again?
Tom was born three months ago.
Are you paying attention?
Tom called Mary.
I'll let Tom know that you called.
Who bought you this?
Tom and I have three kids.
The kids will be happy to see you.
Why do you want to leave?
When did your family arrive in Boston?
Tom said that I had to study French.
Was Tom with you?
"As soon as I find out, I'll let you know."
I don't recall asking you for help.
How did you come by such a job?
"Ladies and gentlemen, please stand for the national anthem of the Russian Federation performed by the Sretensky Monastery Choir."
Is that your mother?
That isn't wine. It's just grape juice.
Tom was singing a song.
Do you really think that Tom had nothing to do with what happened?
I was afraid to do that alone.
"Just don't tell anyone, OK?"
Which one's yours?
Please give me another chance.
This cap belongs to Tom.
I thought she was sick.
I'm assuming you have a plan.
Tell her not to get near the dog.
I had to go back home.
"Sorry, I don't have any money."
I met her three days ago.
I can come back if you want me to.
Now calm down.
I saw Tom kiss Mary.
Nothing is wrong with Tom.
I'll tell you how to do it.
Do you have money?
Did you really steal this food?
We haven't learned how to do that yet.
I think that I understand.
I told you we should've waited for Tom.
You'll be safe here.
Where did you decide to go?
I erased my name off the list.
You need to grow up.
I broke the window.
Didn't Tom wait for you?
Why did you cancel your trip?
Did you get his letter?
I don't think Tom knows where Mary parked her car.
Tom didn't want to stay.
I have a lot of friends here.
If only it were that simple.
Can you recommend a good book?
Tom has quit smoking.
Do you want me to try it again?
I admire your talent.
Tom said he would buy it.
I didn't have a very good time.
Tom wanted to leave early.
He started laughing hysterically.
Let's throw all this stuff away.
I can explain it.
We don't know exactly where Tom is.
You must all leave.
Tom is putting on his shoes.
I've already tried it.
Have you found an apartment yet?
How did that get in here?
A leopard can't change its spots.
How long have you worked here?
I think we're safe for a while.
We plan to name our son Tom.
How much longer is Tom planning to live in Boston?
Do you know what his name is?
I'm the only witness.
Tom has been caught.
China is much larger than Japan.
I don't follow you.
I think I'll be able to stand that.
Didn't you know Tom was living on Park Street?
I told Tom to leave you alone.
Can you do it faster?
I even wrote a letter to Tom.
I feel a little awkward.
That sounds great.
Was there anybody else in the bar?
Tom told me Mary wasn't thirsty.
I wonder what this is.
It's under the bed.
Who doesn't care about money?
We're surprised.
I'm sure you'll agree with me.
A stranger spoke to me on the crowded bus.
She keeps a record of everything she buys.
Butter is made from milk.
What was the difference?
He was picked up by a passing ship.
I'll take care of the horses.
Tom is secretly in love with Mary.
Tom realizes he's made a mistake.
Tom was unaware of what had happened.
Can you open the door from your side?
You must do what seems right to you.
This is by far the best seafood restaurant in this area.
Tom is going to Australia on October 20th.
Stop babbling.
This is how I solved the problem.
Tom has three other dogs.
I might be able to help.
I couldn't figure out what Tom was going to do.
Tom didn't like that.
Has anyone talked to Tom about this?
I hope we get paid extra for doing that.
Did you really expect Tom to tell you the truth?
Tom loved doing that.
In one year there are more than thirty-one million seconds.
I'm moving across the country.
Please don't ask me to do that.
I don't like hot tubs.
Tom and Mary came up with a possible solution to their problem.
Let's start with Tom.
I've changed it.
Nobody really knows.
Do you want me to translate?
Tom forced me to do it.
You can't blame me for that.
Tom said Mary was unlucky.
Thank you for coming to see me.
"We're going to need your help, aren't we?"
Tom knows all about it already.
Talk to your friends.
Stop bragging.
Are you completely out of your mind?
I told you I don't know how to do that.
Keep it in mind.
Tom often comes to Boston.
I'm here to help you.
Tom used to be a lawyer.
I sometimes steal stuff.
Will you be in Boston next week?
The mic is yours.
You try too hard.
Which party do you belong to?
Tom couldn't keep from laughing.
"When I die, I want to be buried next to her."
I'm afraid it's going to rain tomorrow.
Don't you have anything better to do with your time?
Peel the apple before you eat it.
Tom is afraid of dogs.
I'm not allowed to go there.
Tom couldn't stop crying.
How many times a week do you do that?
I will do my homework.
These birds migrate to North Africa in the winter.
Do you really think it's possible?
Tom answered all of Mary's questions.
Tom thought that Mary was still outside.
I didn't eat all the cookies.
"During the night, Tom heard a strange noise."
She sat on the bank.
She's stark naked.
Can you explain why Tom isn't here?
The situation is complicated.
I usually eat at school.
Tom deserved the punishment.
Tom claims he won.
Let's party.
I've got quite a lot of hats.
Tom will die in prison.
He objected to our plan.
I'm going again tomorrow.
I knew better than to trust Tom.
"What's the problem, Tom?"
What are you doing here so early?
Where else are you going to go?
How did you know Tom was going to go to Boston with Mary?
"Tom doesn't eat pork, does he?"
I lost the book you lent me.
Is it all over?
Tom calls Mary once in a while.
"What's wrong? ""My computer just crashed."""
Water boils at one hundred degrees Celsius.
You must be very proud of your son.
She turned down his invitation.
I know Tom is busy today.
I was in the house.
The Cold War began after World War Two.
I hope you don't take this the wrong way.
That's what I want to find out.
Tom is an open book.
I don't think Tom is going to like doing that.
You're breaking the law.
I don't know what'll happen now.
Will you miss Tom?
I had to send Tom home.
Please write a letter to me.
Won't you change your mind?
Tom abandoned hope.
I speak French fairly well.
The hunter was skinning the deer.
She accepted our invitation.
What did you do this summer?
Tom opened the apartment door and walked in.
Do you know who he is?
Tom hated his own name.
He has a talent for music.
I never mentioned it.
I was irked.
My cup's empty.
I'll keep watch.
We need you to baby-sit.
Malaria is a disease that mosquitoes carry.
My parents love each other.
I want to see that movie again.
"He didn't notice the change, but I did."
We have breakfast in the kitchen.
Let me show you.
Neither Tom nor Mary has been fired.
Tom would like that.
I was at home all day yesterday.
Why does nobody eat my potatoes?
Tom and Mary aren't married.
The two countries have broken off diplomatic relations.
Which floor do you live on?
What Tom said hurt Mary's feelings.
You ought to be quiet in a library.
Why are you so stupid?
They're having fun.
This one's broken.
Tom smiled when he saw me.
Tom said that you speak French better than Mary.
I'll be ready in about thirty minutes.
Tom caught a big fish.
Tom knows Australia.
We lost everything.
Tom didn't tell me why he was going to Boston.
The actress said that she was engaged to a banker.
Come the day after tomorrow.
This car is Tom's.
Tom is a skillful driver.
What floor is your office on?
We have ample time to catch our train.
Whose glasses are these?
Do you want to wear a kimono?
Are you afraid of the truth?
Tom asked Mary about her life in Australia.
Read this book.
Tom was waiting for me at the gate.
I know what you did.
This beer is bitter.
Tom is worried.
Tom wanted to know why Mary didn't like him.
I found it.
Seize him!
He is like a father to me.
Tom still sleeps with a teddy bear.
I told Tom not to be late.
I think you know where we need to go.
She listened to music for hours.
We're no different from anyone else.
Tom now knows what to do.
Tom smiled again.
All of my ex-girlfriends live in Australia.
Tom said that he didn't have enough time to make his own lunch.
That was pretty difficult to do.
Tom gave me 300 dollars.
Tom drank a glass of red wine.
He studies Chinese.
Maybe Tom can help us.
You did something incredibly stupid.
He has two sisters who both live in Kyoto.
Maybe Tom doesn't know why we're here.
We really need to talk to you.
I know that I'm right.
I know what love is.
I didn't know what to buy.
What was Tom talking about?
How long has it been since you talked to Tom?
I felt strong.
I want another cup of coffee.
Tom doesn't like loud music.
I didn't think you'd talk to me.
I think Tom is only pretending to be asleep.
"Well, what's wrong with that?"
"If you know where Tom lives, tell me."
I told you never to do that again.
Tom's knees buckled.
You're a nice person.
You're joking!
No one is asking you to eat that.
I have a lot of patients.
Do all of you speak French?
Who's it for?
Tom is a singing teacher.
Please shut up.
I know you want to talk to Tom.
I don't like to eat fish with many bones.
Both brothers were there.
Did you see what Tom just did?
I told you this was going to be dangerous.
You'd better not drink the tap water.
I have a lot of patients who are older than me.
His speech lasted three hours.
"You were right, too."
When can I do that?
I'm leaving Boston tomorrow.
Tom gave Mary one of his guitars.
"That was my idea, not Tom's."
How did you know Tom would be here?
You should speak with Tom.
Here is your bill.
I miss you already.
You looked scared.
Your comments made Tom laugh.
I'm happy for you.
Do any of your friends smoke?
I didn't know that you were Tom's brother.
Do they work here?
I think it tastes good.
I can do nothing for you.
The older boys are always playing tricks on him.
He ignored her advice.
Can you believe it? She's even lazier than me.
Tom visited Mary yesterday.
Tom showed it to Mary.
I understand you have a problem.
Tom will always love you.
Tom is looking for adventure.
I thought we weren't going to do this.
Tom didn't want me to leave.
Can you tell us about Tom?
A great man doesn't care about his appearance.
Antibiotics are a cure for infection.
Don't forget that.
My opinion about Tom hasn't changed.
Do you have a copy of the new schedule?
I'll miss you when you're gone.
There's one more.
I have a very small nose.
I will translate.
Tom didn't have to yell at me.
I bought it for about twelve dollars.
Could you lend me some money until this weekend?
I feel sorry for your kids.
I don't want to see Tom anymore.
Why were you so surprised?
We discussed the article I published.
We are influenced both by environment and by heredity.
You'd like it.
You're a teacher now.
Tom has two brothers. One lives in Boston and the other one lives in Chicago.
It was not until yesterday that I learned the truth.
Won't you help Tom?
Why don't you just read the instructions?
Tom and Mary are still best friends.
I placed the medicine out of the children's reach.
I'll be very busy next month.
He was satisfied with the result.
Why don't you want to tell us the truth?
I've visited Australia once.
I told Tom to hurry up.
Did Tom ever ask you out?
He is an army officer.
You never told me that you liked Tom.
There's only one clean cup.
This theory is too difficult for me to comprehend.
"Prior to your arrival, he left for London."
Tom could see nobody.
Wash the shirt in soapy water and the stains will come out.
Tom doesn't want to continue working for us.
Try not to make any noise.
I remember what you said last night.
Our team lost the first match.
Tom found Mary's constant criticism of him hard to cope with.
What's happening next week?
It'll be very hard to impress Tom.
They moved ahead slowly.
Let's go again.
I need to be at work by 7:30.
I pretended I didn't understand.
Don't stop now.
Just exactly what do you want me to do?
Do you have any idea what you've done?
How many years have you been married?
The awning provides shelter from the rain.
Do you think it'll snow?
Tom should tell Mary what to buy.
"If I'm late, I'll be scolded."
I hear you're good at French.
Tom was on cloud nine.
Did you take the money?
Tom hugged Mary.
I want to get rid of all these things.
Wait a little longer.
Where were you in 2003?
There's no reason for you to apologize.
I accept the challenge.
Tom wanted to be a professional musician.
Tom neither smokes nor drinks.
I had some work that needed finishing.
It's nice to be alone.
Are you going to Tom's birthday party?
Tom didn't waste much time.
I learned a lot.
Don't you know his name?
What should we do today?
Tom was eager to see Mary again.
Three people have been arrested.
When do you want to eat?
Tom asked Mary to pass him the salt and pepper.
I knew it would come in handy.
We succeeded in doing that.
I hate it when they do that.
Tom is certain to succeed.
I often visit Tom on Mondays.
Tom and Mary are on their honeymoon.
It was amazingly easy.
"You're Canadian, right?"
I know he left for London.
Why did you buy a turtle?
Mary showed up at school wearing a nice dress.
Someone has been in my room.
We're not married yet.
We sat in the center of the room.
Do you have a dog?
Tom was the one who told me to do that.
There was a fight.
That's why I don't like you.
Tom and Mary went on a two week honeymoon to Hawaii.
Do you play the saxophone?
Tom hasn't gone to bed yet.
Tom told Mary he didn't trust her.
No one knows what has become of her.
Are you breathing?
Can I come with Tom?
I like the way you make scrambled eggs.
Tom doesn't have an umbrella.
Did you just call me fat?
Didn't you know Tom was planning to go to Australia with Mary?
What do you want me to say?
His name isn't Tom.
Tom is very upset by this.
I was vaccinated against the flu.
Would you like to sing?
Tom knows what this is.
Tom bought a scarf for Mary.
This is the hottest summer we have had in fifty years.
I didn't tell Tom I was married.
He won the next election.
Have you washed the dishes yet?
I didn't kill anyone.
We know how important this is.
They missed the deadline.
We had a lot of fun together.
Didn't you know Tom was in Boston last winter?
I know Tom isn't in bed yet.
He went out to eat.
Consider my offer carefully.
Don't you want to know what I want?
"Hey, look at me."
Why did you stop me?
Are you still in bed?
I'll tell you everything I know.
Tom wanted to ask us a few questions.
I thought you were off today.
Your father is quite tall.
He looked like a doctor.
Tom will be late again.
I forgive you.
Tell me what this means.
You're a kind woman.
Are you a journalist?
Tom said that he wasn't upset.
I didn't want Tom to resign.
Tom and Mary played hide-and-seek.
Matsutake mushrooms are in season now so they are cheap.
I see the way you two look at each other.
Tom was late because he overslept.
You have a wonderful voice.
I'm asking you what you think.
I thought we could help Tom.
Tom has already hired a new lawyer.
A rhetorical question does not require an answer.
This isn't what I wanted.
I forgot to thank Tom for his help.
I don't remember how this movie ends.
The helicopter took off.
Tom went to Australia.
I don't like camping. Do you like camping?
Tom made up that story.
No one had a flashlight.
I promise I won't be late again.
"It was my error, not Tom's."
Did Tom come with you?
Do you think I should do this?
Should I wait for Tom?
We'd love to work with you.
What time does school start in the morning?
How much did you pay for the dress?
Do you want to go to prison?
I think Tom has gone away.
You did what you had to do.
What's your favorite cold weather drink?
Can you buy one for me as well?
I spent three months in Boston.
I'll surprise you.
"Please be on time. If you're late, we'll leave without you."
Call me immediately after you meet him.
Tom drinks coffee.
Don't rush me.
This is all I ever wanted.
Tom is untidy.
You promised not to do that anymore.
Do you really think Tom has to do that?
I prefer swimming to skiing.
That's the answer.
Is there anything to drink in the fridge?
It's not unusual for Tom to be late.
These are the decisions we've made.
What crime did you commit?
An elephant has a long nose.
My time is running out.
Talk to me!
Tom didn't do that and I didn't either.
What's your French teacher's name?
Tom took a bottle of pills out of his pocket.
I'm soaking wet.
I won't have enough time for everything I want to do.
I can teach you how to write.
His interests clash with mine.
It's not secure.
The train is arriving soon.
"This watch cost 70,000 yen."
Are you calling from Australia?
I can sing.
Tom will go as well.
We enjoyed watching the baseball game.
Fill out the questionnaire.
Tom ate the entire bag of nachos.
Do you like the plan?
I won't regret it.
Who is acting as head?

Tom started to laugh.
May I take a bath?
"You ought to blame yourself, not the others, for the failure."
Where exactly did you go?
It wouldn't be fair.
Tom walked out of the kitchen.
Let's go inside.
Why didn't you tell me before?
You don't have to apologize to me.
Many moons orbit around Saturn.
I think Tom is sleeping.
Would you please quit asking me that?
Didn't you know that Tom had a house in Australia?

I don't think it'll get better.
Does Tom know all this?
That's a little vague.

I'm very happy to see you again.
Three times five is fifteen.
One of us has to do this.

What exactly are you trying to prove?
There is a flower on the table.
Tom knew perfectly well what he was doing.
Are you sure you're sick?
Who was that man waiting outside?
He was attracted by her smile.
No one will believe them.

When will you leave?
They're having the same problems we are.
Tom said he's forgotten how to do that.
My luggage hasn't arrived yet.
I forgot that today was April Fool's Day.
Tom looks happy.
They all got into the car.
I think you should sit.
Aren't you going to call the police?
"Tom speaks not only French, but also English."
Tom has long hair and wears glasses.
I don't want to play cards.
Of course.
I'm the one who asked you where Tom was.

I've never seen anything like this.
They made me swear not to say anything.
Go play tennis with Tom.
I just can't help you this time.

I want you to cook dinner tonight.
His father has never scolded him.
Tom likes music.

I awoke from a long dream.
I lent my pencil to Tom.
I think we should go with you.
Tom didn't disappoint me.
Tom was home on Monday.
Tom shivered.
Are you aware of what's happened?
Take an umbrella with you.
You're weak.
The only seat left was next to Tom.
You're the only one who can convince Tom.
Who told you where to find me?
He promised me that he wouldn't tell anybody.
What were her final words?
Where did you eat?

I don't want to be like that.

Tom couldn't remember what they'd been talking about.
You can't be late this time.
Can you help?
Please don't force me to eat that.
"We have a dog, a cat and three canaries."
You have dishonored the family.
I'm obedient.
No weapon was found.
The noise of the heavy traffic kept me awake all night.
"You're sick, aren't you?"
Let me go to Boston with you.
You're fashionable.
I bought that book for you.
Don't you want to help?
I think we're all going to be there.
Are you sure no one's around?
I remember where we first met.
Tom always sits in the front.
I want you to drive.

I'm really looking forward to tonight's concert.
I'm sorry I couldn't write to you sooner.
Look what we've found.

I totally understand.
I know nothing about robotics.
"By the way, what do you do?"
When are you leaving for Boston?
I know you like chocolate.
There are rumors that he will resign.
How did you hit upon such an idea?
Tom has already introduced himself.
They know who they are.
It was very cold yesterday morning.
We don't need Tom's permission.
Please stop singing.

I'm up.
Tom owns about thirty guitars.
Give peace a chance.
Tom is hoping you'll win.

I'm afraid that you're in danger.
Have you gone crazy?
Don't make this decision today.
Tom was ready to do that.
I'll have to ask you to leave.
I took the first step.
Someone's knocking.
I looked him in the eyes.
Can you sing?
You're very selfish.
Did you find the book you were looking for?
I've been silent for a long time.
Tom forgot to set his alarm clock.
Are you having fun?
Do you want me to leave you alone?
You'll never guess where I've been all morning.
That's a hard question.
She's a middle-aged fat woman.
Tom spoke highly of you.
I'll see you when I get back.
Tom was very attentive.
I'm sure that's wrong.

Please do so.

Don't stand up.
Tom found a job for me.
Tom is a pediatrician.
This is the book Tom was talking about yesterday.
The house went cheap.
"Just as he was going out, there was a great earthquake."

"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to frighten you."
He wrote a letter yesterday.
You don't have to shout at the top of your voice.
You can't prove that.
Tom is well aware of Mary's problems.
We've been to Boston many times.

What are you cleaning?
My knife is broken.
Things are not what they seem.
I was a bit afraid.
They say that you were wrong.
Everybody started to panic.
The food was finger-licking good.
How can they stop us?
"No matter how many people tell Tom he made a mistake, he still insists he's right."
Tom said that he wasn't ambidextrous.
Who are these presents for?
I know Tom is a doctor.
I like to complain about the weather.
Tom shot and missed.
There's something I want to show you.
One acquires bad habits very easily.

I'm sure you're very busy.
I don't know much about linguistics.

I'm going to stay with my uncle in Boston.
Tom must love you.
I don't want to hurt anyone.
I'll be careful.
What was the problem?
"Last summer, I moved to Boston from Chicago."
You ought to ask for your teacher's permission.
I don't know where Boston is.
I thought it would never happen.
Tom is being kept in custody.
I used to have a girlfriend.
We're ready.
They never pay any attention to me.

I was thinking about Tom.
I realized it was a mistake.
Do you know what he has done?

Tom will come to save us.
You must help your mother.
Tom is able to skate.
I think there's someone in here.
Let's speak in English.
That's something to be proud of.
The eagle flew away.
Tom asked for Mary's advice.
He got the highest grade on the exam.
I think I've met you before.
They called him a coward.
"Your English is grammatically correct, but sometimes what you say just doesn't sound like what a native speaker would say."
The dog barked at Tom.
Do you really think it'll work?
You have to call Tom.
I'm fed up with this system.
Who are you talking about?
Aren't you bored yet?
Why don't you show Tom around town?
He is my uncle.
You look kind of down.
I didn't think it was important.
He runs fast.
Tom's eyes were closed.
It looks hideous.
I won't come.
What happens if you press this button?
Tom may be back soon.
Take a look at these.
Tom had no right to treat Mary that way.
Those who chase two rabbits at once will catch neither.
You've already forgotten.
I would like to know how much it costs.
He misses his family.
Tom can run fast.
I want you to go.
Soap helps remove the dirt.
I don't know whether you are telling the truth or not.
Tom looked at me.
Please air the room.
Don't say a word to anyone.
How did you convince Tom not to leave?
Could you just turn around for a second?
"Boys, don't make any noise."
When were you born?
Are we talking about the same person?

We will finish it.
Who needs rhetorical questions?
Tom is a screenwriter.
Tom said he regrets not doing that.
I'm going home now.
He finally reached the hotel.
I wouldn't do it if I were you.
They sell meat at this store.
I think it sounds good.
You have to sit down.
"Tom didn't want to hear about all of Mary's problems, but he sat quietly and listened."
Tom has got to be here someplace.
Tom is your father.
I'll pay whatever it costs.
How do you like your coffee?
Tom always makes me laugh.
I have the feeling Tom did that.
I don't have any free time today.
The vase that Tom gave me is made of glass.
Tell me about your daily life.
Tom has a tough job.
"She said to herself, ""Where shall I go next?"""
I've never seen a car this old in such good condition.
Did Tom know you were going to do this?
I'd like to say a few words.
Look at that tall building.
Promise me you won't laugh.
This store doesn't stay open as late as I'd like.
I'm very healthy.
How could you be so irresponsible?

Enjoy life while you may.
Isn't that so?
Tom is like that.
Tom did it last year.
Tom almost never watches TV.
He managed to climb the mountain.
You're inventive.
I hope everything is going to be OK.
We don't know how to find Tom.
You said we were friends.
What makes you think Tom is my type?
Tom doesn't want Mary to know he doesn't know what to do.
Why's Tom laughing?
Tom is approximately the same age as you.
She introduced her sister to me.
Tom knew no one.
Tom admitted that what he did was wrong.
He invested a lot of money in stocks.
Tom is waiting in your office.
He will come back when he gets hungry.
"To our surprise, he was defeated in the match."
I need my tools to fix it.
I wonder what's going on.
I hope Tom will follow my advice.
We're going out for a meal on Friday.
I'm afraid to be alone.
You've been cleared of all charges.
You have to do what you think's right.
Tom's not a baby anymore.
How do you pronounce your name?
We're all ready.
Don't worry. Tom will forgive you.
Everybody paid.
How is the patient this morning?
We close at 2:30.
I already know you did that.
It's on the table.
Tom took a few steps forward.
I'm not sure if I'm right.
I only weigh 45 kilograms.
I didn't know Tom and you were cousins.
The game is rigged.
Tom left his son a lot of money.
I knew Tom didn't care about Mary.
Everybody was anxious.
I think Tom looks ridiculous.
You know nothing.
My doctor told me that I should eat more.
I'll do that the way you showed me.
Maybe he is Italian or Spanish.
The day we arrived was a holiday.
You lean on your parents too much. You must be more independent.
Tom's room was very clean.
I'm just so happy.
What's your favorite shampoo?
What do you want to talk to me about?
Here are some pictures.
What is Tom trying to tell me?
Do you believe that?
It was very kind of you to lend me an umbrella.
I can't stand violence.
We're your friends.
I don't like your boss.
Tom and Mary are planning a picnic at the lake.
Tom said that he didn't want me to help Mary.
I don't really know.
The door wasn't open.
Do you think this might happen again?
Why didn't you say anything before?
Health workers aid people in need.
We discussed the matter with each other.
I have been looking for lemon juice all day long.
Tom urged Mary to resign.
You should go.
"I bought Tom's old car for $3,000."
Tom is a cat lover.
It's so nice to finally meet you.
I hope that I never have to do that again.
Please don't quit.
Tom explained why he was there.
I have another good idea.
I've already eaten.
I heard Tom singing.
I don't belong here.
I still haven't apologized to Tom.
Is that pure gold?

Tom doesn't have long to live.
I'm going to leave.
Tom doesn't want to speak to you.
Tom wanted to see Mary again.
Tom wondered why everyone was staring at him.
We haven't run out of medicine yet.
That's a pretty hard question to answer.
I don't think anybody else wants to do that.
Tom doesn't like to eat onions.
I'm still awake.
He was completely absorbed in the book.
I'll let you know all about it later on.
I think I'm going to die soon.
He has gone to the library.
Your hair is pretty.
I'm a loser.
I need a pencil. May I use one of yours?
Tom did almost all of the work by himself.
Tom understands French a lot better than everyone thinks he does.
Is that so difficult?
Tom is in his mid-thirties.
Tom is on the roof.
Which is cheaper?
Let's ask Tom.
I will fight to the death.
We don't deserve this.
Can you close the drapes?
Show it to them.
Why not just tell Tom?
I'll come and see you one of these days.
I'm going to Boston next spring.
I'll find out myself.
Your situation isn't hopeless.
Do you really want to go to Boston with me?
Tom won't be here until 2:30.
I'll pay you back next week.
I just sang a couple of songs with Tom.
Take an aspirin.
There's no one in the house.
She is by no means stupid.
"You'll find a solution, I'm sure."
I don't care what color your skin is.
We've tried everything.
I knew there would be something to eat.
I don't feel like doing anything.
Tom says he isn't ready to go.
Tom knows where we live.
It was on the list.
Tom decided to become a pilot.
You need to come with us.
I think Tom will like that.
Take care not to catch a cold.
Tom doesn't like mathematics.
The defense rests.
"So, how does it feel to be a father?"
Please say hello to your wife for me.
I couldn't protect Tom.
Do you think so?
I'm expecting Tom to win.
What exactly will it cost?
We have many good friends.
Didn't I tell you to take out the garbage?
I don't think Tom was here.
I don't like to make a mistake.
Perhaps Tom and Mary are more than just friends.
He left the door unlocked.
My suit is grey.
"Let's get this over with, once and for all."
All the boys went away.
Everything's working fine.
Tom is the same age as Mary.
Tom is playing with my cat.
I don't think that Tom will be busy tomorrow.
Tom looked very guilty.
We are not here for fun and games.
Tom said he liked the movie.
She cared for the children after the death of their mother.
Why don't you take a break?
Don't leave it open.
Why did you go into the cave?
Some people think French is really hard to learn.
That's a lot!
It isn't much fun to do that.
He got into the habit of smoking in his youth.
I need to know where to put this.
"Compared to those around him, he looked really happy."
Would you like to try?
I don't think that Tom will ever forgive me.
President Jackson did not agree.
It never happens to me.
You almost stepped on the dog's tail.
I told you to stop calling me that.
I wish I'd never met Tom.
Let's shake hands and be friends.
Tom had one goal.
You don't have time.
Tom knows Mary better than anyone else.
Tom wanted to buy a leather belt.
He put a cap on his head.
We know Tom was strangled.
There is no knowing what he will do next.
That is a strange sentence.
I don't have the will power to quit smoking.
Tom was elected in 2013.
It's not that interesting.
Tom met Mary at school.
Mary hasn't cut the meat yet.
"Excuse me, which way is the post office?"
Both Tom and I almost died in the accident.
Tom blamed himself for Mary's death.
Where is her house?
The city of Boston has one of the best children's hospitals in the United States.
I was very hungry.
Do you think Tom would wait?
"Excuse me, I'm lost."
I showed it to Tom.
They're awfully nosy.
Choose one from among these.
Everyone's laughing.
I've been told to help you.
I've got things under control now.
Tom and Mary never agree on anything.
You will always be welcome.
Doing that is very important.
I wasn't surprised at all.
When was the last time you cried?
Tom is likely to die tonight.
Tom said he was adopted.
What more do you want from me?
Let's sit at the same table.
I'll call you when I'm ready.
"Tom is still at home, isn't he?"
The shoes you are wearing look rather expensive.
Why do you hate Canadians so much?
He just moved into an apartment he inherited from his parents.
I don't live in Boston now.
Get me something to drink.
My garden is small.
I asked Tom what he wanted for Christmas.
Why aren't you wearing a tie?
"Tom used to smoke, but now he doesn't."
I thought Tom would understand.
That's the key.
Tom's novel has been translated into French.
Germany is one of Europe's most beautiful countries.
His joke eased the tension in the room.
Tom is standing in front of the door.
Why are you home now?
She lost both her parents.
What kind of women do you like?
Tom was hoping to see Mary.
Tom was too tired to continue working.
Tom lost his boarding pass.
It's cold today.
You aren't perfect.
Thanks for doing the dishes.
That doesn't interest us at all.
"I'll call you tomorrow, OK?"
I'd be happy to sing for you.
Nobody said anything to us.
You would like it.
Tom carefully wiped his fingerprints off the knife.
I went to sleep during the lesson.
You seem to have mistaken me for my older brother.
You're not that old.
I have done a good job.
I didn't expect you to be here.
I think that Tom doesn't want to tell us the truth.
Tom is almost thirty.
I only did my duty.
I'd like to see your father.
"I'm not so busy, either."
Tom just talked to me.
You're not a loser.
My television is broken.
I think it's better to stay here.
Tom started talking.
Do you have anything for a headache?
The word is not in my dictionary.
"Run, or else you'll be late."
Why was Tom fired?
How many ways are there to do that?
I don't want to spend more than $10.
Remember everything.
Can you help me fix it?
I don't think that's a real diamond.
I'm a twin.
Tom is a bit eccentric.
Tom apparently didn't get enough sleep.
Tom wasn't really surprised.
Tom and Mary didn't know each other at that time.
It isn't cold today.
Have a drink.
We'll contact you.
Do you love Tom and me?
I like to observe people.
Tom asked Mary why she did that.
We shouldn't tell Tom about what happened.
Call me when you get home.
When did you and Tom do that?
It depends on you.
This road isn't on the map.
I'd be grateful if you could help me.
Have you ever gotten a speeding ticket?
Tom hung his coat on one of the hooks near the door.
Tom never replied.
Mary's eyes are pretty.
Tom is my enemy.
You're not my type.
We all have our off days.
Tom held his breath.
Tom ordered some food.
Why doesn't Tom have a girlfriend?
You did that on purpose.
Tom didn't tell me who his French teacher was.
I'm sure I can find a job.
He caught a big one.
"You're Tom's wife, aren't you?"
Which instruments do you play?
It's difficult to do that.
Didn't you know that Tom didn't like Mary?
I purchased a new car last year.
She drives me crazy.
My father has been in the hospital for two months.
Wear whatever you want.
There is one thing I don't understand.
A dog has four legs.
You're better than Tom.
The flowers in the vase are beautiful.
Do you want this job or not?
"The bullet penetrated his chest, leaving him in critical condition."
He will get well soon.
You did the right thing by telling us.
I'm having trouble concentrating.
You can go there.
I'm sorry to disappoint you.
Get Tom away from here.
I'll keep it with me.
Where is your luggage?
I'm too lazy to do that.
Can we rent one of these boats?
The boys were quiet.
"If you could loan me some money, I'd really appreciate it."
I think perhaps I can help you.
I lost my wallet somewhere around here.
You didn't need to hurry.
We can't ignore this anymore.
You got here in time.
You need to respect Tom's decision.
People say the same thing about Tom.
I'm not very strong.
That's what we were thinking.
Obviously he is wrong.
What's your favorite restaurant in Boston?
When did you go home?
Tom never knew that.
How many years did you live in Boston?
May I smoke?
Tom confessed.
I can't believe I listened to you.
He has a heart of gold.
I told Tom to do that right away.
Tom is an experienced mountain climber.
Where's Tom going to sleep?
I'll call you when I need you.
I'm writing an article.
Tom even likes cold pizza.
We caught you.
I love adventure.
I don't care if you like me or not.
I don't think there's anybody there.
I may not be busy next Monday.
Losing isn't much fun.
I'll kill you.
Why do you always wear that hat?
I had nothing to do with that.
I hope it'll clear up soon.
Tom and Mary agreed to leave the party before midnight.
Tom couldn't persuade Mary to accept the money.
Why haven't you done that?
Do you want me to finish it?
Are you satisfied with your life?
Can you close the door?
Tom told Mary to tell the truth.
We don't yet know the side effects of the drug.
Tom must have seen where Mary went.
Tom gets upset when Mary doesn't do what he tells her to do.
Tom wasn't able to convince Mary to come back home.
Why do you think Tom hates me?
The students bothered the teacher with silly questions.
Leave the room.
Tom did what I asked him to do.
I put some cream in my coffee.
I thought you were smart.
Tom isn't interested in politics.
She did not return till six.
I don't think it's going to be easy to find Tom.
It was a very romantic kiss.
Tom didn't have the courage to try sky diving.
I was cleaning my room.
What awful weather!
Tom said that he needed money.
I knew you'd been to Boston.
It's snowed a lot.
That's my line!
Tom doesn't like being pushed.
It's a win-win situation.
We both were really drunk.
You never told me that.
The doctor examined the patient.
Tom and Mary talked about John.
I hope you have a lot of time.
I think Tom has already tried doing that.
You're very flexible.
"You're winning, aren't you?"
Can you wait a little?
Please give me one.
I won't move.
I was kidnapped.
Tom says I look like a girl.
Cut it in half.
I don't yet know what to do.
I hope you'll reconsider.
I was surprised to see you here.
It is essential that every child have the same educational opportunities.
I want everyone to know that I'm not the one who did that.
Is Tom's illness serious?
He died doing what he loved.
I love dancing.
Tom didn't know that Mary was interested in classical music.
Tom is the one who gave me Mary's phone number.
Do you want me to leave a light on for you?
I sneeze all the time.
What makes you think that Tom's interested in helping us?
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
I think that everyone already knows that.
A yard is equal to three feet.
This is your fault.
What do you do in Japan?
Tom talks to Mary a lot.
I got the information I needed.
No one asked your opinion.
Don't you want to have another child?
The lecture covered a lot of ground.
Is that your room?
I can do that faster than you.
I wanted you to come.
Give me back my tickets.
Tom really helped me.
That hardly mattered.
A lot of trees were cut down.
There's no need to hurry. We have plenty of time.
It is just your imagination.
Nothing's broken.
Will Tom be in Boston next year?
I totally agree with Tom.
I found the earring that you lost.
The room is very dirty.
Tom doesn't want any pizza.
Tom never told me why he wasn't here the day before yesterday.
Teenagers do a lot of stupid things.
He likes jelly.
You don't understand what's happening.
Tom says he doesn't like weddings.
"Hold on tight, otherwise you will fall off."
I won't get in the way.
I go to the library two or three times a week.
I know Tom's sister.
The zoo is closed on Mondays.
The old chair groaned under her weight.
Where is my umbrella?
Everybody knows who you are.
Tom hopes that he can visit Boston before he dies.
Do you like white wine?
"Whose cats are these? ""They are Fatima's."""
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I thought we were going to win.
"He's English, but lives in India."
"Tom is very smart, isn't he?"
Perhaps you won't have to do that.
She does not like him.
Tom's mother would've been very proud of him.
We all see the same thing.
Please tell me when he'll be back.
We just need a little more time.
I don't understand why Tom acts that way.
He is less strict than our teacher.
Tom has never eaten raw horse meat.
I want Tom to win.
Tom knows we're coming.
This is all a big misunderstanding.
Tom had a little help.
I consented to go.
Tom watched admiringly.
Tom promised me that.
Which do you suppose she chose?
I get the feeling you don't really want me to stay.
Tom got pulled over by the police.
"After the storm, it was calm."
Just pull yourself together.
I've never heard of him before.
I thought that Tom was guilty.
Sit down here and warm yourself.
Tom was interested in that.
Do you have any idea how many people died when the Titanic sunk?
Tom and Mary met three years ago in Boston.
Tom said that it was raining.
The police found Tom's body in his garage.
It's finally Friday.
Mary was left badly scarred after botched plastic surgery.
What subject do you think he is interested in?
There's no need to be embarrassed.
Each member has to pay a membership fee.
I haven't seen Tom since he and Mary broke up.
You owe me.
What are you going to do next week?
I never thought something like that could happen.
Tom was awfully bored.
I was in Boston three weeks ago.
Don't you understand French?
Can you tell us a bit about yourself?
We want to be fair.
It was a standoff.
What's the first thing you're going to do?
Sit there.
There's no room under the bed.
Please take me to Tom.
I just love beautiful women.
Do you believe that good always triumphs over evil?
Tom reloaded his pistol.
No one has told me anything.
Do you know how to tie your shoes?
I suspect that you know why I'm here.
Tom advised Mary to stay away from John.
I can't agree with you on that point.
I thought that you lived in Boston.
Go ahead and try it.
Didn't you know Tom was going to Boston?
You are not in a position to ask for anything.
Don't you get it?
I think you'd be surprised.
Tom beat Mary to death.
Tom wasn't very scared.
Is she gone?
We have to put right what we have done wrong.
I can pay upfront.
I think you're going to like this one.
I voted for Tom.
I want to talk with you.
You have to see them.
She can play the piano very well.
Tom closed his eyes and fell asleep.
He pretends to know everything.
I don't want to talk to you anymore.
We'll wait three hours.
Where did you find this?
Tom said that he didn't want to stay home all day.
I went there today.
We had lunch at noon.
Tom can do things that I can't do.
Give me that one.
I want him to leave.
It smells like something is burning.
Tom dedicated his life to teaching.
Give this copy to Tom.
I like tennis.
I don't think that Tom has to go there by himself.
I'll be happy to answer your question.
Actions are more important than words.
How did you convince Tom to give you so much money?
This medicine helps relieve muscle pain.
How many minutes did it take you to do that?
I hate rules.
I told Tom not to come back.
You won't have to do that today.
I've already apologized to Tom.
I'm the one who gave Tom his guitar.
Your father loves you.
I will buy a car.
I heard you don't like Tom.
I'm not yet ready to be in a serious relationship.
Tom died without leaving a will.
That's not what I said.
Thanks for your gift.
Tom is a smart man.
Tom told me about it.
I'm going to get myself a burger.
I wonder if Tom knows where Mary lives.
These socks do not match.
Tom has to call Mary tomorrow.
"If I were you, I'd talk to Tom."
That's what we need to do.
Tom is our soccer team's goalkeeper.
Don't I even get a phone call?
Did Tom ask you to do that?
The moon is shining.
"It was a pretty little house, strong and well-built."
I weigh a lot less than Tom does.
Love is blinding you.
You can't win.
Tom doesn't like competition.
We painted the walls white.
You have only two options.
Tom and Mary aren't hungry.
I hope Tom will be very happy.
I don't think that this is for you.
I heard the leaves rustling.
It rained for many days.
Tom has already read that book.
I just really want to know what happened.
Tom closed the door quietly and tiptoed into the room.
My car is faster than yours.
I'll pay.
This is one of the basic rules.
That's a new record.
Tom kissed Mary on the cheek.
I didn't know you'd come back.
Nobody wants that.
Tom told us to run.
Your opinion doesn't count.
Don't underestimate Tom.
"Which color do you prefer, blue or green?"
"Don't move, please."
Go put some clean clothes on.
We played basketball yesterday.
"You kept nodding off during that lecture, didn't you?"
I'm beginning to have doubts.
I've decided not to go to Boston with Tom.
Who took care of you?
I came to thank you.
Tom and his friends are swimming in the pool.
I'm not your husband anymore.
Ask me tomorrow.
Are you busy?
I hope you'll get well soon.
I think that I know as much as you do.
Tom gave me something to read.
You missed.
This is how we've got to know each other.
Would you mind if I left early?
They didn't say why.
We'll do this some other time.
Tom was the last person to leave.
You're not obligated to answer that question.
"I wanted to see Tom, too."
It's none of your business.
I'll be there in a sec.
I'm very young compared to Tom.
He stubbed out his cigar in the ashtray and stood up to leave.
Tom didn't buy me what I wanted.
Tom gave the dog a piece of meat.
Tom doesn't want us to come.
She helped me pack my suitcase.
Put on this sweater.
You ought to have taken your father's advice.
I think he was speaking Latin.
I'm a thirty-year-old housewife.
We can't find Tom.
Your tie looks good.
We were late because of the storm.
They expected to win.
There's something burning.
They believe it.
They came in full force.
I'm pretty sure Tom's lying.
It's really personal.
Tom Jackson is the deputy director.
She and I are brother and sister.
I won't allow Tom to go.
Did Tom try to assault you?
Neither Tom nor Mary did that.
I told you Tom isn't my friend.
I wonder how long this cold weather will last.
The police found Tom's body in a shallow grave behind the barn.
Tom is our oldest child and Mary is the youngest.
I thought you were smart.
Tom put down his spoon.
This annoys me very much.
Thank you for inviting me to your birthday party.
Everyone is waiting for you.
You must not say it.
Tom likes swimming a lot.
Have you made friends?
I regret not having bought that house.
Turn left and you will find the cafe.
I tried writing with my left hand.
Tom put his phone away.
I'm sure we can manage that.
"It will be difficult, but not impossible."
I'm feeling OK.
I didn't believe them.
"You speak French, don't you?"
Can I help you with that?
That's all I can give you right now.
Stop lying to me.
I received your letter.
Tom is helping me.
Tom often does things like that.
He made up his mind to go there.
It'll never happen.
Did you discuss it with Tom?
I think that everyone makes mistakes.
Tom took a big breath and blew out the candles.
Things are getting out of hand.
I won't disappoint you.
Tom gave Mary a wink.
They are struggling for freedom.
Stay for a while.
Leeches are still used in medicine today.
Why are you so arrogant?
I thought you'd be ready.
"You're Tom's daughter, aren't you?"
Were they lying?
When did you say that?
Don't get overconfident.
The kids were happy.
It's even worse than I thought.
How many boxes did you unload from the truck?
He bailed on us just when we needed him.
There's nothing obligating you to spend the night here.
Is this going to cost us a lot of money?
I have to go to Boston.
I have studied Italian for a few months.
Tom is tall and skinny.
You must be very hungry.
I like music very much.
"If you don't hurry, you'll miss the train."
I think you're talented.
I'm anorexic.
We meet every Monday night.
Tom isn't afraid to do that anymore.
Listen to me.
Why were you driving Tom's car?
Tom is the only person Mary knows here.
I have written a letter.
Work and play are words used to describe the same thing under differing conditions.
I knew all about that.
You're a fraud.
Someone will do it.
I don't think Tom knows why Mary quit her job.
The doctor persuaded him to give up smoking.
I wanted to do that before 2:30.
Tom is wide awake.
You are a genius.
I'll tell you about it someday.
The wooden chair is expensive.
I'm not asking about that.
This is a waterproof watch.
Could you please tell me how tall you are and how much you weigh?
I'm going to tell Tom tomorrow.
I think it's a good investment.
My pulse is slow.
You wouldn't believe it.
The flowers smell good.
He explained it to me.
He is a very agreeable person.
It looks like your luggage is on the next flight.
May I sit down?
Please shut up.
I felt left out.
I often eat hot dogs.
Call me at this number.
I appeared on television once.
I'm not even going to try talk Tom into doing that.
Tom is going to go with you.
Tom said that he was upset.
The idea never came into my head.
Where's your horse?
I have my own bedroom at home.
Tom didn't want to help and Mary couldn't persuade him to.
Don't give him any ideas.
I assume that you're talking about Tom.
"Wherever you go, you'll be welcomed."
Tom died suddenly.
Humans originated in Africa.
We found what we were looking for.
I want to stay here a few days.
Nobody thinks you're a coward.
Let's go up on deck.
What does Tom have?
I don't think Tom and Mary know each other.
She knows herself well.
I think Mary is too young to have her ears pierced.
It was all a mistake.
I knew how you'd react.
Is that your idea?
How much time did it take to do that?
I like cooking.
I usually don't wear a watch.
I bought this for my brother.
What inspires you most?
Let's hope we don't have to do this again.
Tom asked me what the matter was.
Is that what you were talking about last night?
It has been raining since Sunday.
Tom wanted Mary to play chess with him.
You never told me you were married.
Tell Tom I can't marry him.
Tom called from Boston.
Would you like to hear something interesting?
Is eating cockroaches a bad idea?
I didn't really care.
How do you know that?
I refuse to accept it.
I can't remember her name.
The temperature went down three degrees.
I like your hat. Where did you get it?
Where were we?
Tom washes his car every morning.
The burglar came in through a window.
I bring my children to the park almost every day.
I can do everything myself.
I have a dog and a cat.
How long can we wait?
I turned my steering wheel to the right.
Tom helped Mary find her daughter.
We walked about three hours.
What are we drinking to?
Tom's face showed his relief.
Tom quietly entered the baby's room.
I'll help Tom do that after supper.
Please get me my coat.
You don't need to apologize to Tom.
Who's right?
Casualties were inevitable.
You never get a second chance to make a first impression.
She takes her dog to the park before breakfast.
Will we arrive on time?
Don't think I won't do that.
It is quite a hard thing to bring up a child.
Why didn't you tell me about that?
Tom burst into tears.
Tom took Mary's place.
It's far from here.
You were right and I was wrong.
Tom knows what's really going on.
Put the words in alphabetical order.
He told me to wash my face.
Tom says I'm not dependable.
I am drawing a bird.
You're repeating yourself.
Tom took some pictures.
I didn't know anything about it.
Tom coughed all night.
Speak louder so everyone can hear you.
"Change your mind, if you want to."
Tom told Mary his age.
How did you enjoy the play?
Don't drink too much champagne.
I didn't feel anything.
Tom's greedy.
Tom was in a good mood.
"Tom is way taller than me, isn't he?"
I eat because I'm hungry.
I've never even seen a koala before.
Your watch gains time.
Let's talk about your trip to Boston.
Tom was wearing nothing but his underwear.
It's pretty light.
What's wrong with the way I did that?
You don't necessarily have to go there.
Do you think Tom's telling the truth?
I haven't seen him lately.
I promise that I'll protect you.
What did you make of that?
Come and stay with us in Boston.
Did you hide it somewhere?
Let me help you find it.
Be proud of yourself.
It'll be our little secret.
I left in kind of a hurry.
I'll fix it now.
He returned to the army camp.
Tom was covered in bruises.
My room is very small.
I walked to the door and opened it.
I don't know why it's happening.
Tom bought a bunch of inexpensive cameras to give to children who lived in his neighborhood.
Tom went the wrong way.
"Suddenly, all the lights went out."
Ignore Tom.
Arithmetic deals with numbers.
I've never had problems like this before.
Don't tell my mother.
You need to do that as soon as possible.
Tom is at Mary's.
What's on TV?
Aren't you going to tell Tom?
Tom is working on his science project.
A fox was caught in the snare.
I'll get there before you.
We're buying movie tickets.
Did you buy it on the black market?
How did they find us?
Don't trust anyone over twenty.
Don't be late for school tomorrow.
I don't want to be your wife anymore.
You look like a kid.
That's him at the window.
That's not always the case.
Did you lock the doors?
Tom says he's climbed this mountain three times.
Why did you park here?
You're perfect the way you are.
I'll support you as long as I live.
That's what Tom told me.
I don't think that'll be necessary.
I just wanted to play baseball.
I don't think that I can do that now.
Tom is the only one in our family who likes dogs.
Tom got tired of working with Mary and quit.
She shot him.
I have an older brother who's the same age as you.
We shook hands and said goodbye.
I don't know if you remember Tom.
"I was planning on going to the beach today, but then it started to rain."
I'll tell Tom you're looking for him.
I told Tom I wouldn't do what he asked me to do.
It's just your imagination.
Tom is the man who helped Mary.
The prosperity of a country depends upon its citizens.
I know a lot about Tom.
He swam across the river.
Tom can't be relied on.
Did Tom really do that?
It was only a hypothesis.
"I didn't use to like wine, but now I'm quite fond of it."
Bear his advice in mind.
He is influential.
"Do as I say, and no one will get hurt."
I usually went to the movies on Sunday.
I think Tom knows why I'm here.
Who's to blame for the accident?
I know that Tom is a lot busier than I am.
Are you leaving today?
Why didn't someone help Tom?
I think Tom doesn't know how to play this game.
Do you wear glasses?
Can I call you Tom?
Tom closed his locker.
Is there something I can do to help you?
I did it on purpose.
You're the only one who can protect them.
I got the same advice as you did.
Wriggle your toes.
"Didn't you know Tom had to get a visa, too?"
Who are those people over there?
Does Tom study after dinner?
They accused her of taking the money.
That was one of the biggest mistakes in my life.
How long have they been gone?
We know why you did that.
It's not just a pen.
What time did you wake up this morning?
We lock the doors at night.
She put salt into her coffee by mistake.
Tom can fix anything.
When did Tom start dating Mary?
You look a bit tired.
Has Tom left already?
Don't run here.
There were ten eggs in all.
I don't think that the post office is open yet.
Tom promised himself he'd never do that again.
I need to sleep a little.
Do you want to talk about this?
Tom doesn't need your help.
Women age faster than men.
I'm definitely against that.
You can't imagine how tired I am.
Tom wants something else.
Who were you there with?
Tom didn't want to help Mary.
I just want you to know I regret doing that.
I'll love you for the rest of my days.
I cut my finger peeling potatoes.
Let us know if you're available next week.
Nobody's seen Tom.
Stop beating around the bush and get to the point.
Was it you who broke the window?
It's dark.
What was it Tom wanted to do?
I do need your help.
Tom is always careful.
Tom isn't wearing shoes.
You should've stayed in the hospital.
She has a perfect body.
Does he know how she feels about him?
His English is better than mine.
I felt very awkward.
You're so predictable.
This box weighs a ton. What's inside?
Tom was clearly disappointed.
Tom hurried back to his office.
Christmas comes a few days before New Year.
I cut across the park.
You will obey us.
"Without your help, he would fail."
Tom is always right.
I will leave you alone.
Last night I threw up.
Let me tell you what I want for my birthday.
I want to show Tom around town.
The bus was filled to capacity.
We're very similar.
Tom helped us today.
Where will you be tomorrow?
I don't think that Tom would make a very good boss.
Tom and Mary danced all night long.
Tom never wears a hat.
We just want to be loved.
You're so wrong.
I felt a little hungry.
Tom refused to talk to Mary about John.
I should've called a doctor.
I don't think that Tom likes to do that.
Can we just go home?
Tom is cooking in the kitchen.
I know the girl.
He's so cute.
He entered the bank disguised as a guard.
"Tom gave Mary a box of chocolates, and then ate all the chocolates himself."
Whether you're able to speak French or not is completely irrelevant to this conversation.
Tom didn't seem to be in any hurry.
Tom believes we can win.
Tom phoned to say he'll be late.
I don't know whether to leave or stay.
Let me out.
I just want you to know I regret it.
I don't believe any of it.
I'll hurry.
I knew you were going to do this.
Tom was really sad.
Have you fed the dog yet?
I shouldn't have done that without you.
I know what you're going to ask.
Why don't you ask Tom yourself?
You need to sober up.
Tom is too tired to eat now.
I know that you can hear me.
I like sleeping.
They crashed.
Don't worry. I can fix it.
Tom is ironing shirts.
Tom was injured in the fall.
Tom asked everyone to take off their shoes.
Three times four is twelve.
Tom has never been in love.
Tom is rude and selfish.
Tom closed the door of his bedroom.
Tom and Mary are both here.
I knew that would interest you.
Allow us to do our job.
I ran for a mile.
He often laughs at his own jokes.
It's been ten years since he came to Japan.
You'll thank me.
Tom followed.
We've forgiven you.
Let's go into the garden.
See you in Boston.
Do you have a lawyer?
What's Tom running from?
Don't play with your food.
Don't come into my room.
Tom has friends in Boston.
I've never told anyone this before.
He's a ninja.
This is so exciting.
What happened to your leg?
Could we have a table near the window?
I deal with people like that all the time.
Have you already eaten lunch?
He likes geography and history.
I'm sorry for the mess.
All you have to do is apologize for being late.
He does not smoke.
I used to be tired all the time.
Black suits you.
I improvised.
Come on.
She decided to quit her job.
Please just listen.
Tom got a decent grade on the test he took last week.
I exchanged places with Tom.
Who stole my keys?
I saw Tom swim across the river.
Can I come with you?
He made it clear that he had nothing to do with the matter.
Tom forgot to turn off the gas.
Who does this belong to?
Tom wears a kilt when he plays the bagpipes.
Do you know that for sure?
I burned myself on the stove.
You have a funny laugh.
I'm almost done. Just give me a minute.
Tom is a sculptor.
Tom has a really good voice.
People like gossiping.
Tom never told me that he had a dog.
I don't know how to reply to that question.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
I am interested in this book.
Almost no one believed her.
Are my clothes dry yet?
You can't live like that anymore.
I heard Tom talking to someone in French.
Why are they leaving?
Tom told me that he was very hungry.
Tom was well prepared for the exam.
What were you just thinking?
You shouldn't eat that.
You are rich.
Young people must respect the law.
Why did you tell Tom?
I made you lunch.
How much is this pen?
I plowed the field.
Please bring a dictionary.
Should I reply to his letter?
You'll never guess what I found.
Tom lives in the lap of luxury.
Tom explained the problem to me.
I got married when I was 19 years old.
What's your dog's name?
I was in Australia last year.
What would you do without me?
The situation is different today.
You won't have that problem.
When are you going to tell Tom?
I'm the black sheep of the family.
Tom thought otherwise.
She looked around.
Why are many bars closed on Mondays?
Tom probably needs to work next weekend.
What do you remember?
Sit down.
I didn't go and neither did Tom.
I wonder what it is.
We need to find out what Tom wants.
He let me use his typewriter.
I heard a woman scream.
Tom didn't want to come.
I told Tom to go there.
Why did you start doing that?
Who does it belong to?
This tastes like tea.
That was too easy.
You didn't need to come so early.
No one in my family is a musician.
You look afraid.
Do you have any homework to do?
I'll be patient.
"I want to find a blonde, blue-eyed European woman."
What'll Tom do?
Can you please pour me some more wine?
There was a great deal of conjecture as to what would happen.
I hate you with all of my heart.
I can't do it anymore.
They believe in a life after death.
Tom isn't married anymore.
We're both teachers.
Are you still free tomorrow evening?
I didn't study math at all.
Will you support me?
I hate reptiles.
You should rest.
Who did you talk to?
Tom understands what Mary wants him to do.
I don't think Tom is ready yet.
Tom lives in an apartment not far from my place.
This car is older than I am.
It is one thing to make a plan and quite another to carry it out.
Children are dying.
You should have your car washed.
I'd stop doing that if you asked me to.
I never drove a car until I was thirty.
Does Tom live here?
He abandoned all hope.
Do you know Tom Jackson?
I'm giving up smoking.
Tom is much taller than you.
I saw Tom tonight.
I don't even know where.
Tom can come again if he wants to.
How many hours a week do you work?
"If for some reason I'm late, please don't wait for me."
How much did our trip cost us?
Are you sure you have to be at the meeting?
I think you've got the flu.
Tom broke his nose.
I have one.
Twist that knob to the right and the box will open.
Tom sang better tonight than he usually does.
Tom tied his shoe laces.
Tell Tom when to come.
Tom must've changed it.
I'm pretty sure no one's talking about us.
Tom has changed his name.
Fill this out.
When can we leave?
I need a leather briefcase.
I'm at your service.
I have a small gift for you.
It is our turn to laugh.
Thank you for all you've done for us.
Do you know what they found out?
This is a horrible tragedy.
Last month we went to Manila.
I went there.
We had to call off the baseball game because of the rain.
Remember these rules.
Why are you always so serious?
Lady Gaga gave $1 million to the Red Cross to help the victims of Hurricane Sandy.
Tom pretended he didn't know me.
He is hard to please.
What might that be?
Tom says that he didn't study at all for the test.
I'm not going to take it anymore.
Where should we go?
I eat meat.
I've already thanked Tom for doing that.
The baby is growing up.
You look like you're sad.
I'm a French teacher.
I'm not planning on doing that until Tom asks me to.
Look into my eyes.
Tom is going on a picnic tomorrow with Mary.
I want you to give Tom a message.
Did you tell Tom what to buy?
Tom hates running.
Can I begin?
I wonder why Tom didn't tell you.
Tom cleaned the fish.
I always buy fresh vegetables instead of frozen ones.
"Honey, are you here?"
I persuaded him to go to the party.
I don't think that Tom knows where Mary parked her car.
"I'm a little busy here, Tom."
You're going to miss your flight.
I didn't know we were related.
I would like to see Tom one more time.
Go see if Tom is OK.
I had hardly reached the school when the bell rang.
Tom promised Mary that he'd be more careful in the future.
My French is not good at all.
Tom came back yesterday morning.
You may use mine if you want to.
I won't wait forever.
What're you going to do now?
We haven't been able to prove it.
Add a tiny pinch of salt.
They won't do it.
That store is closed on Mondays.
I take the blame.
That smells nice.
I don't expect you to start now.
I'm coming.
The doctor advised him not to smoke.
I can speak French a little.
I've got something to say.
I was raised in Boston.
We were in Boston together.
I suspect Tom is still in love with his ex-wife.
I don't care where Tom was.
Tom paid Mary.
It was Tom who stole Mary's bike.
Tom followed Mary.
You can always come back.
Canada is larger than Japan.
Do you have a house in Boston?
I don't think that Tom will have any problems.
Sudden decrease in appetite is sometimes a sign of illness.
Aren't you Canadian?
I hope to hire someone who can speak French.
They can't have gone far.
We just wouldn't do that.
I see someone.
Keep walking.
Tom knows many famous people.
I didn't think that you'd get it.
Do you want to know how I helped?
I don't think Tom is going to Boston.
Do you really want me to drink that?
You don't need to know that.
"Tom went fishing, but didn't catch anything."
An android is a kind of robot.
I hope that won't happen again.
Didn't you know Tom was a painter?
"He was born poor, but died a millionaire."
The meeting was almost over.
Tom was paid three hundred dollars.
Don't put that in the bag.
Go do your homework.
"Please speak a little slower, Tom."
Tom began laughing.
"Children need many things, but above all they need love."
I pulled a muscle.
I need to do that.
Tom said he hopes Mary won't be late.
Tom moved to Australia last winter.
Tom has been released.
"If I had seen Tom yesterday, I would've talked to him."
Are you really the one who did that?
The police think that Tom killed himself.
Tom has lost his key.
Nobody is listening to Tom.
Are you sure Tom did that?
Why didn't you go to school yesterday?
I pretended that I was sleeping.
Did you guys hear what Tom said on TV?
Why was Tom expelled from school?
Are they open on Sunday?
He has a blue coat on.
"It is easy to love, but difficult to be loved."
We used to work together.
Tom needs to do that more often.
Tom has some things that he has to do.
This one's for you.
Promise me you'll do that.
I want to take a shower.
The demonstrators gathered in the square.
Tom got married when he was 30 years old.
Tom has three sons. One's almost your age.
We've got to escape.
"Even if I wanted to, I couldn't help you."
You're probably right.
She has a lot of money.
I think it's going well.
I couldn't find the page I was looking for.
Are these books yours?
You're getting more and more beautiful.
We had an examination in English yesterday.
I didn't fall asleep.
I'm not saying Tom is right.
Are you Mary's husband?
He tried to hold back his anger.
Are you still afraid of the dark?
I've lost my sense of smell.
Please come home right after school.
Do you want me to call a doctor?
I never asked for it.
I saw Tom enter the room.
I'd rather go by subway than by train.
Don't worry. I'll come up with something.
I thought Tom loved me.
Tom is hardly ever at home.
Let's talk about that tonight.
"Which would you rather do, eat at home or eat out?"
My computer won't start up anymore.
I'm not bored.
I blame Tom for all of this.
"Tom was tired, so he went to bed earlier."
Tom is impatient.
I'm so hungry.
Over three hundred people lost their lives that day.
There's been a lot of rain this year.
That was just what I wanted.
Tom called 911.
Do you even know who Tom is?
The flowers don't look well. I'd like to water them. Is there a watering can?
Please don't run in the classroom.
Tom is chatting with his friends.
Where do you want to go?
Tom is badly hurt.
Tom was having trouble breathing.
I was proud of you.
I'll do it myself.
Tom didn't smile often.
I forgot Tom knew how to read French.
You're not normal.
I didn't even know that you had one.
"We can run away from everything, except from our conscience."
"Please talk to me, Tom."
"I tried to open the door, but I couldn't."
Tom used to walk to school.
We rarely eat out.
You were seventh.
You look well rested.
Tom fished through his pockets for his keys.
Monday was a cold day.
Am I talented?
I'm sure your efforts will result in success.
Tom poured two glasses of orange juice and handed one to Mary.
I think that my mom knows.
I will have read Hamlet three times if I read it again.
Go with Tom.
We were very busy.
Tom collects weapons.
I fell off my bike.
I don't want to look at Tom.
It was a bold decision.
I thought you wouldn't mind.
Don't wait for me.
I don't know where to put it.
Tom keeps saying he's innocent.
He's been waiting here for a long time.
What time did you go to bed yesterday?
Tom is selfish.
This growth ought to be removed immediately.
She stole a lot of money from him.
I didn't know that that was going to happen.
Are you going with Tom?
Why don't you stay here?
Tom has been neglecting his work lately.
I know what Tom is doing here.
You're too old.
Tom hid behind a rock.
"You've been drinking, haven't you?"
Do you have any bad habits?
He is eating.
Does anyone really believe Tom?
Tom wants to die.
I thought people were exaggerating.
Please don't let this happen again.
Tom said that he was curious.
This is true love.
What's Tom's favorite color?
No one noticed that Tom wasn't there.
Whose house is that?
Tom sat down on the bed.
Does Tom speak French well?
I don't need to read it.
I'd like to find a way to improve my memory.
Send Tom home.
Tom is very popular.
Where was Tom headed?
He lied to us.
Tell me you're not serious!
Tom took off his headphones.
Can you help me install this software?
Put on some clothes.
I saw you there.
Doing that won't be easy.
Everyone's waiting to see what's going to happen.
Can you promise me you won't do that?
What's mine's yours.
Are you free on Tuesday?
Tom isn't in jail anymore.
"I have seen ""Star Wars"" twice."
We could go kayaking next weekend.
They are both very intelligent.
When was the last time you played golf?
Tom took his jacket off.
Tom waited for the elevator.
Do you find me attractive?
These three countries were united into one.
What do you think they were doing all morning?
We have to follow their instructions.
Tom decided it was time to do that.
She cooks for him every day.
How much did these sunglasses cost?
Are you sure it was Tom?
Her house is at the foot of a mountain.
Get a job.
Let's take Tom with us.
What language is this?
I'm here to prove you wrong.
He stuck a flower in his buttonhole.
Please promise me you will never tell a lie again.
Alice will tell you that in Wonderland everything is topsy-turvy.
The view from my hotel room was beautiful.
My brother has just come home from Kobe.
You probably wouldn't even recognize Tom if you saw him now.
Tom's a smart guy.
The school is located at the foot of a hill.
I'd like to find out why it got broken.
Have you seen the headlines?
You know that I don't like Tom.
I hope that I can convince you to change your mind.
Tom cleared his throat and began to speak.
Tom says that he feels a lot better now.
Tom cut the apple in half.
I didn't know you were so unhappy.
What caused the accident?
She called off the party.
You've done so much for us.
What were they waiting for?
My head doesn't ache anymore.
Tom is kind to people.
The last bus will leave in thirty minutes.
That's the part I liked best.
I like French food very much.
Did you write your name?
I wonder why Tom said that.
I need to get out of this place.
Tom taught me many things.
Show me something new.
You shouldn't smoke so much.
I know why Tom didn't want to go to Boston with Mary.
That is mine.
Why are you holding my hands?
Did you just call me a monkey?
This is the village where I was born.
Did you let Tom kiss you?
Not all birds can fly.
Tom promised that it wouldn't happen again.
I'll give you a call tomorrow.
Tom's repulsive.
I know who got arrested.
Do you think this is easy for me?
Tom is always in a good mood.
I promised to help.
What was your father's name?
I want you home now.
They were satisfied with the result.
Watch your feet.
I haven't been outside in weeks.
I lost sight of my friends.
Your jokes aren't funny.
We don't have to go right now.
I'm hoping to win.
"Is he speaking English, French, or German?"
I started reading.
The alarm didn't wake Tom.
You're so weird.
Are you happy with your life?
Tom bit his lip.
"If you want to talk, talk."
Tom will be a doctor.
Where did you get these pictures?
My sister has a piano.
The waitress flirted with Tom thinking that he'd leave her a larger tip.
I've changed my website's layout.
Catch the ball.
The fly is on the ceiling.
I wanted to let Tom go.
Tom didn't win.
Just tell the truth.
Tom doesn't usually wear pajamas.
Why are you trying to scare me?
I think everybody should try to calm down.
Tom fell through the ice into the icy water.
That's why I left.
I thought you loved reading.
Tom likes singing in the shower.
She lived with him all her life.
I'm sure you'll have a good time.
Let's wait till he comes back.
Tom said he was jealous.
I thought I told you never to go there alone.
I have no objection to your plan.
I still have a lot of things to do.
You never told me you were a rabbi.
They live in a very beautiful house.
Tom turned on the desk lamp and started working.
Tom said he didn't mean to hurt you.
You're lying again.
Tom has braces on his teeth.
Even a child can do it.
I think we shouldn't have gotten married.
Tom was here a few weeks ago.
"I have to lose weight, so I'm on a diet."
Why are you burning these pictures?
I told Tom not to come today.
Tom will explain everything to you later.
"I can sing, too."
What kind of car do you drive?
He's a patient man.
Tom didn't want to leave his dog with me.
What do you think it was for?
The reason why he should resign his job is that he is not equal to it.
Is this your first visit to Japan?
I left my umbrella on the train.
You should acquaint yourself with the local customs.
Do you need to do that?
I'm glad Tom waited.
This is the best time to fertilize the fields.
It's too loud.
"If for some reason I'm late, please don't wait for me."
Many of the people died.
I pricked my thumb with a needle.
Please get out of here.
Tom doesn't know why Mary is here.
Tom isn't my son.
She is a twin.
Finish the job.
I want to know whether what I'm doing is right.
I thought you'd be busy.
Tom was gone for three months.
Everyone was hurt.
Can you elaborate on this a little more?
They wash their hands.
This is what I'm good at.
The police haven't notified Tom yet.
This should be illegal.
I miss my elementary school teachers.
Terrorists blew up a bus.
Tom and Mary are in love.
Are we in the minority?
They can't hear you.
I think I love you.
You're going to have to go alone.
A mortgage is a kind of loan that people can use to buy a house.
Tom doesn't want this.
I volunteered.
We all hope Tom doesn't get lost.
You didn't keep your word.
I can't show you this.
I'm a poet.
I think that I know your brother.
He can do it better than I can.
Do you have more work than usual today?
We've been here too long.
"I have seen ""Star Wars"" twice."
I have to speak to Tom in French. It's the only language he knows.
Tom was lucky.
Who did you ask?
Did Tom do something wrong?
I thought it'd be worth it.
You need to eat less and exercise more.
He won the lottery.
He asked for my pardon.
Tom is in big trouble.
I've promised to go to Boston with Tom.
I heard a noise upstairs.
Tom is there alone.
Women use talking to maintain personal relationships.
Stay with Tom for a moment.
"You missed them, didn't you?"
They're adorable.
Tom doesn't know how to reply.
What are you going to do now?
Tom said the team needed a new captain.
The prisoner asked to be released early.
I didn't know whether I'd be permitted to do that or not.
Let me check.
She is a sophomore.
Tom isn't likely to agree with us.
I can't tell whether it's raining or not.
I didn't know that you were so old.
The story was so complicated that I couldn't follow it.
I heard a knock on the door and it was Tom.
I'll probably win.
Tom was captured.
How many kilograms do you want to lose?
"Excuse me, may I say something?"
Stay close to Tom.
The baby cried.
Where did Tom get this coat?
You should find a job.
There is evidence to the contrary.
Tom won't call Mary.
I'm a little tired today.
Can you read it?
I won't do what you're asking me to do.
You had better go at once.
We've always been good friends.
I thought Tom told you about me.
Tom is the only one who got hurt.
Take off your tie.
Tom doesn't come here every day.
Was I wrong?
You can see many animals in this forest.
Can you spare a few minutes?
I can't believe Tom killed Mary.
I'm the one who helped Tom with his homework.
Tom couldn't stop sneezing.
She speaks Portuguese.
Are you sure this is the right place?
Please tell me more about yourself.
We're good friends.
Tom ate nothing.
I'm shy.
"I did that yesterday, so I wouldn't have to do it tomorrow."
Tom lost his voice.
My heart is broken.
I'll tell Tom that you're with me.
He gave me some money.
Tom misses Australia.
Why did you poison us?
Get out of here or I'll call the police.
Tom's the best.
Read the kind of books that teach you something.
I went into Tom's room.
How old do you think she is?
Tom was thoroughly depressed.
I didn't expect to see you again.
He has a strong personality.
I don't think Tom knows that we're here.
Drive cautiously.
It's a risky plan.
May I use your lawnmower?
Tom made Mary wait.
I'll be in my car.
Tell me how to do this.
I've already paid the bill.
He isn't answering his phone.
I wish I knew the answer to this question.
I have been writing letters all morning.
You should've woken me up.
Tom doesn't play rugby.
He's proud of never being late to school.
I would like to know as well.
I suspect that you've already done that.
I hope I win.
Take notes.
Are you about to fire me?
Tom wants me to do it.
Luckily nobody died.
"They say housework won't kill you, but why take the risk?"
Do you want to drink anything?
Who's upstairs now?
I felt dazed when I got up.
Try to find it.
You don't want that.
Tom said that Mary was beautiful.
"The world turns around sex, money and drugs."
I haven't ever lied to you.
We'll be there.
Somebody's knocking at the door.
You're very boring.
Wait for us here.
Where do you usually buy your shoes?
Do you know where Tom's car is parked?
How dare you tell me what I should or shouldn't do!
How often are you in town?
Bring a couple more chairs.
He quickly went out of the room.
This is more expensive than I expected.
I baked two pies this afternoon.
When did you learn to make pizza?
It's unlikely that replacing the battery will fix the problem.
I saw Tom try to kiss you.
Tom's girlfriend's name is Mary.
You're a good artist.
I've done all this for you.
I have to buy a new carpet for this room.
Do you have any plans for tomorrow?
"Of course, I'll help."
You were guilty.
Tell me again where you live.
This text is aimed at beginners.
That's hard to do.
I see Tom almost every day.
Can you swear in French?
You should join us.
Which ones do you like better?
Tom is leaving now.
Tom is going to have to live with what he did.
Tom told Mary that he had a new job.
I'll tell Tom what I know.
Which one do you like?
Please help if you can.
Did you lose something?
Could you call a doctor?
She will come back before long.
"Right now, it is a half past ten."
I told Tom I was there.
The refrigerator door is open.
Don't go there.
The phone doesn't work right now.
Tell Tom.
I just want to have fun.
Did you buy a round trip ticket?
He is second to none when it comes to debating.
Tell her that I am taking a shower.
Get everything.
Tom is not an idle boy any longer.
You're always finding fault with me.
Does your stomach hurt?
I never understood why Tom liked Mary so much.
This is our only weapon.
Tom and Mary excused themselves and went outside.
We've had a lot of rain recently.
Tom has a very long beard.
Please talk to me.
Tom blamed everything on Mary.
I thought Tom was your best friend.
Tom had a bruise under one eye.
I can't remember exactly what Tom was wearing.
Who else is on your list?
Don't you feel happy and relaxed?
He's a skilled linguist.
Stopgap measures won't make a dent in drug addiction.
He slipped while crossing the street.
Neither Tom nor Mary has ever been to Boston.
Tom missed his wife Mary.
Let's sing that song again.
This pen is very easy to write with.
I have no idea what's going on.
Tom sent me a note.
I thought you wanted a divorce.
Do you spend more time with your friends or with your family?
Maybe Tom made Mary do that.
I can't eat pork.
Tom said that he was married.
Let's all be friends.
It looks like you've lost a few pounds.
I was too scared to do anything.
He had to go there.
I think you should listen to Tom.
I don't like cold weather.
Tom thought that you could do that.
Tom wants to tell you about Mary.
Footprints were left on the floor.
Tom is reading a book about the history of Australia.
I never knew that Tom was so rich.
I'm thinking of going to Boston.
Give me a moment.
I'm committed.
Have you ever seen such a nice film?
Tom was elected.
I told you to stay away from Tom.
I don't want to hear this.
I'd like for Tom to tell you where he was two nights ago.
He studied art in Germany.
Tom knew I wouldn't win.
I get off at the next station.
I was the one who suggested it.
Bring your sister next time.
Now I'm in trouble.
It's only a dream.
Come back here.
We cannot tell a good person from a bad one by looks alone.
Tom is getting married on Monday.
He's afraid of the dog.
The tower collapsed.
I know that you're smart.
What time will you leave?
There's nothing left to talk about.
Tom carried everything he owned in a small suitcase.
Take precautions.
That would be even better.
"If I did that, Tom would be upset."
I don't think you heard what I said.
They finished building the bridge on time.
It's a mammal.
Who were you speaking to on the phone?
I don't think that Tom is coming.
You shouldn't take anything for granted.
I'm very sleepy.
Have you been abroad?
I fall asleep in the class every now and then.
Thank you for the wonderful meal.
Don't spend more than you earn.
Are you sure that you want to quit your job?
Tom got in the cab.
I'll pay for dinner.
"Tom saw two men lying on the floor, bleeding from gunshot wounds."
The problem is worse.
Do you mind my turning on the radio?
We went to the beach.
Did anyone force you to do that?
Tom knows what you did.
Do you agree with that?
"Well, you've convinced me."
What Tom said was a lie.
I paid the bill.
Here's a picture of you.
Tom didn't buy any eggs.
They need our help.
This invention marked the dawn of a new era in weaving.
I've already told Tom that Mary is in the hospital.
I do that for the money.
What's Tom's sister's name?
He leaves a widow and a daughter.
You don't know what it's like.
He crossed the Pacific Ocean in thirty days.
I believe you're wrong.
It was not an accident.
We've both read the note.
Do you want to wait in the bar?
Tom doesn't know why Mary did that.
"I thought that Tom would apologize to me, but he didn't."
I wish Tom could stay longer.
Tom jumped at the offer.
How would you like your steak cooked?
He wore a mask so no one would recognize him.
Tom said that he was really unlucky.
Tom is probably going to be OK.
Let's discuss that problem tomorrow.
I know you're smart.
Put it back where you found it.
Tom is happy when he is with Mary.
I suggest that you do it right away.
I'm surprised at myself.
That will do.
Tom explained to Mary in detail how to do that.
I've got kids.
Tom is a terrible cook.
Are you ready to go out?
"We've considered your proposal, and we've decided that we aren't able to reduce the price."
I want to find out what kind of music Tom likes.
How can I stop Tom?
Can you hear?
Did you put my name on the list?
The little girl stuck out her tongue at him.
It'll rain tomorrow.
Don't forget to call me.
"On hearing the news, everybody became quiet."
He served a ten-year prison term.
Tom wasn't seriously injured.
"Hey, what are you doing here?"
He is twice as old as she is.
Someone hit me on the back.
What's the name of the person who recommended us to you?
Can you give me your cell number?
I'd die without you.
We were afraid.
I shut the car door.
I just ate.
I live in Kyoto now.
I have a younger sister who lives in Boston.
He is a good singer.
Tom didn't let Mary do that.
I wish I hadn't kissed Tom.
I met a girl.
Tell Tom I'd like to talk to him.
That name sounds familiar.
When were you there?
I can't swim any further.
Tom promised Mary he wouldn't tell John.
I do have a theory.
Don't forget your bag.
I wonder if Tom was surprised.
Tom's out of the picture.
This report is well written.
You may stay here with me.
I know you said that.
All that has changed now.
Hold the handrail.
I think we should go now.
What's that for?
Tom is about the same age as me.
I've had a wonderful time in Australia.
Why are you wearing that hat?
I refused to leave.
I want Tom's money.
Tom didn't know Mary would be there.
You will soon get accustomed to your new school.
Did you ask Tom why he did this?
I don't do much.
I'm not always so lenient.
Have you already finished your homework?
I decided to tell her that I love her.
Did you kiss Tom goodbye?
I don't worry about it.
Tom wants to work with Mary.
I'll explain it in detail next week.
You suggested it yourself.
I really thought Tom liked me.
Tom will have to talk to Mary.
I thought it was Monday today.
Don't make fun of her. She just chugged three bottles of beer.
I hope you're not mad at me.
I speak French much better than anyone else in my family.
I remember my childhood well.
Help me lift this.
Tom didn't think Mary was busy.
I couldn't do it.
I like tennis better than I like soccer.
Can you find out if Tom speaks French?
Anything will do.
Don't ever ask me to do that again.
I wanted to give you a chance.
I was drunk.
I had a nice chat with Tom.
I'm defenseless.
Don't ask me that.
I'm not scared of terrorists.
Maybe Tom missed his bus.
Step aside.
I think about Tom a lot.
Do you know what this means?
He speaks too fast.
Will you give me another glass of milk?
I wouldn't want to live with Tom.
Tom thinks Mary is busy.
You'll be safe there.
I still hate Tom.
Tom might be a traitor.
Do you live in Portugal or Brazil?
Have both of you already had lunch?
Tom fell out of a tree.
I took Tom to the hospital.
Do you think Tom might win?
I don't think I'll be cold.
I aim to be a doctor when I grow up.
This really helped.
I go to a restaurant once in a blue moon.
Tom doesn't usually eat breakfast.
"I had to wait for a long time for Tom's answer, but it was worth it."
Tom told Mary he was hot.
I smell something rotten.
Don't be ridiculous.
There's no sign of infection.
Mary was a waitress.
I'm looking forward to the return of spring.
I also have a motorcycle.
She is saving money to go abroad.
We didn't see many deer in the forest.
She doesn't have any brothers or sisters.
Tom was shot to death.
That will be better for you.
Cats are natural-born hunters.
What happened doesn't change anything.
Take away this box.
Look at this large map of America.
Tom may have seen it.
We already tried that.
Tom opened the door and was surprised to see Mary.
Let's keep in touch by e-mail.
I can do it all myself.
Tom's cruel.
I know it's true.
How long will it be?
I don't feel comfortable with that.
I have a feeling you'll be a very good lawyer.
I feel homesick.
How are we better than any of them?
Make sure to turn off all the lights before going out.
We don't want to go to Boston.
I know what happened to Tom.
I have short hair.
Do you work for Tom?
The blast destroyed everything.
Throw it away.
Tom left this for you.
We have a lot of earthquakes in Japan.
I'm not doing this anymore.
Can you stay till Monday?
The two statements don't agree.
Give me thirty minutes.
This was a gift from Tom.
Tom said he'd win.
Who's that fellow over there?
They should pay me for doing this.
I borrowed it.
Where are your daughters?
Everyone but Tom has already gone home.
"He who reads often and walks often, sees much and knows much."
Short skirts have already gone out of fashion.
I know you don't want to talk to me.
I called the police.
Do you really think Tom is better than me?
She never found out the truth.
Tom is a pig!
It's my birthday.
I like spending time with you.
Why does Tom lie so much?
I'm 18 years old.
"Without you, I'm nothing."
Tom said you wanted to go to Australia with us.
Tom told Mary to mow the lawn.
We know you're in here.
Tom hugged his teddy bear.
"Tom got first prize, didn't he?"
"Hi everyone, I'm Tom."
How much is this camera?
You may ask me any question you want.
I painted my car.
We tried to warn Tom.
Tom hit his head on the roof of the car.
I want a word with you.
We're doing what we love to do.
I'm not studying.
Tom will sit with Mary.
Can I keep you company?
You'll get lost.
Your message has been received.
Have you ever eaten whale meat?
I couldn't help laughing.
The old doctor gave individual attention to each patient.
I would like to read some books about Lincoln.
Why don't you stay a little while?
Did I make the team?
This place is crawling with ants.
Tom walked Mary to the bus station.
Tom is wearing a blue sweater today.
It's hard for Tom to talk about that.
You lost.
I don't complain often.
I don't have an alibi.
Tom told me he was planning to go to Boston in October.
Everybody hates this idea.
Do you have a son?
Don't give it to anyone.
Tom instantly recognized Mary's voice.
Tom wanted to go live with his dad.
Tom doesn't look frightened.
I feel guilty about having told a lie.
Bring the key.
Maybe we'll play some basketball.
When did Tom meet Mary?
Sunflowers are beautiful flowers.
They're always fighting among themselves.
"Tom is already here, but Mary isn't here yet."
Turn down the music.
I started the engine.
Please give me the letter.
"May I call you tonight? ""Sure."""
I'm giving you one more chance.
Tom will wait for you.
I was unconscious.
That's what I want to know.
My neighbors are my friends.
"If I were you, I wouldn't do it."
Tom won't let you go.
I have a passport.
Is health care free in Germany?
Perhaps Tom will leave.
Don't make me laugh.
Tom has started ignoring me.
She's not as shy as she used to be.
How in the world did you know that?
I wasn't raised that way.
Who doesn't know such a simple proverb?
Let me know as soon as he comes.
Who'll start?
We thought you had decided to stay.
Tom isn't all that honest.
I didn't like this game until I started winning.
I wonder how that works.
You'll find out.
Parents must provide their children with proper food and clothing.
"Tom is three years older than you, isn't he?"
I'd like to buy a wooden spoon.
It is not manly to speak ill of others behind their backs.
Take off your shoes.
Tom gave Mary a potted plant.
Try not to worry too much.
It's rather curious.
You saved us all.
Can you help me set the table?
You should have kept it secret.
"Has anybody called the police? ""I have."""
Tom still hasn't found a good job.
Tom made his position clear.
I didn't know your grandchildren lived in Boston.
I'm at a friend's house.
They had a boat.
We found the stolen bag in this bush.
Tom dropped it.
Tom asked me not to laugh.
When are we going to eat?
Tom is not my son.
I don't think I deserved it.
You have to stay here.
She's not admitting her mistake.
I didn't even know that you had a horse.
What kind of movies do you like to watch?
Does a child's musical talent depend on heredity?
Sunshine is the main source of vitamin D.
Language and culture can't be separated.
I baked it for you.
May I borrow an umbrella?
Did Tom tell Mary what she should do?
Do you know who Tom's father is?
I told Tom to ignore it.
We saw a castle ahead of us.
"If I knew anything, I'd tell you."
Did you forget to sign your name again?
Tom said he knows Mary's brother.
We'll decide later.
Have you read my report?
What's wrong with these?
You can't believe everything you hear.
I don't know your name yet.
Everyone knows you did that.
Tom said he wanted to win.
Stop that!
Mary is really gorgeous.
I'd be happy if you'd come.
"You'd better take your umbrella, just in case it rains."
I don't feel sorry for you.
Tom and Mary are smiling at each other.
Hot dogs are three dollars.
Did Tom give you something?
I'm not racist.
Tom says he's not busy.
You may not like what you hear.
Where's my lunch?
Tom is going to wait for us.
What am I missing here?
She is thirty-one.
What I'm going to do is study French.
I heard you laughing.
Did you catch the train?!
Tom moved to a smaller house.
It's too difficult for me.
I've been studying French.
He's not a liar.
I cannot afford to buy a car.
You'll never guess.
I'm furious.
Tom thought that you were in Boston.
You know I don't have any money.
Tom doesn't want Mary to go anywhere without him.
Think about it.
Have I told you this before?
I am a stranger here.
Do you want some grapes?
Do you think Tom is still unconscious?
Do you know Tom's girlfriend's name?
Tom guessed that Mary was around thirty years old.
We've decided not to buy that house.
I was deeply impressed with his courage.
Look at this picture again.
Tom weighs more than Mary does.
I'm a morning person.
Do you understand what I mean?
Why should I get a dog?
Are we sinking?
Don't disappoint him.
Please don't stop.
We need some more time.
The difference between Earth and the other planets is that Earth has water.
What time did you get up this morning?
Tom admitted he was married.
I wasn't working here at that time.
I have no further questions.
Set Tom free.
That's an interesting thought.
Everything is cheap.
Tom has lived alone since his wife died.
You're screaming.
I wasn't so lucky.
I got rid of it.
Turn left here.
Tom objected to that.
I am no longer tired.
I was not disappointed.
He was accused of stealing dinosaur bones.
Where will Tom go?
Tom said it was your fault.
I don't think that Tom and Mary are married.
How many flowers did you buy?
Do you often go on business trips?
I'm pretty sure I can find a job.
They're enemies.
Everything depends upon the results.
What's it going to be like?
He is a very modest man.
"If you didn't want to go, you should've told me."
What do you have in that box?
She always turns a deaf ear to my advice.
Why do people do this?
I don't have anything to tell you.
Thank you for the flowers.
Tom shut his notebook.
How was your summer vacation?
I'm a teacher here.
I heard a gunshot.
Is Tom protecting someone?
Valentine's Day is celebrated in February.
Tom was alone in the dark.
Tom forgot his umbrella on the bus.
Why do humans smile? This is a very difficult question to answer.
I have plenty of friends.
Tom is unable to read.
We're very angry.
When will you go back to Boston?
Tom's apartment is small.
Was Tom the one who told you to do that?
How do you know that that isn't true?
Tom is probably thirsty.
I'll be absent for a week.
Are you sure you can't help us?
Everybody ignored it.
I think friends are important.
She unbuttoned her shirt.
Hoover was well-known to Americans.
It hadn't crossed my mind.
Don't leave until you've done that.
"In case of a fire, use the stairs."
Tom should've told Mary that he was married.
How bad is Tom hurt?
We know that's not true.
It rained this afternoon.
Animals act on instinct.
I'm taking away your phone.
I was forced to do it.
They despise you.
I'm studying French now.
What makes you think that way?
"Actually, I don't like coffee."
They say that the Vikings discovered America before Columbus.
Tom has enough money to buy anything he wants.
I hope Tom knows.
I want a new kitchen.
I was somewhere else.
Don't expect Tom to do that.
Did Tom really tell you that?
I wasn't conscious of anyone watching me.
Tom told Mary how it happened.
Tom decided to do that.
Do you always win?
We've heard that before.
You should pay back your debts.
They wouldn't believe me.
You've succeeded where others have failed.
We're not sure where Tom is.
Tom didn't return my calls.
"That surprised me, too."
I want you all out of here.
I read one or two books every week.
Tom showed Mary the poem he had written.
I have to shower.
He wasn't ready for it.
I'm definitely not coming.
It's riskier than it looks.
I think Tom eats too much meat.
Please stay.
I brought you some coffee.
You must've had a nice day.
Where's Tom's family now?
Tom told me he needed more money.
I can't belive you called Tom an idiot.
It's best not to ask.
That's not what's bothering me.
I knew your father.
He's the most valuable player on our team.
How many times have you swum across this river?
Tom reads faster than I do.
"It won't be our problem, will it?"
Her son is sure to succeed.
Tom and Mary just bought a new car.
Are you sure you don't want to go?
"Tom is strong, isn't he?"
They're enjoying themselves.
I think you need my help.
You shouldn't have said that.
That doesn't concern us.
I was in bed when you phoned.
This game is really boring.
I get paid to do that.
I think it'll rain this afternoon.
I'm tired of listening to your complaints.
I wanted to help you.
I didn't know you were coming.
There are many Americans who can speak Japanese.
Do you think Tom was cold?
You never told me you were married.
I'm planning to stay in Boston for three months.
Tom didn't want the same thing to happen to him.
"Tom has left, but Mary is still here."
I made a wrong turn.
Call me at my office.
The car was stolen.
Tom isn't the one who told Mary where John lived.
I prepared breakfast for Tom.
Tom changed the channel.
Tom used to spend a lot of time with his grandmother.
Tom didn't answer the phone.
Do you have any pictures of Tom when he was a kid?
I'm going to miss your cooking.
I had to go home and change clothes.
Do as he tells you.
I don't want Tom to know that I got married.
Tom told me he forgot something.
I like walking alone.
Did you change the filter?
"I could do that, but I don't want to."
I don't know anything about this matter.
"You don't believe Tom, do you?"
Yours was better than mine.
Don't laugh at him.
The Ariake Sea is one of the biggest tidelands in Japan.
Tom doesn't have a good French-English dictionary.
Tom likes her.
I gave him all the money I had.
That felt like an earthquake.
Look here.
Tom refused to do what he was told to do.
Tom hates rules.
Why do you think Tom would do this?
I don't always get up early.
Are you free this weekend?
I don't like dogs.
Tom thought Mary wouldn't have to do that.
There were no schools for the deaf at that time.
Tom comes here three or four times a month.
Tom needs to lose a few pounds.
We're not sure on how it started.
We caught a lot of fish today.
I'm sorry for calling so late.
Finish the story.
Tom started typing.
Tom gave no additional details.
Where did Tom get his money?
Tom doesn't want to go to the lake with us.
It's only three o'clock.
Why aren't you working?
I think I've made the right choice.
We suspect him of telling a lie.
Leave if you wish.
Do you want me to talk to Tom about that?
Tom is just trying to help.
That tie goes well with your shirt.
I'm super hungry.
I was drunk.
I can't tell you why.
Why haven't you called?
You two always got along.
I hope everyone agrees.
Which beach do you like to go to?
"Work slowly, and you won't make mistakes."
You don't have to thank me.
Do you remember anything else?
You can sit with me.
I just want them both to be happy.
You're all a bunch of losers.
I have to work until midnight.
You look like a monkey.
Try to stay objective.
You look like a woman.
No one will do this.
You don't have to explain it to me.
Get me the evidence.
I had a bad dream last night.
He invited me to his house.
"If you don't want this, I'll give it to someone else."
Should I not have told Tom?
How's the weather?
We've had enough of that.
Tom may be there.
I didn't want Tom to think he had to help me.
"No, thank you. I'm full."
I'm not going to forgive you.
Is it ready?
Both were unconscious.
You're acting like a fool.
Tom hasn't paid his rent yet.
When did you buy this car?
Tom found me a taxi.
She is a quiet woman.
Sit here.
Are you upset?
The restaurant is empty.
I'll be back in a moment.
I thought Tom would help us.
He's a biologist.
You just don't get it.
I can do that way better than Tom can.
Tom is no longer in pain.
I think Tom should do that.
Your statements contradict each other.
"I was looking for Tom, but Tom found me first."
Tell me where you found it.
I was eighteen then.
I am eating rice.
How do they feel?
I got ripped off.
Where do we have to do that?
Everyone believed you.
I don't know much about politics.
How many times a month do you come here?
We're kidding.
You must answer the question.
Have you told Tom already?
This is our car.
I thought you didn't want me to stay.
Was that meant as a joke?
Tom grabbed his son by the scruff of his neck.
I don't think that Tom is drunk.
He is getting better.
Tom is a very capable businessman.
Tom gained weight.
My pen has run out of ink.
So we're gonna have a barbecue party. Tell your parents that my parents are gonna be there.
I thought you had to work.
I've asked Tom to stop doing that.
Let's not waste this opportunity.
"I'm to blame, not you."
Tom and Mary are both very hungry.
That too may help.
Will you leave a message?
He plays tennis three times a week.
It was personal.
Have you told Tom what to buy?
Tom stayed at home all weekend.
I saw him naked.
I don't know what I'm doing.
Do you like to draw?
I only eat vegetables.
Tom said that he didn't need anything.
You should've reported that to the police.
Tom doesn't understand what you want.
Is it just eight-thirty?
Did Tom talk to you about Mary?
I did a cartwheel.
Nobody will dance with me.
Tom said that he needed to borrow some money.
You must know I snore.
Do you think Tom will have time to help us?
Have you got a match?
It's demeaning.
I felt the same way.
There's no cure for stupidity.
I'm sure you're going to have a wonderful time.
The dog will not harm you.
It's easy for Tom.
Tom will wait for us.
Is flight 23 on time?
I want to know absolutely everything.
Silk feels soft.
I think this is good for us.
We're not going to lie to you.
Tom is curious.
Who gave you this wallet?
I don't want to embarrass you in front of your friends.
You don't work for me.
You must wonder who I am.
Is this bag yours or his?
I haven't seen them for ages.
Why don't you want to eat with us?
That's a separate question.
I know that you're Canadian.
Tom said he'd call you.
Do I need to sign anything?
You're boring.
Oranges are sweeter than lemons.
We leave in half an hour.
Can you go to the office by train?
I'm proud of our team.
I got lost.
Tom usually eats with us.
Do I have a fever?
Tom is going to see if he can do that.
You're not often wrong.
You're very strong.
It wasn't hers.
I can't force you to go.
I think he is honest.
Your dog is very big.
You should always keep your word.
Tom wants you to do him a favor.
Tom always eats before going to work.
We're really looking forward to it.
Are you sure you're not hungry?
He is not to be trifled with.
I've got to see Tom.
You'll find somebody.
Take off your shoes.
Sometimes cows are killed by coyotes.
I'm so jealous.
When does Tom sing?
You can buy it at any bookstore.
You've gone too far this time.
Where did you learn how to do this?
I've got to win this race.
I was relaxed.
Are you questioning my plan?
We have many reasons to be proud of our team.
Tom hasn't eaten anything today.
We don't know anything about Tom.
They weren't drunk.
Be sure to call me tomorrow morning.
I've been thinking a lot about Tom lately.
I had to do something.
Tom hasn't yet been told what to do.
He acts as if he were a king.
Tom didn't like Boston very much.
Tom was born in Australia.
I'll follow you.
"Of course, I have to tell Tom."
There won't be so many people there.
I'm a married man.
You need treatment.
They both blushed.
I don't feel like eating.
Tom intends to become a teacher.
I don't like this weather.
He angrily closed the door.
He was buried in this graveyard.
"Since he's busy, he can't meet you."
They helped each other.
It's happened again.
"The gestation period for the African bush elephant is about 669 days, whereas that for a guinea pig is only about 70 days."
We can't stop here.
Tom has been performing before large audiences lately.
We're going to freeze to death.
Do you plan to spend your summer vacation with Tom?
Tom is only three weeks old.
He comes at noon.
Tom is living in a small apartment on Park Street.
I didn't know he had decided to leave.
Who cares whose fault it is?
Where are the files?
You may swim.

I often listen to music while I'm studying.
I told Tom that I couldn't speak French.
"I was born in 1982 in Athens, where I still live today."

I'm aware of that.
"Tom is left-handed, isn't he?"
Can you explain why Tom isn't here?

I can't budge it.
Tom is meeting Mary in three hours.
It's against the law.
We can drive as fast as we want.
I went to the beach.
Tom didn't go to the meeting.
Nobody noticed your absence.
No sooner had he said it than he was sorry.
I have a lot of plans for the future.

Just don't laugh.
Both Tom and I were right.
Tell Tom we're on our way.

I thought that that was the right thing to do.
This doesn't surprise me.
I want Tom here.
I am happy to see you again.
I want you to meet Tom.

How stupid of me!
I know why he did it.

He is always with me.

Horses sleep standing up.
When is Tom going to do that?
There are oak trees in this forest.

Everybody knew that.
I'm extremely shy.

Everything is fine.
I see your pen.
Smoke filled the room.
Does Tom like classical music?
He died on the day his son arrived.
We won't do that without their permission.
Tom was lured into a trap.
They don't despise you.
I don't think that I needed to do that.
Can't I please just go?
We must continue.
I can't help feeling sorry for Tom.
Which direction are you going?
I almost sneezed.
It's hot.
I know you're hiding behind the curtain.
This is how to cook rice.
Tom isn't very sociable.
Aren't you a singer?
I prefer working alone.
He regretted having quit his job.
Please go on with your story.
I think that's for Tom to decide.
They're at home.
I didn't go by car.
Tom needed somebody he could trust.
Have you begun studying French?
I don't think Tom is cold.
What did Tom do last Monday?
I'm glad to finally meet you.
I thought you understood me.
Tom laughed politely.
Tom was as poor as a church mouse.
I've been told that you can't be trusted.

"Tom will translate French into English for free. ""That's good to know."""

Let Tom in.
Tom and Mary have been married for over 30 years.
I could've sworn I saw Tom there.
It isn't over yet.
Fish is good for you.
I told Tom to stay away from Mary.
I've got a feeling Tom doesn't really know how to speak French.
You were perfect.
The basket is full of bottles.
I don't know how to get along with those difficult people.
The bird flapped its wings.
Tom can go with us tomorrow.
Do you think we'll get to the station in time?
How dare you enter my house without permission!
Tom asked me to keep it secret.
I don't think it's safe to go out at night by yourself.
I can't go there now.
You've got a lot of guts.
Dry sand absorbs water.
You've already won.
She is over twenty.
I'll be really careful.
Tom needs to be home on Monday.
Don't trust your memory. Write it down.
Tom said that he has to go to school tomorrow.
That child certainly has a will of his own.
A river flows through the valley.
I won't lose anything.

He is in his library.
My hobby is collecting foreign stamps.
This is a really good show.
I actually don't drink all that much.
I wasn't able to buy a ticket.
I am happy to see you again.
Tom is going to win sooner or later.
Clean up the kitchen.
I couldn't live like that.
What a shame!
I didn't tell Tom where you lived.
That's not what I'm trying to say.
I'll call you tomorrow afternoon.
You must not come in.
Take your place.
I won't have to go there by myself.
The police questioned Tom again.
I don't think you're right.
What surprised you the most?
You look like a girl.
Did you hit Tom?
I am ashamed of your behavior.
I know why you're here.
I'm experienced.
Are you in Boston?
Tom was sitting alone on a bench.
Just believe me.
I've bought a car.
I can't believe Tom actually did that.
Tom drives a BMW.
Tom may be innocent.
We aren't like them.
I'm pretty sure that Tom has already gone home.
Do you think it'll rain today?
He lives as if he were a millionaire.
No one has seen Tom.
I work for a university.
Put in a little more sugar.
He has come a long way.
Wasn't that enough for you?
I believe I can handle it from here.
Are they all nuts?
I don't want you to do it.
Tom has done everything.
We've never done it this way before.
"You'll ask them, won't you?"

They can't afford it.
"Why, what do you mean?"
"Something's wrong, isn't it?"
You'd better go.
Do you want any of these books?
I always drink a glass of milk before going to bed.
Tom handed Mary the key.

Tom needs to get ready for school.
My job is easy and I have a lot of free time.
I knew what was going to happen.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
Do you know when Tom's birthday is?
Didn't you hear what I said?
You're the teacher.
Why do you like playing basketball?
It didn't take long before Tom found out about what Mary had done.
What is bullfighting?
We don't negotiate.
Kissing a person who smokes is like licking an ashtray.
Tom left Boston a few days before Christmas.
I am nothing but a poor peasant.
Who's got the tickets?
Tom started up the car.
He studied very hard.
I thought maybe this would help.
There are cookies in the oven.
Tom is back in his apartment.
I have absolutely no intention of ever doing that again.
You broke the rules.
May I show you something?
I waited for three minutes.
You are mistaken about that.
When was the last time you upset your father?
Everyone looked at my feet.

Lightning is usually followed by thunder.
I have a rough idea where it is.
Tom said that Mary was jealous.
My mom told me that I was fat.

I don't think that she will come.
I don't think we can afford it now.
How much money do you plan to invest in government bonds?
Tom said Mary has never driven a sports car.
Tom handed Mary an energy drink.
This time you won't be alone.
They wouldn't let me go.
Tom is extremely temperamental.
I've never seen you laugh.
Grab this.
Everyone is free to contribute.
"We considered going, but finally decided against it."
I'm not used to having people question my decisions.
Everyone wanted to do that.
I'm on a really tight schedule this week.
Tom didn't know the rules.
Did you enjoy the performance?
The court ordered her to pay the fine.
"I deserve happiness, too."

Languages change over time.
"Tom started to say something, and then changed his mind."
I'm not being cruel.
What's your favorite sport?
"I tried to solve the problem, but I couldn't."
I realized Tom wasn't joking.
Just tell me where it is.

Were you about to say something?
He was playing with a lighter.
I'd leave early if I were you.

Tom is on our team.
Please keep that secret.
He gets up at seven.
How old were you when you started studying French?
Just apologize.
I don't eat bread.
The light went out.
A fierce dog attacked the girl.
I knew the truth would scare you.
I'm not a cop.
They're afraid.
I'd help if I could.
Tom is always blaming himself.
Will you do this for me?
The door is locked at nine o'clock.
How much money did Tom lose?
"You will keep your word, won't you?"
How did you survive?
Please don't go to any expense on my account.
You deceived me.
Why was Tom arrested?
Is this the key your uncle is looking for?
Tom said he didn't want to wait for you.
I know the rules.

We didn't listen to music.
We don't do anything.
Do you often visit your grandparents?
Tom and I want to talk to Mary.
"In the late eighteenth century, a passport for an American was usually signed by the President of the United States."
Tom hasn't told me anything about you.
I know that Tom is a strong man.
Tom could probably teach French.
We have a dishwasher.
I'm 19.
Tom gave Mary the gun.
No one loves you.
"Haven't you had enough, Tom?"
It was a new experience for Tom.
We've got a lot to learn.
Let me hold your hand.
Can you open it?
He made me carry his baggage.
What did you say to Tom?
Don't procrastinate.
He does not know what it is to be poor.
Is there a desk by the window?
You've failed.
Tom loves to gossip.
The real heroes are us.
There were a lot of people in the park today.
I didn't notice whether Tom was there or not.

"Does Tom speak French, too?"
That was a good day.
I hear that you kissed my girlfriend.
"I didn't go yesterday, so I have to go today."
May I use your car today?
I suppose we could ask Tom.
Tom left Boston three days ago.
We've spent almost thirty years here.
There's no chance that he'll recover.
There's no more butter in the fridge.
What else do you want?
No one followed you.
I'm just looking.
I don't remember where I put my sunglasses.
How far is it from here to your house?
You'll miss Tom.
"If we stick together, we'll be able to survive."
Can you call him?
I just don't believe you.

I had no idea you were so stupid.
Tom claimed Mary was the one who did that.
He says he has always been true to his wife.
Ancient coins were found inside the mysterious tomb.
"How tall are you, and how much do you weigh?"
"You, too, can achieve success if you try."
Did you sleep well?

I'm sure that wasn't what Tom said.
I knew then that I was right.
Tom and Mary looked at each other and laughed.
He apologized to me for his rudeness.
Are you being coerced?
Tom said it was too late to change his schedule.
How many years ago did you realize you were adopted?
I hope that she will get well soon.
I think it was intentional.
You made a promise.
I feel like taking a bath now.
Give me your wallets.
I don't even know what that means.
Are you good at cooking?
I walked in the woods by myself.
My first girlfriend was a blonde.
Tom was arrested for shoplifting.
Tom arrived in Boston yesterday.
Tom turned the knob.
Let me introduce my parents to you.

I can't cook.
Call me if anything changes.
I know you were proud of me.
They arrived in Paris at the same time.
They passed the Cape of Good Hope.
I don't know anybody who can speak French.
I sometimes play tennis with Tom.

Could you take me there?
He's in trouble.
Do you like tofu?
I'm in prison now.
I think we're going to be OK.

Are you sure you heard something?
My house is in the middle of the town.
She went to Paris for the purpose of learning ballet.
I'm sure you'll tell me what I want to know.
I think your hypothesis is correct.
The teacher particularly emphasized that point.
Don't you think you should tell Tom about this?
Do you have any siblings?
Fill in your name and address here.
I'm done for today.
You'd better wait until the police come.
That's why I'm giving it to you.
I have no idea why Tom isn't here.
Do I seem old to you?
I forgot what I was going to say.
Tom joined us.
I don't think I can eat that.
"I'm disappointed in you, Tom."
Tom shouldn't have told you.
Tom is allergic to mold.
Tom fed his leftovers to his dog.

I was unable to complete the task.
I think I'll have the salmon.

Are you waiting for the bus?
Tom hasn't yet been told what happened.
Tom suspected Mary was using drugs.
We're eating popcorn.
I have to buy a car this weekend.
The first word of every sentence should be capitalized.
You said we'd never catch Tom.
I'm afraid you can't do that.
I know you want to be beautiful.
I'm not going to deny it.
What are your kids' names?
Tom wanted to have lots of children.
I grew up here.
We never talked about religion.
What are they suggesting?
The old man named the wooden doll Pinocchio.
I'm glad I've found you.
Can't you see we're busy?
I had great expectations for Tom.
Do you want me to handle this?
Aren't you going to vote today?
I need to stop reading the news.
It was empty.
How many tickets will you buy?
We have two kids.
I'll teach you how to swim.
I never should've gone there by myself.

Someone has to tell Tom what happened to Mary.
I don't deserve to live.
I want you to stay until Monday.
Where's my money?
Are you new?
Did you see the lunar eclipse yesterday?
Did Tom believe you?
Both girls laughed.
I do that three times a year.
Tell me about your trip to Boston.
Do you think we made the wrong decision?
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.
You just have to trust each other.
They won't speak to Tom.
She looks at least sixty.
Tell her that I am proud of her.
I'm not going to tell you why.
I will give you the money.
Do you have a cat?
I definitely won't do that.
Do you think he will like that?
The witch hunt has begun.
Tom wants you to have it.
Why don't you ask Tom yourself?
You're so smart.
We'll wait for your return.
I think these are genuine.
I thought Tom had already left.
Tom voted for it.
I was content.
The smell of the flowers came in through the open windows of the bus.
I saw Tom hiding something.
Which diet is better?
I'll do that for Tom.
Tom wants to be with us.
Tom was looking at the pictures that Mary took when I entered the room.
Tom forgot to release the brake.
These diamonds come from South Africa.
I don't like the way Tom cooks.
Stay as long as you like.
Tom was attacked by a bear.
What's it called again?
I've got to get some shut eye.
"Tom is in his room, writing a letter to his grandmother."
What does he expect?
There were too many people at the beach.
Why don't you get a haircut?
Have you ever been run over?
Tom doesn't know how to play tennis.
I didn't want to tell you that on the phone.
I can't help thinking of the future.
I went to school.
Her nose is bleeding.
I'll call you right after the meeting.
I don't care what Tom drinks.
I often lie about my age.
My wife buys vegetables from a supermarket nearby.
Tom came very near being hit by a car.
We were tired and hungry.
I need a secretary.
I want it back.
When was the last time you saw Tom?
Tom is aware of his shortcomings.
Tom could hear everything.
Tom is going to remain at home.
They won't listen to you.
I suggest we stay home and watch television.
I've never heard Tom complain about anything.
Tom sat down on the couch next to Mary.
"In clear weather, we can see the island from here."
My father and I sometimes go fishing.
"If I had known that you were here, I would have come at once."
Tom filled the bottle with drinking water.
Be sure to lock the door before you go to bed.
A puppy followed me wagging its tail.
Tom lives in a big house.
"Is he seriously ill? ""I hope not."""
Mary is dying for a chance to meet Tom.
Tom continued to eat the orange.
He will not listen to me.
He broke out into rage.
You hit the center of the target.
Did you remember to turn off the lights?
I knew you'd find me.
I listened to his story.
I didn't understand Tom's explanation.
Tom looked frightened.
I know you were in Boston last weekend.
"Tom is pretty smart, isn't he?"
Father wants to make me a doctor.
"It's my fault, not yours."
I don't plan to vote in the upcoming elections.
I'm not sure if this is correct.
Look at the picture.
I arrived in Boston on Monday.
Both Tom and Mary know that that isn't likely to happen.
Do you love him too?
I'm not going to see anybody else.
There's some cheese in the refrigerator.
There is a message for you.
They didn't like Tom.
We don't have the money to pay Tom.
I anticipated this.
"Tom is aware of that, isn't he?"
I can't find the restaurant.
I hope I never meet him again.
Do you have any plans?
No one is allowed to go there.
We often go there.
I'm not going to tell you why.
Don't stop playing.
It doesn't look like water.
You seem to be afraid of my dog.
Tom musn't know I'm here.
The world has five oceans.
We don't have a car.
That looks bad.
Tom didn't have to talk so loud.
That was a very good try.
Today was very hot.
I read books.
You don't have to do this.
What did you see?
I think that Tom is still sleepy.
Tom is the only one not sitting.
We got what we asked for.
Tom has been hospitalized.
Eat it while it's hot.
Tom said that he was worn out.
Can you show me where the bathroom is?
Don't sing here.
You can't help me.
Do you still work for Tom?
You can't sit here.
How much do you love Tom?
Are you sure you don't want to move to Boston?
I know all that.
I'll call you around 2:30.
We're not always right.
You're both fired.
I worked hard to succeed.
There's an orange on the table.
I have to think of the future.
Tom doesn't fear death.
Tom became weak.
You can't make bricks without straw.
"We're not so different, you and I."
You don't even have a car.
You can change it if you like.
Who was Mona Lisa?
She accused him of stealing her money.
Tom caught a large trout.
Tom doesn't know what Mary means when she says that.
Give me one more.
I don't think that Tom has time to help you today.
He prefers not to talk about it.
"The last I heard, Tom was in prison."
Tom doesn't think that'll happen.
I did it according to your instructions.
Hold this.
Take a bath and go to bed.
Tom threw his knife at Mary.
Have you ever saved someone's life?
What should a healthy breakfast consist of?
"When you finish reading this letter, burn it."
I need to talk to Tom right now.
I think you know Tom.
She thinks money and happiness are the same.
I didn't know your grandchildren lived in Boston.
I was in my bedroom.
What's your full name?
Do you think Tom is still scared?
The accident caused a traffic jam.
I learned a valuable lesson today.
Tom died recently.
Tom was trying to kill Mary.
Tom asked me if I knew Mary.
We've got to get rid of all this trash.
I need Tom.
Tom didn't need my help.
Why doesn't Tom want to go with us?
I want a suit made of this material.
My daughter studies in that school.
I should visit Boston.
You look like you haven't slept in days.
The river flows under the bridge.
Tom isn't very talented.
I think you know both of them.
This restaurant opened on October 20th.
I'll never forget having a good time with you all.
Are you going to the tennis court?

He told me to go home and I obeyed him.
I was a coal miner for thirty years.
He'll win for sure.
Who did you offend?
Is there a discount for students?
Tom was in a bad mood yesterday.
Does Tom help you wash windows?
Tom spends a lot of time doing that.
It's my only hope.
Come to my office.
We heard someone go upstairs.
"By the way, what's your address?"
It isn't as big a problem as you think it is.
"You've never liked me, have you?"
Tom thought Mary wouldn't likely be busy.
I won't allow you to ruin your life.
Do you care?
I'm sure Tom will help you.
The heavy rain prevented us from going fishing.
I wonder if Tom knows Mary's phone number.
It can be repaired.
Why haven't you told us yet?
I'm not like you.
I did thirty push-ups.
Add more water.
The rainy season has started.
She helped her younger brother finish his picture.
Did Tom say he'd be busy?
My situation is hopeless.
Ceasefire talks began in July 1951.
Why don't you go alone?
Don't worry. You'll get used to it.
I don't have to answer your question.
Do you know where I can find it?
I could be next.
Why didn't you let me know that you were in Boston?
I knew I should've gone with you.
I'll leave you alone.
I might be wrong.
I suppose you know where Tom is.
I know that you were in Boston last weekend.
They want to separate after 40 years of marriage.
My phone's ringing.
Have you seen this file?
I have no choice but to go.
Would you rather be blind or be deaf?
Scorpions have eight legs.
Can we talk about it tomorrow?
Haven't we been here before?
What else did you throw away?
What else did you buy?
I'll come by bicycle.
The portions are huge at this restaurant.
The girl broke the window.
The guards searched Tom's cell.
Where is my ball?
I already told you he isn't here.
I didn't think Tom would buy that.
Who's laughing downstairs?
You are not in a position to ask for anything.
Tom doesn't know much about that.
Is it a good play?
"Today's Monday, isn't it?"
Don't believe everything you see on TV.
My personal life is none of your business.
You look beautiful.
Asking questions is how we learn.
Tom had a car accident.
I don't want to jump the gun.
Tom went shopping with Mary.
Tom likes to go to the library.
Tom is fearless.
I didn't ask to be chosen.

Does that sound familiar?
Sorry for the harsh words.
I know Tom will help us do that tomorrow.
It's just a cat.
He told a friend that he felt very tired and weak.
Do you have any money?
Tom is waiting for us in his office.
She didn't come before two.
I was starting to worry.
He's proud to be an artist.
Tom did a victory lap.
"I'm not good at swimming. ""Neither am I."""

Did Tom really leave?
The river is dangerous.
I broke the law.
Somebody touched me.
Would you draw me a map?
He took a notebook out.
Give me back my pencil.
I know that you aren't ready.
Where do you want to go?
I hope I didn't offend you.
We could try.
What should we buy?
How much do I owe you for the ticket?
Tom stood watching.
"Don't just stand there, say something."
What kind of man are you?
I wasn't sure whether Tom was joking or not.
Have you ever thought of becoming a writer?
I tried to convince Tom otherwise.
How was your stay?
The medicine didn't stop the pain.
I'd like to know what's happening here.
"I'd like to help Tom, but I don't know how."
Tom fastened his seat belt.
I think we need Tom.
"Tom can't see you tonight, but he can see you tomorrow morning."
I'm not very good at French.
I suspected that something like this might happen.
Tom told me to take good care of you.
Tom has many friends living in Boston.
They have enough money for their bills.
Tom tried not to panic.
Tom has been fired.
I asked him if he knew her address.
There was nobody to ask.
I know why Tom is busy.
We'll start.
Please do that by tomorrow.
You and I can work together.
I don't want to tell anyone anything.
I bookmarked this website.
"If you don't hurry, you'll miss the last train."
Does anybody know that you're here?
Please drop me off at the station.
Tom waited for thirty minutes.
Heat up the water until it boils.
"He's not a doctor, but a nurse."
I haven't had my picture taken for years.

Why does Tom want to kill you?
I was paid well on my previous job.
They got thoroughly wet in the rain.
I know that you aren't a doctor.
Tom likes you.
We both almost missed the bus.
"If you would talk less and listen more, you might learn something."
Tom is sitting with Mary.
I have met neither of his sons.

Perhaps we'll meet again.
How do you know Tom didn't do anything?
I really don't feel good.
Tom and I are teachers.
I'm very excited.
We're going to work together.
Tom didn't want to answer the question.
"If you stay at a big hotel, you can use their swimming pool."
Don't run so fast.
You'll lose.
Tom claims he didn't know that was going to happen.
"The girl wanted to, but could not, tell him the truth."
We're going back to our hotel.
Don't do anything you'll regret later.
Hold the vase with both hands.
I gave the dog a bone. That stopped its barking.
Forgive Tom.
Tom is going to do that for me.
What else do you plan to do?
Is it broken?
I went outside.
I now regret my decision.
Tom asked everyone questions.
What Tom told you was a lie.
I'll be more careful.
The whereabouts of the suspect is still unknown.
My car has a flat tire.
Do you promise not to tell?
Tom often does that for us.

I'm not sure that this is a good idea.
You are a bit fat.
I paid in cash.
How do you know I even want that job?
We were together about three years.
I'll see Tom again on October 20th.
I did what you asked.
I think there's still a chance Tom will get here on time.
Tom is unpopular.
How much milk did you drink?
Tom wasn't a tourist.
I asked Tom if he had any suggestions.
Tom and Mary aren't here.
Where's everyone going?
Tom was one of the first people here today.
I've never heard Tom laugh.
Tom is present.
Maybe this isn't a problem.

Are you sure you know what Tom has to do?
Tom smiled innocently.
Tom knew the risks.
I want a knife.
I want to extend my stay here for a few more days.
Did Tom really tell Mary not to come here tomorrow?
Be careful not to break the eggs.
Will you swim?
I bought this as a gift for Tom.
How long ago did you find this?
We have to go there together.

This question is very simple.
"If not now, when?"
I'm not going to allow that to happen.
Tom said you wanted to see me.
I wouldn't allow that to happen.
Tom is narrow-minded.
I'd like to visit Boston one day.
Thanks for your quick answer.
I think that Tom is going to try to escape.
We have different opinions.
Tom danced with Mary.
I was going to leave you a note.
Why can't we speak French?
"Tom can't help you, but Mary can."
I don't want to be involved in that matter.
No one trusts you.
Was this man threatening you?
I'm sad without you.
You always lie to me.
Should we wait for you here?
I haven't seen you in ages.
A house without books is like a room without windows.
I wonder why I have to do that.
I really wish I knew why Tom didn't like me.
Tom missed a step and fell down the stairs.
This joke is crude.
Everything changes.

Don't smoke in here.
Do you think Tom is married?
A woman thinks of everything in terms of money.

Forgive me for wasting your time.

I can't go to the police with this.
We don't want any excuses.
Tom stood very close to Mary.
Did you know that Tom was living in Boston?

She's drop-dead gorgeous.
My favorite is this one.
"If she had not studied English here, she could not have passed the examination."
The campers sang songs around the campfire.
They knocked on the door and said they had come to arrest him.

I thought Tom would never find it.
"You were at home yesterday, weren't you?"
I wanted Tom to clean the living room.
Are you sure you're not hungry?
It looks like it is going to rain tonight.
Where were you when Tom needed your help?
Let's head for that tall tree.
Let them do it themselves.
We gave our word.
I thought that was impossible.
I think you're overreacting.
Are you experienced?
Now look what you've done.
I can't believe we're all still here.
I'll ask him.
You must go to the doctor.

I've seen that before.
Tom's a nice boy.
I wish I could stay with you.
You're a genius.
Tom will probably wait for you.

We can help.

Who has the key to this lock?
Take it home.
Are they your friends?

Run as fast as possible.
It's a big achievement.
Please hold on tight.
Are you students?

Do you think you're normal?

We need a volunteer.
I think she'll succeed.
I likely won't be here tomorrow.
It's not what you think.
You shouldn't have borrowed Tom's car.
I knew you'd say that.
I said enough.
This is the reason why he did it.
Is Tom injured?
Thanks for the cup of coffee.
"Forget about it, OK?"
How did Tom know we were coming?
Please do not open the windows.
He became a famous singer.
I should be there.

This is the room where the body was found.
Don't worry. Everything is fine.

The classroom was quiet.
She has been looking after her sick sister for ten years.
For some reason the microphone didn't work earlier.

You'll need sleep.
Let's skip dessert.

I'm afraid we don't have the time.
I am very pleased.
This is where I was born and brought up.
We need to come up with a new plan.
Education is one of the most essential aspects of life.
I wish that Tom had shown me how to do that.
I've never driven a truck.

You must apologize to Tom.
Tom is the one laughing.
Tom wrote an article about it in the school newspaper.
You made it.

There's no one in the room.
It was so cold my ears hurt.
They have seen better days.

Tom can find the time to do that.
Would you mind closing the door behind you?
He is what we call a musical genius.
He has a bright future.
Tell her that I know who she is.
Are you sure you just want water?
I got my right leg injured.
I wouldn't bet on it.
Did you see a doctor?
It was stupid.
It's hard to say for sure.

It wasn't his.
Tom forgot to flush the toilet.
I can't excuse her.
I want to borrow your car tomorrow.
Is there anything else you would like to eat?
My family thinks I've lost my mind.
Do whatever you want.
I thought they wouldn't like you.
You should go back there.
Fast forward to the part where they're kissing.
They refused to admit they were wrong.
I will go there on foot or by bicycle next time.
Be realistic!
Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1935.
It's quite possible Tom will do that.
Why haven't you brought me here before?
Tom gave this to me before he died.
Tom was wounded by a bullet.
What do you know about that?
Tom was determined to make the football team.
Would you sing us a song in French?
"Go on Tom, drink it."
Tom is old enough to vote.
You promised that you wouldn't drink today.
"We missed you, too."
Tom said he knew Mary would do that.
I've got to tell you something.
I saw him with my own eyes.
Take the medicine three times a day.
Who's your favorite actor or actress?
I like being with you.
I'll go and look for Tom.

I've put money aside in case I run into some unforeseen problem in the future.
Tom is the only one here who knows Mary.
Lake Biwa is the largest lake in Japan.
I'll be your bodyguard.
I saw a sleeping dog.
I'm cured.
Why can't you come?
I must go and see him.
How will Tom do that?
I can't believe you.
Tom's mother thought he needed to make some new friends.
Do you spend more time at home or at work?
I wanted to impress you.
I tried to protect you from this.
There's no cause for alarm.
Tom's too far gone to help.
It's very unlikely that Tom will come.
Does Tom really think we're that stupid?
Tom smiled knowingly.
Tom will be at home tomorrow.
I couldn't speak to Tom.
I didn't want you to read that.
Has the baby woken up?
I cannot understand what you say.
Tom is blind in one eye.
Show us where you found it.
I'm sure Mom will get mad.
Tom was living in Boston.
Tom scratched my new guitar.
I'll go and see if Tom is OK.
He measured all his shelves.
I hate my mother-in-law.
She's neither rich nor famous.
"She seldom, if ever, goes out after dark."
I love the smell of freshly baked bread.
You did something that I would never do.
You are free to talk with anyone.
What are you going to Australia for?
This moment will be recorded in history.
It was extremely weird.
I have no place to keep my things.
I need to go back.
Tom treated everybody the same.
Tom learned to drive when he was thirteen.
"As far as I know, that never happened."
The house fell down a week later.
I want to do some shopping.
He discovered that he had made a mistake.
Can you come here?
Can you remember this game?
Tom says that he won't do that.
Do you really think Tom will want to go with us?
We have nothing to talk about.
The situation is worse than we thought.
Let me show you where Australia is on the map.
Do you like mine?
"I can't help you, Tom."
"If you want to lose weight, you'll have to be careful about what you eat."
What else can I show you?
It works now.
This is an old Scottish song.
The trains are running on schedule.
They definitely saw us.
I couldn't stop Tom.
Tom said I looked satisfied.
I am like my father.
How many times have you been arrested?
You know that that isn't true.
Where did I put that box?
Tom wanted to be an opera singer.
I brought dinner.
Tom woke up with a terrible headache.
A slip of the tongue is sometimes fatal to a politician.

This is not my first time riding a bicycle.
Why's Tom still crying?
I was with Tom all day.
What do you remember?
I'll never fail you.
A new road is under construction.
You look gloomy.
We were eating apples.
I thought it had started to rain.
"Tom is able to say ""I can only speak French"" in thirty languages."
Tom planted flowers.
Someone locked me in the room.
Tom wants to become a doctor.
Is that person Tom?
"I'm not rich, but not poor either."
There are no oranges on the table.
I came here to study.
Are you a model?
I was more flexible when I was younger.
I didn't know you played chess.
Don't you love your wife?
It's for my science project.
That's not going to happen to me.
I have already read today's paper.
How did you learn to do that?
I'm no liar.
I tried to pretend I was something I wasn't.
Tom has a hostile attitude.
The hunters aimed their rifles at the elephant.
Tom begged Mary to stay longer.
I am weak in math.
I'm sure I'll pass the exam.
Boston is a lot like Chicago.
I told you I was going to do it.
That's why I like you.
I'd rather die than surrender.
I don't know either boy.
I knew you were OK.
Who will play the role of the princess?
I've been given permission to do that.
Watch your language.
I know that you still love Tom.
He's my friend. Do you know him?
Let's give it to Tom.
"Don't trust Tom, no matter what he says."
Tom thinks that Mary will win.
I have warm feelings for that doll.
Give this book to Tom.
I want to know why you weren't at the meeting this morning.
Won't you come up and have a drink?
This recipe is my grandmother's.
A stay of execution was ordered at the eleventh hour.
Let's play catch.
Tom reached into the fridge and pulled out a bottle of beer.
The job is not suitable for young girls.
Are you still on a diet?
Tom rode a horse for the first time yesterday.
Is French your native language?
They chose Tom as their leader.
It's just your imagination.
I'm pretty sure that Tom is in love with Mary.
She surprised him with a kiss.
The answer was easy.
Why do people like to smell their own farts?
He rolled his eyes.
"Apart from his parents, no one knows him very well."
Here or to go?
I am convinced that he did nothing wrong.
Does that matter?
I knew Tom wouldn't do that.
He succeeded.
I've just come back.
I was asked to lie.
I'm going to help you do that.
What are you planning on cooking for dinner tomorrow?
I don't think I'll make it.
You'd better not drink the tap water.
Where were you hiding?
Tom isn't doing anything today.
Is Tom wearing the new shirt you bought for him?
He has two houses.
Tom cradled the baby in his arms.
She bought him a camera.
I can hear something.
Tom talked to me about Mary.
Tom gave a bitter laugh.
He is having lunch now.
It was a good plan.
I might make a mistake.
Do you need anything else?
I was a bit emotional.
I'm glad Tom was able to win.
She helps us.
Tom got home at midnight.
He sang a song.
How many songs have you written?
I'm in a good mood.
You must sell it.
Will you show me your photo album?
He stole her watch.
Don't you think it's weird?
Tom has a good heart.
I'm sure Tom doesn't do that anymore.
We just didn't want to do that.
No one feels like fighting.
"If Tom hadn't rescued Mary, she would've drowned."
Tom isn't famous.
Tom tore out a couple of pages from his notebook.
Tom is bothering me.
What do you think about it?
We're always thinking about it.
Who will go there is not yet decided.
"If it were true, what would you do?"
Tom has come to see you.
I know Tom will agree.
When did Tom and Mary start going out with each other?
I haven't slept so well for months.
What do you like?
Come on up here.
I suspect Tom wasn't really surprised.
There won't be enough food for everyone.
I said I'm tired of it.
Who did you go swimming with?
I'll call you up this evening.
How can I tell if I'm really in love?
What didn't you like about my idea?
We'll all miss you when you're gone.
Tom said he couldn't leave without saying goodbye to Mary.
I spent a month in Boston.
Don't help me. I want to do this by myself.
You could help us.
Tom lives by the lake.
Let's eat out tonight.
Save your energy.
There weren't any other elephants nearby.
I'm 100% sure of my decision.
He had three-day measles the other day.
I'm glad to see you're happy.
I'll be brief.
He is tired of watching television.
Is it worth fixing?
Tom needs to go home early.
Tom takes care of Mary.
It'll be a long day.
What's your favorite radio station?
I wish you success.
Where's the honey?
I've been eating protein.
What are you doing Monday?
They are facing financial problems.
I called the police.
I'm sorry you lost.
We've been friends for over thirty years.
Tom finally gave up smoking.
You know it's a lie.
The party has been canceled due to a lack of interest.
"You have an assistant, right?"
Tom can't do anything without Mary's help.
Tom told me not to go there by myself.
Tom said that Mary wasn't hungry.
"I think we shouldn't be doing this. ""No one asked you."""
Who do you want to speak to?
Why should I buy something I'll never use?
You said you'd get something to eat.
We're getting better.
Where is Tom anyway?
Tom wasn't sure of anything.
My uncle works in this office.
I'll take care of it tomorrow.
I really do love Boston.
I have asked him.
The infection has spread quickly.
I'm teasing you.
I didn't know why Tom was so busy.
"Last week, I was in Australia with my wife."
Tom complimented Mary.
I want to feed the birds in the park.
Tom stayed in his car.
Do you have a reservation?
"Tom promised to come, but he didn't."
What do you find so amusing?
You'd better not do it.
Open your mouth and stick out your tongue.
I haven't read the report yet.
I almost never work on Saturdays.
"That's what I think, too."
You're doing it wrong!
The police are still questioning Tom.
Tom asked Mary which wine she liked better.
"I'll miss you, Tom."
Why aren't you wearing the bracelet I gave you?
I was almost late for school this morning.
You've only got thirty seconds to explain yourself.
I was lost.
I want to wait another week.
Tom suspected Mary had cheated on the test.
Who knows?
Few people have typewriters.
The plates are dirty.
"If Tom were here, what would you say to him?"
I know what you went through.
Tom is ill.
Were you the one who told Tom about what happened?
Did Tom say anything to you about what happened?
Would you marry me?
Promise not to tell anyone.
Nobody likes to pay taxes.
Tom is my classmate.
I don't have any other choice.
Let me say one thing.
Butter and cheese are made from milk.
No one's died.
I don't think Tom can help us today.
Our biking trip in the French Alps lasted two weeks.
Tom just returned from Boston.
It won't happen.
We'll be happy.
Tom wasn't home alone.
Tom lost his glasses.
Have you finally made up your mind?
Do you live in Boston?
You're just like your mother.
Tom forgot to call his mother.
Tom came up with a plan.
Tom got his nose broken in a fight.
Tom said he knew what Mary needed to do.
Tom called from Boston.
Tom voted against you.
I'd never hurt Tom.
Don't talk to Tom that way.
"If you do that, you'll ruin everything."
I feel very good.
It's not a problem at all.
It's getting out of control.
He is past forty.
I'm sorry that I couldn't go with you.
Don't forget to turn off the light before you go to sleep.
I'll never allow you to go.
I will be free tomorrow afternoon.
Tom got tired of waiting.
She gave birth to twins a week ago.
Tom said it didn't bother him at all.
"In general, men are taller than women."
I ate way too much.
You're not my mom.
I'm not lying.
I am too tired to run.
I learn French in school.
It was Tom that told me this story.
Tom seldom makes mistakes.
Things are not always what they seem.
Are you sure there's no solution?
I don't know what I was thinking.
I had to work hard when I was young.
Tom is a strange person.
That's really hard.
Where were you on the evening of October 20th?
Don't worry. I told you everything would be OK.
That sounds like a fairly good proposal.
I told Tom I wasn't interested.
Tom is being serious.
You need a doctor.
You didn't keep your word.
I like cats.
We were all wondering where you went.
He is selfish and greedy.
Mary wore a silver pin on her coat.
Tom lost his favorite pen.
Let's not do that anymore.
"We're not disturbing you, I hope."
Do you really think Tom will do that?
Tom will try persuade Mary to do that.
My sister showed a new watch to me.
He knows how to interrogate people.
Why are you so serious?
They're hiding in the woods.
Just watch me.
Tom didn't understand Mary.
He licked his fingers.
They are not little children.
Figure it out yourself.
I'm about done.
I hope that Tom will marry Mary.
I'll give you something.
You're very photogenic.
I won't shut up.
"What're you looking at, Tom?"
The second lesson is very easy.
Students are forbidden to smoke on the school grounds.
We are hungry.
I have seen her three times.
These shoes don't fit me anymore.
Tom was in prison for three years.
This novel was written by a famous American writer.
My father always reads the newspaper before breakfast.
Swimming develops our muscles.
The train was on time.
I love talking to you.
"You can use my car, if you want to."
Do you think your money is safe in a bank?
Do you want to do it together?
I wonder why Tom is worried.
I'm sure that Tom will be back tomorrow.
Put it on my desk.
You don't have to talk to me if you don't want to.
Never be afraid to make mistakes.
Will you show it to me?
I buy a lot of magazines.
He brought food to his guest and provided him shelter.
What makes you think Tom was talking about you?
I promised.
Tom didn't talk about you.
Tom realized Mary was getting tired.
I was hoping Tom would be able to help us.
The sun is rising.
Tom isn't giving up yet.
Tom doesn't have a TV at home.
Who did you visit yesterday afternoon?
The old man lives alone.
Let me have a talk with Tom.
He'll be back by Monday morning at the latest.
Tom's not in the office.
The evolution of dinosaurs interests me greatly.
"No matter how long it takes, I will finish the job."
I'm afraid of drowning.
Tom said he didn't want to stay at an expensive hotel.
I was negligent.
Tom will arrive on October 20th.
The only problem is Tom didn't leave.
We'll be hungry.
What exactly is our plan?
Is it always hot like this?
Is it really so terrible?
Now eat your supper.
Read this.
Turn the radio down a little.
Soldiers shared their food with the Indians.
I need to talk to someone.
I've already promised Tom I'd help him.
"Your name wouldn't be Tom, by any chance, would it?"
I'm glad you told me.
We're sorry.
I think you've been watching too much TV.
That's what I'm doing.
Tom made me promise not to tell Mary.
Tom often listens to sad songs.
The boys will be happy.
Opinions are not facts.
I've got nothing to say to him.
These trousers are dirty.
I ran.
"Of course, you don't remember."
Please bring a dictionary.
It saved me.
One of my sons is an engineer.
I don't know who Tom gave that to.
"In this company, there are more women than men."
We still need money.
I'm going to come back.
I doubt Tom will ever forgive me.
The explosion shook the whole building.
I want a divorce.
I'm as disappointed as you are.
Something here isn't making sense.
Did you ask Tom why he wasn't here yesterday?
He survived the plane crash.
Try another one.
Control yourself.
Tom is a little disoriented.
Did anybody call on you yesterday?
Don't worry. I'll help you.
He worked for a rich man.
Tom told me I was the one he wanted to talk to.
I recognized you.
You've got nothing to be afraid of.
I'm usually at home in the evening.
Do it as you are told.
What Tom did didn't go unnoticed.
The kid already speaks pretty well.
Her dream is to visit Paris.
They often drop in at my house.
"The house is too big for us, and what is more, it is too expensive."
We should talk calmly to each other.
I don't think we'll ever know what happened to Tom.
Having good oral hygiene is important.
I wonder why Tom asked that question.
I passed the exam.
Why doesn't Tom want to go?
Tom plays tennis after school.
It's only a question of time.
I don't know why Tom hates me so much.
I'm going to pretend that didn't happen.
Do you think that I look like Tom?
"I'd like to play cards. ""So would I."""
It needs to be fixed.
I have a problem.
That's why I lied.
I don't know. You should ask Tom.
I worked hard.
Tom didn't tell us when he planned to do that.
Christopher Columbus did not discover America.
We both know what happened.
Just follow them.
Tom is on holiday with his parents.
Sing me a love song.
You should come back immediately.
Do you want pizza or not?
We're not lying to you.
Tom turned on the car radio.
Can I call you back in twenty minutes?
Tom is fasting.
Where did Tom buy these shoes?
It wasn't supposed to be this way.
Do you believe in true love?
I'd really like to know.
Tom was never late for school.
Only Tom can tell us what needs to be done.
The puppies nestled against their mother.
It's pretty routine.
We'll work the problem out.
Tom and I are both very proud of you.
Tom's new girlfriend is much younger than he is.
Tom told Mary to be polite.
I know that Tom is a brave man.
He glanced at his watch.
Didn't you know Tom didn't need to do that?
It is necessary for you to think about your life.
It is very expensive.
Tom is already back.
Where's Boston?
Did you really think I'd leave without you?
Can you tell me what this means?
He doesn't stand a chance against his opponent.
Does Tom have to write the letter today?
Who cheated?
Was it useful?
Can't you find it?
But you're not there.
I want you to try it.
When did the robbery take place?
Let's do this first of all.
I asked Tom if he needed more time.
When and where exactly did you buy that?
I won't betray your trust.
I am listening to the radio.
Why can't I go?
You did that quickly.
Tom said that Mary didn't look very much like her mother.
I didn't expect it.
My father can speak French as well as English.
They're both drunk.
This is the town where he was born.
Tom must've seen Mary there.
I'll get over it.
Where should I park?
Why don't you want to go to school?
Who paid for the coffee?
Tom started taking boxing lessons when he turned twelve.
I won't leave you.
Tom will be shocked.
How did you know that was going to happen?
I've done the wrong thing.
Don't be so childish.
Tom is more talented than Mary.
Tom loves you so much.
I asked Tom to be here by 2:30.
The plane crashed.
I'm the one who stole the painting.
I didn't know you were rich.
Are the cherries ripe enough to pick?
Show me your papers!
You look so happy.
He is younger than me by three years.
I received your message yesterday.
I didn't pass today's exam.
Tom said you were crazy.
It isn't new.
Put the book back in place.
It is like looking for a needle in a haystack.
Tom fell asleep with the light on.
He took a look at the newspaper before going to bed.
This is your country.
Everything smells so delicious.
That's not what he said.
May I interrupt?
Tom took the microphone away from Mary.
Nobody answered the phone.
Everybody laughed except Tom.
We don't work for Tom anymore.
Bring him to me.
Plum blossoms come out in March.
Did you order this?
Did you know peanuts aren't really nuts?
I wish you a happy birthday.
Can you tell me where it is?
Tom overtook me.
Why didn't you sing with us?
Tom will call you every day.
You're a racist.
What problems did you have?
I need to know that Tom is happy.
Do you have an alarm clock in your room?
Can usernames be changed?
"You didn't know them, did you?"
I wish that I hadn't gone to Australia with Tom.
I think that I came too early.
You're not like me.
You'll like Tom.
What time did you wake up?
I don't think we need to do it.
I wouldn't wait if I were you.
They attempted in vain to bribe the witness.
I insulted Tom.
Tom willed all his property to the city.
Tom bought Mary a ring.
They followed you.
Hit the brakes!
Did you call the plumber?
It hurts so much.
I'm worried about the safety of the passengers.
I'll give it to Tom.
We know you're a vegetarian.
You look different today.
Why were you so offended?
There's not enough light in this room for sewing.
Have you finished writing the report?
Tom only eats lean meats and vegetables.
Did you know that Tom is blind in one eye?
Tom untied the ropes.
Where is the washroom?
"I know who you are, and I know why you're here."
I told you not to move.
"Tom is going with you, isn't he?"
We've been busy.
This tastes good.
I'm glad you were there.
They have hostages.
You don't have to be so formal.
She managed to escape.
Go and wake Mary up.
Why aren't we allowed to swim here?
When did Tom arrive?
"Excuse me, waiter. There's a hair in my soup."
I don't have time to sleep.
Would you like to go fishing with me?
We confirmed the hotel reservations by telephone.
The best way to predict the future is to invent it.
I thought you understood.
Tom no longer loves Mary.
Tom is in his room studying French.
Did you like that or not?
"When I last saw him, he was wearing a blue shirt and white slacks."
I get the feeling you don't really want me to win.
His love grew cold.
I heard that you're taking French lessons.
I'm emotionally drained.
Tom gave a false address to the police.
How long did it take to do that?
I'm afraid I'm on the wrong train.
Did I mention Tom was a doctor?
The prices fell suddenly.
Don't be such a couch potato.
Look at all those people.
I'm trying to be brave.
I didn't know Tom came from Boston.
Do you understand what I want to say?
We're going to find out.
It's the least we can do.
You said you'd do anything for me.
We were disappointed in him.
I shouldn't have yelled at you.
How long ago did you start learning Esperanto?
I've been in Australia before.
What time will Tom get back home?
I thought that Tom would bring us something to eat.
I didn't vote for you.
He will be pleased to help you.
Would you mind leaving us alone?
I can't remember whether I turned off the gas or not.
The man ran away.
Tom never used to drink milk.
I need to find work.
She says that she's lonely.
Are there a lot of tall buildings in Boston?
It's getting hot in here.
Thanks for your quick reply.
I won't let anybody do that.
This is the first time that I've seen a ship this big.
He took a week off.
This is very difficult work.
I don't want tea.
I've saved a lot of money.
Let's forget about what just happened.
I didn't drink much.
Tom was beat up.
No one ever tells us anything.
These mushrooms aren't edible.
Tom started to get a little angry.
Tom thanked me for warning him.
I think this is yours.
The box was so heavy I could not move it.
Why did Tom lie?
How many books did you read?
I haven't the foggiest idea.
She was always practicing the piano.
I can't stop.
Do you enjoy studying French?
I don't know what's going to happen.
I like chocolate.
Tom is very scared.
I just wanted to ask you a question.
Tom really likes chocolate.
They won't make it.
I know that Tom had to do that today.
Would you like to eat some fried potatoes?
Tom brushed his horse.
He is kind.
What did you want to talk to Tom about?
No one knows for sure.
I don't think that Tom knows how to play the oboe.
"Ready or not, we have to leave right now."
Nothing happens by chance.
Why can't you just do what I tell you to do?
Don't think about it. Do it.
I think that's Tom.
We're not safe.
I've never thought about giving up.
What would you do if you were here now?
I didn't know Tom didn't have a driver's license.
Do you want me to lock the door?
He founded the school five years ago.
I want to play football.
We have another problem as well.
I looked at the moon.
You must realize that I can't help you.
Tom had his sweater on inside out.
"Unfortunately, I can't accept your invitation."
"In any case, I'll inform you when he comes."
I could do that again.
I don't think Tom knows very much about Mary.
Do you remember the town where he was born?
He is blinded by love.
Please tell me how to spell your name.
I'll never forget you.
Every student has to leave school by six.
Tom didn't even bother to reply.
Tom saw what Mary was doing.
I live very modestly.
It's still closed.
Tom left his briefcase on the subway.
I know your brother.
I want to lose weight.
I know the reason why Tom is mad at Mary.
Do you have any books in French?
You should've gone with Tom.
Do you think it's OK to eat this?
Tom said that he didn't to want to talk about Mary.
The water is not fit to drink.
Tom is a good diver.
Tom said that he'd take care of Mary.
I promised not to say anything.
Were you able to convince Tom to do that?
The cat sat on the table.
How much wine do you think Tom drinks every day?
"When he spoke, everyone became silent."
Tom isn't going to buy a new car.
I was in the house when that happened.
Tom is going to go to Boston next weekend.
Tom and Mary were walking down the path with fishing poles slung over their shoulders.
Can you recommend a good hotel in Boston?
Mt. Fuji is known to everyone.
"He was very tall, so I recognized him at once."
He was all alone in the house.
This is my job.
My shift's over in a couple of hours.
Tom should resign.
You're taking a big gamble.
I don't think that I'm going to see Tom.
The answer is pretty simple.
What's your blog about?
Let me hold it.
I'll be in Australia for another three days.
All four of my son's great-grandmothers are still living.
Are you ready to go?
Stay out of my way.
I don't see eye to eye with my father.
When will it start?
Will you be home for Christmas?
You ate my sandwich.
That's it.
I know I'm going to learn a lot.
This is a farce.
Did you find the leak?
You need a lot of water.
Please open the bottle.
It was Tom's idea.
Tom said he was forced to do that.
I think Tom still needs to do that.
Be careful. It might be a trap.
He is not aggressive enough to succeed in business.

I don't think that I'll need to do that.
Tom filled his glass with wine.
She cooks very well.
I hope you're right about this.
Tom is my baby.
You may leave now.
How is the investigation going?

I think it's a great idea.
He was thrown in prison for robbery.
Tom gave Mary three dollars and John thirty dollars.

I'm very short of money.
Did Tom say why he wanted to quit?
"You aren't going to the party dressed like that, are you?"
A friend gave me some tips on how to make a simple but impressive dinner.

Do you promise not to tell anybody anything?
Today is too hot for sunbathing.
One of the tigers has escaped from the zoo.
We're leaving right now.
They'll be arriving any moment.

Tell her that I am angry with her.
Tell Tom I don't have his keys.
My family is more important to me than my job.
Tom is probably rich.
You're irresistible.
I feel your pain.
Do you come here often?
I think everybody makes mistakes.
We all made it back safely.
We've been here long enough.
Tom is infuriated.
This is necessary.
I can't imagine that.
Think carefully before answering.
Tom is downstairs.
He stopped smoking because his wife and children asked him to.
The murder weapon wasn't found.
He told us a lie.
The parking lot was almost empty.
Boston isn't all that far away.
I wish I hadn't forgotten to do that.
I learned that when I was a kid.
I didn't hear you say it.
No one will hurt you.
Don't you think it's funny?
Did you ask them to wait?
Tom's hungry.
Tom has been to Boston three times.
Let me try.
We can play either tennis or baseball here.
Have you known Tom a long time?

Cool down.
I want the whole world to know that we're in love.
Tom begged Mary for mercy.
He sat on the bank.
We've got to stay together.

It is a song.
I don't want to eat this.
Did you really think I wouldn't find out the truth?
I have nothing to write.
I wish I knew Tom's telephone number.
It doesn't look good.
I hope Tom comes on Monday.
Are you still waiting for the bus?
I must speak with you.
That bicycle belongs to our school.
We never work on Monday.
I'll call Tom in a few minutes.
Tom eventually became Mary's husband.

You won't understand.
Would you lend me your pen?
Tom is lying unconscious on the ground.
I lost my way in Boston.
Tom said Mary was going to do that by herself.
It's a big deal to me.
Ask Tom where Mary lives.
Is that so bad?
I have doubts about his career.
I didn't think you were so old.
I don't know if you remember me.
Tom looks very pale.
I used to feel the same way.
I wasn't armed.
I left my wallet in the car.
I don't like to cook.
"All right, let's try it again."
"I saw Mary naked, but I wish I hadn't."

Don't be afraid of speaking in public.
Tom is now ready to talk.
I don't think Tom can do that without my help.

Don't you remember me?
Where are the rest of the boys?
I'm really looking forward to my birthday party.
Tom may have already left for Australia.
I don't know which bus to take.
I know that doesn't matter.
I'm feeling much better today.
We're glad you're coming.
All our attempts were in vain.
Tom might bleed to death if we don't get him to a hospital soon.

This isn't fun anymore.
World War II ended in 1945.
Who did you vote for in the election?
Did Tom eat anything?
I don't have anything to eat.
How often does Tom go to Boston?
Why do you spend so much time watching TV?
Many of the votes were illegal.
You said that you hated Tom.
That's what Tom was hiding.
We won't be long.
I'm glad that you can come.
Whose fault was that?
We're waiting for dinner.
Will you excuse me for a moment?
We can't live without air and water.
Have you used it yet?
It's nothing that can't wait.
Tom would be so proud.
Tom slept much longer than he had intended.
The tree grew very tall.
Perhaps we've met before.

This will work.
Tom thought Mary wouldn't like John.
Tom drove to Mary's house.
You've outdone yourself.
You deserved it.
Tom proceeded to the next question.
That was my choice.
I don't feel like eating anything today.
I really don't think that's necessary.
What did you say her name was?
Are you sure you haven't forgotten anything?
I think I did that right.
Didn't you know Tom was still studying French?
I'm the one who came up with the idea.
It's going to help you.

The students asked questions one after another.
Do you still want to go to Boston?

I hope to see you there.
We're here for Tom.
Do you think Tom didn't hear me?
You aren't alone.
Tom will eat later.
Tom doesn't know where Mary usually goes skiing.
Visiting all the tourist sights really wore me out.

We've discussed this many times already.
Would you like some wine?
Don't blow it.
I made some calls.
Who can solve the problem?
Keep a good eye on Tom.

I was sad and lonely.
I'll call you if anything changes.
We can't force people to do that.
I wish that I hadn't taken the bus.
"If you don't know, who does?"
I'll be honest with you.
I don't want to fire you.
I won't be here.
I'm trying to keep Tom alive.
What could happen?

I sincerely feel sorry for you.
I've decided not to help you anymore.
I want to spend more time with Tom.
I think you might need some help.
Tom sat up in bed and looked around.
Tom will be waiting for you.
Tom isn't bothering anybody.
It's unnecessary.

He will surely succeed in his new job.
Do you want to listen to some music?
I'm about to go out.

I wouldn't have made it without you.
Tom often wears a hat.
Tom is a psychic.
We hope that you won't do that.
Tom was wearing a uniform.
Why didn't you return?
The nurse handed Tom some pills and he took them.
I ought to wear this tie more often. I've gotten a lot of compliments today.
I hope no one was injured.

His house was small and old.
Tom was a single dad.
Is there a supermarket near here?
Is this all you can give me?
We won't bother you.
I don't think Tom knows why Mary is scared of him.
Why did Tom send you this?
I didn't realize you were so rich.
Tom hasn't had an easy life.
Wait till the light turns green.
I almost gave up.
Do you want to know why Tom isn't here today?
He asked me to help him.
I know what you did last summer.
There's no evidence Tom did that.
"You don't understand women, Tom."
That's why Tom doesn't like Mary.
I wanted you to feel at home.
The picnic was cancelled due to the rain.
I look like Tom.
I'm finishing my homework.
A heavy snow fell in Kyoto for the first time in ages.
Tom chose the largest apple for himself.
He likes singing.
This jacket fits pretty well.
It's mine.
I consider you a friend.
Few people have a typewriter.
Please move.
The house with the green roof is mine.
Have you ever seen an unidentified flying object?
I told Tom you were busy.
Tom doesn't seem very hungry.
"What are you talking about, Tom?"
Tom is trying to kill me.
You can do anything you like.
I love you a lot.
There's someone waiting for me outside.
Do you believe it now?
Tom has $300 at most.
I don't think I'm biased.
I don't want people to hate me.
I didn't understand.
Is that why you went to Australia?
You're not invited.
Why do zebras have stripes?
I don't want your pity.
Tom thought nobody knew what he was doing.
What brings you here?
Call me tomorrow.
Can you complete the work in three days?
We've learned a lesson.
You've overdone it.
"Your name, please."
I don't come here very much.
"I am not a bird, but I'd like to be."
What's the text about?
Tom is probably waiting for you.
How far is it from your house to town?
You'd better stay.
I could kill you.
What did he see?
A table has four legs.
Tom will be glad to see you.
The river's water level has risen.
I continued reading the book.
I think you know why.
You've made me angry.
Who did you buy this car for?
He is one of my neighbours.
Tom plays tennis very well.
Tom is with me.
I'm hardly ever home.
I think you can keep it.
I was serious.
I didn't come here to discuss Tom.
Yesterday a foreigner spoke to me in English on the train.
I'd like to kiss you.
I think you know the answer.
You should have told him.
He will have done his homework by tomorrow.
Show me your papers!
He has been sick since last night.
Don't leave me here alone.
Didn't you know Tom was asleep?
These flowers have a unique smell.
Did you know Tom was hungry?
Tom and Mary switched places.
I'm afraid it won't work.
I'm biased.
Do you study French at school?
Tell Tom the problem is solved.
I'm seeing double.
I think Tom shouldn't tell Mary about the accident.
Haven't you returned those books yet?
"You can fix it, can't you?"
Are you sure Tom won't remember anything?
Tom didn't want anyone to see him doing that.
Please write to me when you get there.
What business is that of yours?
What's your main reason for studying French?
You're probably wondering who I am.
There's nothing in my attic.
Tom is behaving oddly.
Does Tom know why you did that?
I have something.
Tom is a law-abiding citizen.
I deserve the prize.
I don't think that I can do that for you.
"You recognize her, don't you?"
Rise and shine.
Tom asked Mary what she wanted him to buy.
"In 2013, Tom moved to Boston."
Tom told Mary to help John.
Did you eat dessert?
Our budget is very limited.
Have some cake.
I broke my leg.
That was a secret.
I'm tired of losing.
Tom started to take off his jacket.
I hid myself behind the couch.
"At first, I couldn't find anything."
I don't think that they've seen us.
Yerevan is the capital of Armenia.
Call me on Monday.
My daughter's your age.
Tom is reading a book in the library.
"Who is heavier, Tom or Mary?"
I knew Tom would agree to do that.
What's going to happen?
Tom wants to buy a French-English dictionary.
Tom asked Mary where she'd put the key.
Tom had no intention of going to the dance with Mary.
Tom didn't have dinner last night.
Tom and Mary are getting married tomorrow.
Tom decided to go.
I can win.
There is no clock in my room.
I heard that he'd died.
It was not easy to convince him.
Ask Tom to call me.
Everything is OK.
Did you see it happen?
Tom tried to hide his concern.
You are the best.
Tom and I aren't fools.
I'm afraid that I still don't understand.
I wanted Tom to see me in this suit.
I wonder why is Tom doing that.
You said I was beautiful.
Is Tom coming with us?
I need money.
A dog bit Tom.
She is apparently an honest woman.
Can you tell Tom I called?
Who's going to be there?
Tom didn't like that place.
I was defending myself.
I don't have any teaching experience.
I don't like it when you swear.
Tom baked some cookies.
"Revenues are growing, but not as fast as costs."
Here you are.
Tom is a professional dancer.
What's taking so much time?
How will you stop them?
Tom didn't know what Mary was talking about.
I trusted you.
Let Tom do what he wants.
They started firing.
Can you trust them?
It wouldn't be fair to you.
Why don't you stay there?
That's quite a story.
It happened really fast.
Do not look out of the window.
Do you think plants feel pain?
Don't ever think that.
Here is a present for your birthday.
My back hurts.
I was the one who taught Tom to read.
I feel a lot better.
We'll miss Tom.
Tom works in a coffee shop.
Tom had no one to turn to for advice.
Tom ran a red light.
Did you know there were a few foxes living on this mountain?
Tom is shorter than Mary.
Tom showed Mary the photo.
There is an apple under the desk.
She must be forty or so.
I've always hated you.
Everything was better in the past.
What do you know about climate change?
Everyone said no.
Are you still living here?
Tom said he didn't want me to tell Mary what had happened.
Are you seeing anybody?
Tom doesn't seem to understand what's happening.
They were trying to kill Tom.
I was drinking tea all morning.
I found the problem easier than I had expected.
"After lunch today, our plan is to take a walk in the park."
Why don't you trust Tom?
Do you have any employees who speak French?
Please send me money.
Tom is speaking French.
I don't think you want that.
"I tried to eat it, but I couldn't."
I need to ask you a silly question.
The two of them grew up in Boston.
We met on October 20th last year.
He has strange ideas.
You can't do this.
I must finish it before I go out.
Is this your cat?
I couldn't keep up with Tom.
Is he still interested?
"My curtains were closed, so I didn't see what was happening outside."
It is warm there all the year round.
Who do you think made that mistake?
You look sad today.
"Tom, I need to tell you something."
I want them to meet you.
I told Tom to come here tomorrow at 2:30.
"Tom didn't want to disturb Mary so late at night, but it was an emergency."
Your jacket and tie don't go together.
Tell me what happened.
He laid his head on the pillow.
Tom watched the 6 o'clock news.
Can you tell me what happened to Tom?
My daughter likes to play with dolls.
I think we're even now.
Tom didn't answer the phone.
We were joking.
You don't seem very pleased.
I just found it.
Your opinion matters.
Have you ever seen a real lion?
Who should I inform?
Is that your shirt?
Tom gave the report in person.
What do you and Tom usually talk about?
"You'll find a solution, I'm sure."
"In my place, Tom would've done the same."
Put your glasses on.
My palms are damp.
Tom didn't want to do it alone.
Tom told Mary that he had seen John in January.
I met Tom this morning.
Tom wanted Mary to take out the garbage.
Is the lecture already finished?
I no longer need it.
They're slowing down.
Tom doesn't know Mary did that.
I made you some cupcakes.
Boxes were everywhere.
I got here first.
She lives a solitary life in a remote part of Scotland.
Have you been there yet?
It is half past midnight.
Don't put anything in the bag.
Do you know whether or not Tom will be at the meeting?
Tom is trying to wake Mary up.
Tom came into the room a few minutes after Mary.
This has to wait until tomorrow.
Tom checked the oil level.
I needed money.
Leave me alone now.
Don't tell me you didn't hear that.
Don't help me. I want to do this by myself.
I only have three options.
How long did it take him to write this novel?
I'd like a ticket to Boston.
I'm tired of talking to you about this.
You didn't have to leave.
Cats are nocturnal animals.
Chinese characters are very beautiful.
"Scary, isn't it?"
Tom tried to concentrate on his work.
I gave up on the idea of buying a house.
There's something I've got to do.
Don't be like that.
I received a Christmas card from my brother in Italy.
I didn't want to humiliate Tom.
I hope you get a good rest.
I'm not doing anything right now.
This is why I came here.
America is beautiful.
The women whose daughter you spoke to doesn't live here.
I've already told Tom that I don't want to do that.
That doesn't happen.
Both Tom and Mary were quiet.
Is there regular bus service to the town?
You have to eat regularly.
I thought that you said you were from Australia.
What do you want to tell us?
Do they love each other?
Have any of your friends ever been to Australia?
Tom didn't tell anyone who he really was.
You don't seem to be very tired.
Did you see Tom this morning?
I'll prove it to you.
I don't think that I would enjoy doing that.
"As soon as the new teacher entered the classroom, the students began to applaud."
What's your explanation?
Do you have any idea what just happened?
Tom thinks he's going to die soon.
I asked Tom if he needed more time.
"I was very, very lucky."
I think most of them took part in the plot.
Have you written your will?
Everyone's thirsty.
Sorry I didn't reply sooner.
You don't have to lie.
Tom gave us a vague answer.
"In case of fire, break this window."
I'm afraid I caught a cold.
Tom had a strange dream.
She praised him for his honesty.
My stomach hurts after meals.
A plane crashed into a mountain.
He's stupid.
I'm still hungry.
Why did you buy this car?
Where are your children?
How did we get into this situation?
I hated history class.
What took so long?
We know who you are.
I regret nothing.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about that.
Tom got scared.
Tom chopped firewood all afternoon.
I want to speak with you.
The electricity came on again in a few minutes.
I've always wanted to learn French.
Tom won't be obedient.
What are we going to do with that?
We were on the point of leaving when Tom arrived.
Tom isn't very clever.
It isn't your decision.
Have a good summer.
Pick it up.
We're trying to help you.
I have the day off.
Tom hasn't complained about anything yet.
I have doubts about his success.
Tom has a good chance of winning.
Do you know what day it is today?
Your question is very hard to answer.
You look good.
I believe that you'll succeed.
I was just daydreaming.
You have to stop worrying.
You can't win.
Tom co-wrote these songs.
Can I go next?
Do you have a problem with it?
I promise I won't tell anyone who you are.
I'm listening to you.
I'm accustomed to staying up late.
The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
Tom refused tell the police officer his name.
You know Tom likes baseball.
The sun seemed to stand still.
I'm very busy.
We're very close.
I wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed your party.
Tom didn't have to go to work today.
Is it true what they're saying about Tom?
I wonder if anybody can help us.
It's hard to say what the weather will be like tomorrow.
That's a secret.
What do you want to do after lunch?
Tom told everybody what was on his mind.
The girl had a telescope in her hand.
This needs to be nipped in the bud.
Please turn it on.
Tom kept to himself.
Tom is looking at us.
I'm going to eat now.
I fear for Tom's safety.
I'm defenseless.
I'll tell you why I don't like Tom.
Tom spent some time in Boston.
I am ashamed of my poor English.
Are you going to give Tom anything for Christmas?
Could you please give me back my key?
I've already tried that once.
His girlfriend is Japanese.
Tom said he found his keys.
Can we be friends now?
I used to go skiing in the winter.
Here's the real problem.
You never told me you were married.
Tom's lucky.
Just go talk to Tom.
Are you really that naive?
"He has almost no money, but he gets by."
Who are you texting?
Let's discuss that problem later.
I don't think I have the time to help you today.
We don't want to keep Tom waiting.
"This is good, isn't it?"
The vote took place on May sixteenth.
Does Tom live in Boston?
I couldn't tell Tom the truth.
Remember this rule.
Have you gone completely insane?
How many passengers are there?
Can I do something to help you?
Tom asked Mary to do something for him.
Tom asked Mary to show him how to do that.
"Once upon a time, there lived a poor man and a rich woman."
How long did it take you to write this book?
I'm glad you're here with me.
I did none of those things.
I'm going to vote for you.
I still haven't decided where to go.
Do you really think it's possible?
"You haven't seen Tom today, have you?"
I addressed the letter to my aunt.
Tom is having lunch.
Tom is cynical.
I'll do this.
Have you told Tom that his dog died?
I'm addicted to nicotine.
No one noticed that you weren't there.
Why did I ever marry you?
Does your website make you money?
Tom has no secrets from me.
Tom can't back down now.
Who made you so happy?
Tom and I need this.
He got what he deserved.
I tried doing that yesterday.
I must have lost it.
You should do that now.
You can't replace someone like Tom.
Did you have time to write it down?
May I go out for a walk?
We're trying to keep up with the times.
The problem has to be taken care of.
Tom has been alone far too long.
Tom usually wears a tie at work.
You scared us.
Can I use your dictionary?
The runners poured water over their heads.
Why did you say that to Tom?
"If you could loan me some money, I'd be grateful."
Tom died after his car hit a tree.
I don't mix business with pleasure.
Did you know that Tom and Mary were dating?
How much more time do you think this will take?
I don't believe they understood.
His life has completely changed when he married her.
Maybe we should go to Boston next summer.
Give me more money.
Corruption was a problem.
My eyes feel gritty.
I can't believe this is actually happening.
It was broken.
Do you have a lot to do?
The lions roared in their cages.
We talked until two.
Are you busy today?
I wouldn't worry about this.
Tom and Mary eventually broke up.
Can you remove it?
Haven't you washed the dishes yet?
Have you ever thought about writing a book?
She ignored him all day.
He is the fastest runner in his class.
Tom talks about his ex-wife a lot.
Tell Tom to call me.
I've done that a lot.
Tom and Mary are crying.
It's time to leave.
"Can I have some water, please?"
Finding Tom isn't going to be easy.
Are you ready to order?
She was absent due to a cold.
It's time we left.
I don't want an apology. I want an explanation.
How old is this church?
I went with Tom yesterday.
Greed makes people do strange things.
Nobody will ever replace you.
I was petrified.
Tom is short for Thomas.
I can get someone to cover for me.
I think Tom looked better before he shaved his beard off.
I've got to meet Tom.
The wheat is ready for harvest.
Tom will be so happy to see you.
Tom never said where he'd first met Mary.
We know Tom doesn't want to do that.
"He is poor, but honest."
You'll be in charge of the women working in this factory.
I hope Tom wins on Monday.
Tom kicked the ball.
Tom said that you stole my money.
There are no grammatical mistakes in this sentence.
We saw a strange object in the sky.
Use your fist.
Tom will come by taxi.
I can't wait to meet you.
Did you ask your mother?
"Tom once ate at an cheap restaurant and got food poisoning, so now he is very careful about where he eats."
What's your cat's name?
You were my inspiration.
Did you get good marks?
He left the room without saying a word.
Didn't you know Tom liked Mary?
I like country music.
Will you do it for me?
What beautiful flowers!
"Of course, I saw Tom."
Japan trades with lots of countries in the world.
Give me the most expensive one.
I have trouble sleeping.
Some topics are timeless.
Thanks for keeping us informed.
I thought that I understood you.
You're out of touch with reality.
Get out of here.
I sighed.
Tom made tea for me.
Let's go to Tom's place.
I went into Tom's room.
Tom said he didn't feel like going.
There's no point in denying that happened.
Will you tell Tom?
Tom brought some toys for the children.
Let's go.
Are you trying to impress me?
Tom must be on cloud nine.
The Mona Lisa was painted by Leonardo da Vinci.
I thought you were going to be gone all day.
Do you have any plans for next Monday?
Don't you think it's a little too big?
Tom put on his glasses.
Tell her that I am reading the newspaper.
Do you live near here?
How many people live in Australia?
Were you the one who told Tom that he shouldn't go?
Tom looks like he always does.
He became a nice young man.
It seems to me that this is too expensive.
I hid it somewhere.
"Without your help, I couldn't have gotten over that difficult situation."
Tom couldn't decide what to buy.
We respect Tom.
"I'm very concerned about you, Tom."
That will please my father.
Tom asked Mary what her plans for the future were.
"I am not sure, but I think I want to be a teacher."
I thought that you knew that.
I wish to talk to your daughter.
Cholera is uncommon in Japan.
She received the electricity bill today.
Your vote matters.
He was seen crossing the street.
I can't play tennis that well.
We hope that you'll succeed.
Have you gone nuts?
Tom will be here till 2:30.
I know I should've left earlier.
"The surgery, performed at our clinic, is over in half an hour."
She advised him to stay in bed for two more days.
I don't understand what you want to do.
I told you we'd make a good team.
This bird can fly.
Do you want to buy it?
Which one is cheaper?
How long have you been a teacher?
Is there any way we can help you?
We're surrounded.
This is the most beautiful sunset that I have ever seen.
Tom will be back in an hour.
The road is under construction.
Are you going to eat that?
They're as tired as we are.
"Not knowing what to say, he remained silent."
Where did everyone go?
I had hoped we might become friends.
You've found it.
How could you know?
Tom said it can be repaired.
He made up his mind not to return to his native country.
That island has a tropical climate.
He doesn't know what it is to be poor.
I've never seen that before in my life.
Tom ignored me.
It's Monday today and it will be Tuesday tomorrow.
Dogs like playing with other dogs.
Tom obviously knows that Mary likes him.
Sacramento is the capital of California.
What's in it for me?
I did that while you were still asleep.
I know that some people appreciate my work.
He visited his hometown for the first time in ten years.
I'm as old as he is.
Don't forget to turn off the TV before you go to sleep.
I can't wait to tell you about my trip.
I think we can do this by ourselves.
He couldn't bring himself to believe her story.
Can you explain why you don't like Tom?
It looks like they're satisfied with the result.
How did you do that so quickly?
You've been had.
Oranges have a lot of vitamins.
I don't want to study French.
Will I have time to do that today?
Tom said he was going to kiss Mary.
Tom didn't want to read a book.
Tom said that he was worried about his future.
I will tell you the rest tomorrow.
Tom had no idea who you were.
I should've brought my camera.
She met him three years ago.
Do you think French is difficult?
I don't think Tom is going to Boston.
Is there enough food for everyone?
I told you we'd make a good team.
Seize him!
I don't think that this is enough.
You're not dying.
This is it.
Are you sure you don't want me to stay?
Tom and Mary are still in Boston.
Tom thinks that Mary can't understand French.
Do you have a backup plan?
We will be together forever.
I was trying to talk to you.
Tom wanted to be like his father.
Don't call me that.
It's almost impossible.
I think you like me.
We must not allow this.
Tom speaks French much better than Mary does.
Have you finished your French homework yet?
"You heard them, didn't you?"
I want that one.
You're the only one who knows how to do this.
It was Tom who told me you were sick.
I didn't know that Tom was married.
I won't allow you to do that.
Tom wanted to help Mary out.
I went to your website.
I think it's a very interesting question.
I hope Tom goes home.
I usually read the newspaper during my lunch hour.
We love our school.
I've already read it.
The boat is on fire.
I'll be in Boston all summer.
You may sit down on the chair.
A drowning man will clutch at a straw.
I don't think anyone will like Tom.
You lied to me.
I'm very happy with the result.
I just wanted to make sure I wasn't wrong.
They want to do this right.
You can't leave us here.
You'd better not sing that song tonight.
Tom wanted us to talk to you.
Call the police.
Tom felt a tad awkward around Mary.
Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow.
Tom told me you liked going to concerts.
Earthworms are a gardener's best friends.
Don't smoke too much.
I am visiting my friends.
Tom is wearing flip-flops.
Mother gets up earliest in my family.
The streets are clean.
Tom walked past Mary without saying anything.
I'm not sure I'm ready to do this.
One of my suitcases is missing.
I've never trusted you and I never will.
"From my house, it's three miles to the nearest bus stop."
Tom and Mary are deeply in love with each other.
"You're quite right, Tom."
You should apologize to her.
The noise doesn't bother us.
Did you find your letters?
Why are you so smart?
They're average students.
Somebody tried to kill you.
I'd like to order a pizza.
Go sit down.
I'd do this again if I had the chance to.
Tom is smaller than me.
You can't use this.
Do these cookies have nuts in them?
You're finicky.
He's not in yet.
Don't forget to spend a little time looking over your notes before the exam.
Are there many people in Europe who believe in ghosts even now?
I felt like an idiot.
There are a lot of fish in the pond.
Are they hiding something?
Not everything Tom said was true.
"You aren't Canadian, are you?"
Why didn't you wait?
You don't need to go there if you don't want to.
Tom had a choice.
I don't want to die tomorrow.
What happened today?
I'm very grateful for your help.
I'm glad that we won.
This statue is made of marble.
Tom said that he didn't want me to worry.
She read the poem aloud.
How much have we saved this month?
Tom was entranced by Mary's singing.
Why aren't you dressed?
We won't let you die.
Are you going to attend Tom and Mary's wedding?
Tom got cheated.
Tom didn't want to talk to you.
Tell Tom I'm proud of him.
I'd like to rent a car.
You never told me that before.
It's what you deserve.
Why am I so tired?
I have no idea why Tom quit his job.
I wrote the answers carefully.
"You've lost a little weight, haven't you?"
How do we know that?
She never dreamed she'd meet him overseas.
How often do you go fishing?
I haven't seen Tom for several years.
Tom admired Mary.
I don't know who Tom wants to give this bottle of wine to.
Father often helps me with my homework.
I'm very thin.
This is a hard question to answer.
It sounds dangerous.
They're not illegal.
Wake them up.
Tom didn't see it.
Tom drove to school.
My cat doesn't like to get wet.
Has anyone told Tom about what happened?
He went out in the rain.
The snow will melt when the sun comes out.
I'll miss you a lot.
Tom's wife passed away.
I don't like walking home alone after dark.
"You didn't drink that water, did you?"
My grade is above the average.
"Tom, come here and sit with me."
Tom overpowered Mary.
You tried to kill me.
What's your favorite winter sport?
I just want to sleep.
We're not dating.
When was the last time Tom was late?
The rain prevented me from coming.
Go and look for Tom.
I want to share this with you.
Tom said he didn't believe in ghosts.
I thought Tom would like Mary.
Tom is in the habit of staying up late at night.
What else do you want to do?
I'm not accusing Tom of anything.
Read it again.
You shouldn't have gone into the forest alone.
Bring him to me.
No one really knows what happened.
Tom died in a train accident.
"I'd like one stamp, please."
Did you see what just happened?
The house was surrounded by fields.
Please write down everything I say.
She was very kind to everyone.
You didn't have to stoop so low.
Isn't this what you want?
What are Australia's major imports?
I should've won.
You're so funny.
"Ambulances don't have to stop at red lights, but they usually slow down."
Do you want to talk about that?
"Yes, you're quite right."
Don't forget to turn off the gas before going out.
I've been following you.
Man is the only animal that uses fire.
Tom gave me a ride.
The sound is coming from over there.
He repeated the same mistake.
I sometimes make mistakes.
Where did you buy that?
"When you finish eating that, come back for more."
I used to be your age.
She is already married.
"You are tired, aren't you?"
"If only her husband helped her, most of her problems at home would disappear."
Are you a criminal?
I owe you a big apology.
The same holds true for Tom.
Why are you afraid to talk to the police?
What time will you come back?
Why did you paint your fence red?
I need to get to bed.
I'm thankful for your kindness.
Tom is in the army.
I'm the only one who understands you.
I thought you'd be happy.
That was a good hat.
I want you to stop looking for Tom.
Tell me the truth at once.
I'm leaving you.
Tom enjoys watching TV.
"To tell the truth, I've forgotten his name."
I wanted Tom to suffer.
"If there was no sun, we would not be able to live."
We used to work for Tom.
I should be with my family.
It'll happen again.
Can we trust them?
Tom was released from prison three months ago.
We'll expect you for dinner on Thursday.
I enjoy looking at old family pictures.
I go every year.
The dog had a piece of meat in its mouth.
Let your imagination run wild.
"Tom doesn't have to leave now, does he?"
"Tom was sick, so he didn't come."
I couldn't get my car started.
You're very imaginative.
Tom and Mary are still young.
Why are you looking at me?
Did I leave my umbrella here?
I have known Tom since I was a little boy.
I can lend you some money if you like.
Try not to cry.
Which one would you recommend?
"I wear a suit, but not a tie."
"Tom is at the bus station, waiting for Mary."
Tom didn't seem to be stoned.
Tom tried to hug Mary.
Give me a call.
You could've called me yourself.
Do you often talk to yourself?
I'm not eager to meet Tom.
I already gave it to Tom.
I don't want to tell anyone anything.
He is a medical student.
Have you spoken to Tom lately?
I've never eaten anything like this before.
I told Tom I disagreed.
I'll show you the way.
Tom is bad at doing that.
"Judging from his accent, he is from Kansai."
He is in the bathroom.
They have few books.
May I have a blanket?
Tom would've never done this.
You know very well how it happened.
It's no trouble at all.
She decided to go abroad.
I need to warn Tom that there may be a few problems.
Tom isn't too old.
I'm sure someone will do that.
I never dream. Is that normal?
I don't want to study abroad.
Tom is a very hard-working person.
What prevented you from coming yesterday?
I will do it right now.
The contract will expire soon.
I'm sure I can do what you're asking.
He told his sons to help each other after his death.
I almost never lie.
I can't stand raw fish.
I'm a dentist.
"Art is not a luxury, but a necessity."
Tom didn't believe his eyes.
He presented an argument for the war.
I didn't know that we wouldn't be allowed to do that.
That's the house where Tom was born.
What was your father's name?
Is Tom ready to go?
I'm Tom's uncle.
Tom is much more experienced than I am.
She postponed her trip to Mexico.
We're all very proud of you.
He acquired American citizenship.
Father bought me a motorcycle.
Do you want to leave now?
The wall is white on the outside and green on the inside.
Who made you so happy?
It may seem odd.
We can't do that yet.
It can be repaired.
Why is that on the floor?
Why does Tom have a gun?
It's obvious that you're no longer interested.
"Not knowing what to do, I asked the teacher for advice."
This is where Tom wants to live.
Tom doesn't want to come to Boston.
Tom said he didn't need a break.
Send me all your questions and I'll try to answer them.
I pretended to be reading.
What's Tom's blood type?
I don't think that I'll go to Boston.
I wanted to get married.
They have been here since 1989.
We are getting off at the next station.
"In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king."
Who told you I was rich?
I burned my fingers on a hot iron.
Only Tom would use the purchase of a new TV as an excuse to throw a party.
Stay here and wait for Tom.
Tom couldn't hear Mary.
I haven't done that since last year.
This doesn't work.
You just need a good rest.
Why are you so pale?
I knew Tom and Mary were married.
Try to find it.
Do you want to continue?
"It will be very, very hot."
Tom likes licorice.
Tom shot a deer.
I can't believe it myself.
You're stupid to trust Tom.
Tom was writing a novel.
Tom had lipstick all over his face.
Put this bracelet on your wrist.
His explanation doesn't make sense at all.
I think it's over.
Was anyone injured?
I did my work.
Mary said she had nothing to wear.
I'll ask you one question.
I'm not ready either.
I recommend you to go by train.
I just stopped by to say hello.
Is Tom young?
Didn't you know you were likely to be arrested?
I hate you all.
There are few alternatives.
I dislike being alone.
Why are you yelling at me?
Tom likes playing football.
I caught him cheating in the examination.
Tom didn't have to go with us.
I didn't drink the water.
I know what Tom is planning.
I'll be honest with you.
Please say something.
How many people have you killed?
I finished writing a letter in English.
Tom claims he didn't know that that was going to happen.
I was defenseless.
I paid for it.
Tom hanged himself last night.
Can you tell me what that means?
I just wanted to thank you.
It seems like a terrible waste of time.
I want you to listen to me.
Tom might get punished if he does that.
Please buy me three pens.
I think you'll enjoy this movie.
We have only three rules.
Who else knows?
You're always finding fault with me.
Tom hasn't given up yet.
I met my teacher by accident at the restaurant last night.
Tom told me he never said that.
Are you talking about me?
I'm sitting here with Tom.
I can't go to work in these clothes.
We want Tom to help Mary.
"Tom isn't your real name, is it?"
Tom hasn't yet met Mary's children.
Have you ever seen Tom without his glasses on?
I don't know much about politics.
No one's listening.
What's the matter with Tom?
This is the guitar I like the best.
You can always quit the job.
You need a miracle.
Tom said nothing had changed.
Tom isn't much of a talker.
"You were telling the truth, weren't you?"
Tom and Mary both went to the same school.
Tom fell into the pool.
You aren't expected to do that.
I ran into Tom on the bus.
It would be safer to go by train.
It'll take longer to tell you how to do it than to just go ahead and do it myself.
Tom came back three months later.
He went there to learn English.
"Stop doing that, please."
"You were watching, weren't you?"
Stop talking about the game.
Don't expect too much.
It's hard for me to understand French when it's spoken quickly.
I'm going to watch TV tonight.
She is shameless.
I made it for you. Do you like it?
Doctors don't know anything.
It's not fair at all.
I'll have to do that myself.
Does it hurt at all?
There are some pears in the box.
I almost never listen to the radio.
"Can I have the next one, please?"
There are a lot of questions I need to ask you.
What do you do in Australia?
He doesn't want to wait for you.
I think we should admit that.
Tom will be here in a minute.
Everybody will be home for Christmas.
Are you a Japanese citizen?
I hope to live in a mansion someday.
I don't have time to meet you.
She laced her shoes.
Tom wondered how many hours it took Mary to get ready for the party.
It was cruel.
Tom returned Mary's smile.
We had a fun day.
I like that idea.
Where were you? Everyone is looking for you.
I suspect that Tom is allergic to peanuts.
Winter vacation is just around the corner.
Do you remember anything Tom said?
Tom is just trying to help.
I thought Tom and Mary were married to each other.
Do you know how to fix this?
We're here to talk.
I don't know why the meeting was postponed.
Tom never told me he used to live in Boston.
We hit it off.
Tom's death came as a surprise.
I thought I heard you.
Let's get some coffee.
I'm glad to be of service.
Do you have a more detailed map?
Tom must be happy.
I saw your friend the other day.
Tom is the best drummer I know.
He has his own car.
I persuaded him into accepting the offer.
I wanted to talk to you about Tom.
Tom is always working.
What country are you a citizen of?
Please tell Tom to do that as soon as possible.
Tom wanted to see Mary again.
Tom is ignoring me.
The story ends happily.
He reminds me of somebody.
How often do you play hockey?
I wish we could ask Tom.
This is nothing.
How long has it been since you've been home?
We haven't had those kinds of problems yet.
Do you think anyone would care if we didn't do that?
I used to take a walk in the morning.
Now I'm used to it.
There are at least three Toms at this school.
Tom has already apologized for that.
It's not yours.
How often do you call Tom?
I'm not sure this is a good idea.
"Come on up, Tom."
Who does Tom remind you of?
I can't do much.
Why did you go there without me?
I opened the envelope and pulled out a letter.
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.
Do you like tea?
I will take it.
We need to know whether it's true or not.
I won't ever forgive you for what you did.
No one understands you like I do.
I thought you'd want to take a look.
Tom said that he'd go to church.
I didn't know your mother lived with you.
Who else went to Boston with Tom?
Does Tom know you're coming?
I'd love to go with you.
"I looked around, but saw nobody."
Tom is famished.
Do I look like an actor?
Who do you think can help us?
Why does Tom have to go to Boston?
Do you want me to go to Boston with you?
The only flavor ice cream that Tom eats is vanilla.
"When I was a student, I used to go to that pizza parlor."
My mother made me a cute skirt.
The man spoke in a low voice.
What time does your plane leave tomorrow?
I'd like to speak to you in private.
That's yesterday's news.
I just noticed it.
Tom climbed out of the pool.
Don't try to manipulate me.
We're all disappointed.
We know that you're sick.
You are special.
I'm glad you were able to come.
Just call me.
Tom told Mary that he wasn't hungry.
Tell Tom I want to talk to him.
She writes to me once a month.
We never killed anyone.
I don't seem to be having much luck today.
Tom fell asleep while watching TV.
Do you like historical novels?
I'd like you to join us.
"You can speak French, can't you?"
"Why are you here, Tom?"
Do you have an iron I can borrow?
When was the last time you heard French being spoken?
I can now walk without crutches.
He wanted to go to sea.
I have returned.
I left around 2:30.
Perfect!
This diamond is fake.
Please turn off the TV.
I know what Tom can do.
Where's your dictionary?
Her face was bright with happiness.
Are you sure Tom won't be here until 2:30?
The factory produces thousands of bottles every month.
"It was raining hard, but she insisted on going for a drive."
She is crying.
That's the maximum.
I stayed home yesterday.
It's hard to believe you.
Jackson lived for eight more years.
He may be there.
I'll sign the petition.
Why are you always so cynical?
Mary said she wanted to marry me.
I've already told everyone.
"Tom, you need a haircut."
Don't call the police.
I didn't have to study yesterday.
What is the total price with all taxes included?
Tom saw them.
He hoped to be a sailor.
Where do you want to live?
Don't ask him who he is.
Tom might have time to help us.
Do you like grapes?
I believe that she has never told a lie.
I thought Tom was afraid.
This was in Tom's desk.
I want to become a fireman.
You need to follow your mother's advice.
"I looked for my cup, but didn't find it."
You arrived there before they did.
May I borrow your car?
We enjoyed swimming in the river.
I'm happy with what I've seen.
Didn't you know Tom had a sports car?
Are you saying that I'm a liar?
I'd like to know more about it.
The server was down.
Send me a picture of yourself.
I'm sorry I was late this morning.
It's just a rabbit.
Do you want me to be happy?
I've lived in Australia for a few years.
Do you talk to your plants?
That's not what I was talking about.
Tom is as tall as you.
I agreed to the proposal.
I'm just feeling a little sick.
I had to go.
I thought you read my resume.
What else does Tom need to do?
Is your father's name Tom?
Tom knew that I was awake.
He really makes me angry.
Tom weighs himself every day.
I don't know when Tom came to Boston.
I'm not very organized.
I used to live there.
Tom is only three years old.
I suggest you help us.
You've made three errors.
Tom never knew Mary was rich.
Let me hold it.
Do you mind if I smoke?
He still wants to come.
Keep your money in a safe place.
There was a problem.
I knew you wouldn't be busy.
"I wish I could help you today, but I can't."
I smell trouble.
Let us know whether you can come.
I'm glad that you were able to do that.
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
Only teenagers can do that.
Do you want me to leave the light on?
Why is everyone acting like this is such a big deal?
We can't just fire Tom.
I'm happy to help in any way I can.
"We've finished the work, so we may as well go home."
It's a well-known fact that spiders aren't insects.
I'm not finished talking to you.
You can depend on me.
You should've listened to me.
Do you know where Tom got this?
I won't show it to anybody else.
Tom learns French as well.
Do you think Tom and I are blind?
Do you know how to do it?
How should I know?
You know that.
Let's go back to the office.
"Tom is now in Boston, isn't he?"
You might not get another chance.
Did you see his face?
"A square is always a rectangle, but a rectangle is not always a square."
Tom doesn't know us very well.
I want to eat something different for a change.
Didn't you know that Tom was planning to go to Australia with Mary?
I won't lend Tom any money.
Tom is very worried about that.
I don't want to talk to you right now.
I bought a dictionary.
Try to convince Tom to help us.
Tom and I aren't Canadians.
These grapes don't taste good. Where did you buy them?
Are you a new student?
Tom said he wished that Mary and I wouldn't go out after dark by ourselves.
I used a computer in order to save time.
It is love that rules the world.
I'd like to order a pizza.
Tom is hiding something from us.
"Unfortunately, help came too late."
I'm going to tell you what I think.
I have a feeling I've met her somewhere before.
Please stay for a while longer.
Women throw themselves at Tom.
Will you be in Boston next week?
I thought somebody died.
You can take a taxi.
That's an excellent suggestion.
I put the plan into practice.
It'll be very difficult to do that.
I have no idea what this sentence means.
I suspected that Tom was a Canadian.
Don't deceive Tom.
You're disgusting.
That's very hard to do.
How would you feel if your wife left you?
How much chocolate did you eat?
Tom refuses to do that.
I'll tell you what to buy.
Please sit at the table.
Tom expected this to happen.
I think Tom is honest.
"If you ate fewer burgers, you'd probably be healthier."
I'd like to know where you bought that.
Tom has been acting a little strange lately.
Tom is sitting on a chair.
I'd never do anything like that.
How can I tell if a mushroom is poisonous?
He gave each of them a pencil.
My room is a pigsty.
I'll notify you when it's ready.
Don't you think I know?
That's a horse of a different color.
Tom's parents didn't attend his wedding.
The road is in a deplorable state.
I want to borrow your car for an hour.
We both like seafood.
This task is too much for him.
I want to pay for it now.
"I really, really need it."
I've told you many times.
I'm always happy.
We want you to behave yourself during meals.
Tom did a lot of stupid things when he was young.
What do you think Tom will say when he finds out about this?
Tom is dancing.
Suggestions are welcome.
He will come into a large fortune.
When are we going to do that?
Am I that scary?
"I'm scared too, so I'm not going to go."
Have you seen them?
We'll begin immediately.
Tom needed help.
I heard that happen.
I know them personally.
Tom wants you to go to Boston with him.
Please feel free to use my dictionary.
Tom lost again.
Tom will soon die.
What time did you go to sleep?
Tom couldn't see anybody.
Where did Tom get these clothes?
You know that I don't like eggs.
I watched an American drama.
Tom needs a shower.
He goes fishing every other day.
Put that back.
I think you're a lot richer than most people think you are.
What was their goal?
Is there a washing machine in her house?
Things are advancing at a snail's pace.
Aren't you afraid?
How are you doing these days?
Let's hit the road.
Tom finds it much easier to speak French than English.
Tom brushed a bit of dirt off of his hat.
Do you really think Tom can win?
I have what I need.
Tom is short.
An airplane that size can't land at this airport.
You're not paid to ask questions.
Did you complete the work?
My mother always told me I would be able do anything I wanted to do if I put my mind to it.
Mary is a wearing red sweater.
Who told you this?
Can you explain what this means?
He is tall and strong.
How much do you think Tom gets paid?
Tom is clearly lying.
Please tell Tom to wait.
I'd better do that right now.
The teacher tried to interest the students in current events.
Tom is always exaggerating.
Tom won't argue with Mary.
Tom helped us a lot.
I've only written three songs this year.
He was impatient to see his son.
Tom and I got everything we needed.
I thought it was weird.
Tom asked me to give you a message.
I've always had a sweet tooth.
Tom gave the picture to Mary.
"Will you help me? ""I'll be glad to."""
It's not likely to be hot tomorrow.
Guess who's coming for dinner.
I used to respect you.
The voyage lasted 14 months.
Don't you want to see Tom?
I told Tom not to tell you.
"If you want to go, then go."
I'm sure Tom doesn't want that.
Tom looked away.
I am familiar with this part of town.
Tom knows Mary won't be able to win.
I'm trying to find Park Street.
What's your hobby?
That doesn't solve the problem.
Would you like something to drink?
I didn't know you were still single.
It looks like Tom has already done that.
Tom didn't call for help.
You can't stop Tom.
I was wrongfully punished.
We can handle that.
Tom must be hungry.
Burglars broke into our apartment and stole my wife's fur coat.
I couldn't say no.
Ask the policeman the way.
The vase is on the table.
We won't go if it rains.
I won't obey those orders.
Who made the rules?
I thought Tom was dying.
I write letters to my friends.
Tom only had three dollars with him.
Love makes the world go round.
Was Tom annoyed?
"I've never been to Australia, but I plan to go there this summer."
I was in a coma.
Tom didn't get the joke.
You're hardworking.
When are you free?
Tom told Mary you went to Boston.
I was chosen for that.
This is the latest fashion this spring.
I had hoped to finish it yesterday.
Did Tom have any suggestions?
You said that it was urgent.
Tom gave me a dirty look.
Attack is the best form of defense.
My shoes got wet.
I just don't want to let you down.
They both got rich.
The money disappeared.
Tom ran out of gas.
How much money do you spend on food every month?
Do you want Tom to wait?
Let me give this to you before I forget.
Show me.
He thinks of nothing but making money.
Tom pretended not to hear Mary.
Everybody's waiting for you.
We spent three hours in the open air.
It was such a powerful explosion that the roof was blown off.
He exchanged his cow for two horses.
You know that's not possible.
Preheat the oven to 130 degrees.
You're too young to join the army.
We've got one left.
Both Tom and Mary know that isn't likely to happen.
You're going to break it if you're not careful.
You're so funny.
I've already told Tom he doesn't need to do that.
I lost my temper.
I forgot my credit card at home.
How many hours a day does Tom swim?
What are you so upset about?
It's a long story.
He was made to do so.
That flower has a strong smell.
Do you have any cheaper seats?
I don't think I can answer that.
Do you recognize them?
The police recovered Tom's stolen wallet.
I never had a room of my own.
I need a partner.
She asked me how many languages I spoke.
Tom spoke eloquently.
"I went to bed, but I couldn't fall asleep."
Was it your idea?
You are as white as a sheet.
I know you don't like Boston.
We do not know her.
It was my last chance.
I knew you wouldn't understand.
I think it's time for me to buy a new car.
Don't give anyone else this number.
I'll go myself.
Tom would probably choose this one.
Tom should've discussed that with you.
It tastes really good.
"Hey, where are you?"
The cold air revived Tom.
"You're impressed, aren't you?"
I don't know anything about you.
Tom will go to Boston with me.
You don't need to wait for me.
I want to give up.
It took Tom a long time to get over Mary's death.
How many pairs of socks did you buy?
The kids are finally asleep.
Tom was puzzled.
Be patient.
Tom helped Mary with her homework.
"If it rains tomorrow, she will not come here."
He walks in the park every morning.
You're fired.
I don't think it's wrong.
Tom has three cows.
She wore a red blouse.
Tell me what's wrong with Tom.
He still lives with his parents.
Are you illiterate?
I think I found what you're looking for.
I was wondering when you'd get back.
Tom looks young.
Tom wadded up the piece of paper.
Did he show you the picture?
The shop is closed on Sunday.
The answer was right in front of me.
It was Tom who stole Mary's bike.
I want you to come back with me.
The school rules require students to wear school uniforms.
Who did they speak with?
Are you sure Tom did that?
They stayed away from the place.
I won the lottery.
Who's helping you?
Who is Tom to you?
Do you have a twin sister?
A police officer told me to stop the car.
Familiarity breeds contempt and children.
Give me some milk.
Tom wanted to speak with Mary.
You must be mentally exhausted.
"You want it, don't you?"
I don't want to wait that long.
I was invited to dinner.
Tom told me that he doesn't want that.
I'll be at the hospital.
Tom's sincere.
Someone lost a wallet.
Tom stole my candy.
I would've apologized to Tom if I'd thought I needed to.
She went to see him in the hospital every day.
You already did that.
My father is usually at home on Sunday.
Tom doesn't know what to do with all his money.
Did you read the book I gave you?
Push the red button if something strange happens.
"Now, let's have a look."
Have you ever heard Tom sing?
That's all I can offer you.
We were all waiting for you.
"Tom doesn't always get up early, but he always gets up before Mary does."
All my friends like you.
Tom isn't rich.
I'll wake you up tomorrow morning.
His way of speaking offended me.
Can you help me find it?
She decided not to go.
"Open the window, please."
Tom accepted Mary's offer.
I didn't know that you wrote poems.
Tom told me that he was planning to go to Boston.
Tom doesn't know many people here.
Tom was a big man.
I took dance lessons.
Is there a letter for me?
We believed you.
Let's do that once again.
Tom is reading a book in French.
There is always something happening here.
Tom gives us money.
They were rescued by helicopter.
I can't eat all that by myself.
You know very well what Tom wants.
Tom's a likable guy.
I cooked dinner for Tom.
I'm sure Tom will be here soon.
Stop laughing.
Tom's dog's name is Cookie.
This is a mystery to us.
I was just passing by.
The war ended about three months later.
Tom almost never lies to Mary.
Pitch the ball.
You simply don't understand.
Tom is going to go to Boston.
"I told you it wouldn't work, didn't I?"
This knife is dull.
What else did Tom say about me?
This county is poor in natural resources.
You need a new girlfriend.
I've done everything that Tom told me to do.
I'm glad to hear Tom didn't win.
How will you stop me?
Ignorance is no excuse.
It's their problem.
This is a video that Tom sent me.
Tom broke both his legs.
How many seconds did it take you to do that?
The police are watching us from across the street.
Tom would've liked what you said.
We learned a lot of things.
I wanna quit my job.
Tom put on his new suit.
I had no idea that it was so urgent.
Turn off the TV.
Tom is worried.
Tom refused to talk to me.
We don't even know what we're fighting for.
We visited Boston and Chicago.
We put the books on the table.
"You've seen this before, I can tell."
My heart's aching.
Speak for yourself.
I want to know everything.
Tom has Monday off.
Don't come so early next time.
What made you come here?
I'd like an explanation.
This isn't enough.
Tom vanished under mysterious circumstances.
That dog is so stupid.
I'll go by plane.
I had to run to the station.
You'd better find Tom.
What time do you usually bathe the baby?
We didn't reach the summit.
No cash was taken.
Tom asked the stranger who he was.
Tom had not been expecting this.
I'm happy for you both.
Did you ask Tom if he wants to go with us?
He's a teetotaller.
They need a doctor.
I knew you would understand.
Potatoes are vegetables.
What do you usually do in your free time?
Tom had already left.
A strange incident happened during his speech.
Our climate is changing.
Do you like this?
Tom isn't the traitor.
That's all I've got.
I've already reminded Tom to do that.
The consequence of a wrong translation can sometimes be catastrophic.
She heard him sing.
I don't think Tom will want to go to Boston with you.
Tom wanted Mary to do that yesterday.
I cooked this especially for you.
It was a good buy.
I'm hungry because I didn't eat breakfast.
It is said that prices are going to rise again.
I don't think Tom has very many friends.
Anybody home?
Tom listened patiently.
Please come next Friday.
Have you ordered the feed for the chickens?
I'll do something.
Tom has an eye for modern art.
This room is pleasant to work in.
Have you already started learning French?
You opened the wrong box.
Why didn't you go?
What time will you get to the station?
Tom can't help.
Tom doesn't have the qualities of a good leader.
I have a package here for you.
The United States was once part of the British Empire.
Thousands were killed or wounded.
There is a white dove on the roof.
I don't think I can do everything by myself.
I want you to know that I'll always love you.
They all look the same.
He went together with her.
Did Tom have a gun?
Why are you afraid to talk to the police?
Go now.
"To tell the truth, I don't really care."
Tom wants us to help him do that.
You're doing everything wrong.
The bar where Tom works lost its license because they had been selling alcoholic drinks to minors.
Tom thinks Mary will never come back.
It was published in 1969.
They're all hungry.
I didn't know you'd be jealous.
I share a room with Tom.
Tom is an important person.
We assume that he is honest.
Didn't you know what to do?
I'm taking it to Tom.
It was apparent to everybody that our team was stronger.
Has Tom been injured?
It only weighs 3 kilograms.
The commander refused to negotiate.
She has platinum blonde hair.
I got up early this morning.
I've worked extremely hard.
I can't work for this company anymore.
I've quit doing that.
I don't know what I believe.
I won't need these.
I own some property in Australia.
Do you know why no one trusts Tom?
Tom is eating breakfast with his family.
They are the only people who know the fact.
Tom arrived on foot.
Tom is quite shy.
Some men treat women like property.
Is there anything more I can do?
Tom wanted to continue.
He pulled the wounded soldier to the nearby bush.
I awoke from a dream.
He keeps all his savings in the bank.
This won't be easy.
Stay here. I'll be back.
Tom may win.
I can teach you how to drive.
Tom wants to see me.
Do that again.
I've always been afraid of doctors.
Tom's shirt is wrinkled.
We'd better get ready early because the train won't wait.
"I know you probably don't want to go out with me, but I'd love to go out with you."
Tom called Mary to ask if everything was OK.
Good luck with that.
Do you intend to eat all that?
She threatened him.
At least thirty students were absent.
What's wrong with them?
They're making too much noise. I can't concentrate.
Disobedience won't be tolerated.
Who went with you yesterday?
I know it won't be easy to do that.
You must be happy.
Go to bed.
"If you're tired, rest."
Tom is about to fall asleep.
I'm speechless.
She went out without saying a word.
You're safe with me.
He's studying.
Tom's success has been a source of great pride to all of us.
You never liked Tom.
There's a lot going on.
Tom just stood there watching everybody dance.
Why don't we play a game?
Tom is wearing gloves.
Why didn't Tom kiss Mary?
Which applications do you like best?
I should have worn a coat.
A fire broke out last night and three houses were burnt down.
I found out who Tom's father is.
Tom asked me if I was satisfied.
They supplied the war victims with food.
I can't stay silent on this matter.
Tom's hyperventilating.
Tom didn't even look at the letter Mary handed him.
I didn't know Tom was younger than you were.
I am a teacher of English.
There are people who don't like to go to sleep early.
The explorers discovered a skeleton in the cave.
Tom's important.
My bag is empty.
I have a flight to catch.
I was bitten by a lot of insects in the forest.
Do you have a cell phone?
"If you don't want to do it for Tom, then do it for me."
I'm exaggerating.
Can you tell me when the next bus will arrive?
What does that look like?
Tom jumped into the water without taking off his clothes.
I don't know what to do either.
You should go to the doctor.
How could Tom say no?
Tom asked Mary why she didn't do that.
Three people died.
I'm Tom's teacher.
This is my notebook.
You don't have to explain.
I don't like jazz.
Would you sing for me?
I really miss my girlfriend.
Did they have it?
Tom thought that Mary wanted him to kiss her.
Please don't put that on the table.
Tom chose Mary for the job.
I told Tom that I didn't know how to speak French.
We'll have to try something else.
"Thank you again, Tom."
I'm not lonely anymore.
Call me anytime.
Do you still want to go?
Tom said we had to keep this secret.
Tom isn't interested in art at all.
I won't go to school tomorrow.
I forced her to do my homework.
Nothing is working.
"Hold the elevator, Tom."
I don't think Tom is alone.
You're a coward!
I'm sorry that I didn't believe you.
Why don't you lie down for a while?
We've just arrived.
When did you go to sleep?
Tom says that Mary lies a lot.
My mom bought me this toy when I was eight years old.
Tell Tom to stop staring at me.
The process is very complicated.
I didn't know about you.
I want some orange juice.
We all have arrived.
I don't have any money with me.
I will side with you just this once.
Tom looks a little disappointed.
Tom has been promoted.
Let's not talk about it any more.
How did we win?
I have as much time as you do.
Let's get something to eat.
"Tom doesn't know what's going on, but he'll find out."
"If you don't know the meaning of a word, look it up in a dictionary."
"Tom was dressed, as always, in black."
I baked it for you.
Tom and I are still in Boston.
I'm not feeling very well myself.
Many students bought the book.
It was raining last night.
Tom came to my aid.
Why don't we get out of here?
Do you remember what I told you?
He hates spiders.
You know very well how it happened.
Do you like your job?
Tom asked how he could help.
"You're not ready yet, are you?"
I won't marry you.
Didn't you know Tom used to teach French in Boston?
Don't tell me anything you don't want others to know. I'm not good at keeping secrets.
We have been married for three years.
Tom doesn't want to eat at that restaurant.
They weren't much help.
I wonder if Tom will ever come home.
I am all ears.
It's in a safe place.
I have to convince people to do that.
I told Tom not to sing while he's working.
That is not how we do things here.
I hate this city.
He let us go.
Tom said so many times.
Do you resent my being here?
I told you Tom was dangerous.
Tom loved bananas.
I can't remember all their names.
Don't you think we ought to wait?
"If I had more time, I could do that."
Phoenix is the capital of Arizona.
What's in these boxes?
I had a sharp pain in my chest yesterday.
I wish I could have gone with her.
I sent you the money you asked for.
That's why we moved to Boston.
Tom grew up on a farm in Iowa.
She gave us lots to eat.
God is everywhere.
Show us what you bought.
Doesn't that go without saying?
Do you have any plans for today?
My house faces the sea.
We don't need a ladder.
Tom now works for Mary.
I wish I hadn't gone to Boston with Tom.
I thought Tom was fantastic.
I want you to answer me.
I hear you've been promoted.
You look very handsome.
I know that that's not why you're here.
You're part of the family.
How are we going to manage without Tom?
Our security cameras are fake.
Ten years have passed since he went to America.
I told Tom to quit bothering me.
The door remained closed all day.
You got what you wanted.
I still find it hard to believe.
Tom wasn't with me on that day.
You should've gone home already.
Tom worked like a maniac.
I sleep standing up.
Tom saw something red there.
Tom has a lot of weird ideas.
The vase fell to the floor and shattered.
What's Tom's problem?
"I have a sewing machine, but I rarely use it."
Our escape was nothing short of a miracle.
Tom died of asphyxiation.
It'll happen soon.
This one's free.
Try to find it.
Tom hasn't had his lunch yet.
I'm not wide awake yet.
This car has an alarm.
Aren't you from Australia as well?
I don't want to compete with anyone.
Tom told me that he loves me.
"Mary is not only beautiful, she's smart, too."
Tom looked in his briefcase.
Tell me what you think I should do.
Tom is a good lawyer.
Tom tried to do it by himself.
They didn't budge.
Tom had a hectic week.
"I noticed that, too."
I said no such thing.
She lived there about five years.
I asked Tom where he and Mary had first met each other.
I looked at Tom again.
Are you going to the movies this weekend?
You're so predictable.
I got married.
We sometimes swim in the lake.
I had no difficulty finding your house.
Tom put the bird back in the cage.
I think Tom is biased.
Tom is used to that.
Are you mentally ill?
"Wow, that's deep."
"You were alone at that time, weren't you?"
Everyone but Tom knew that Mary was in love with him.
You can sit next to me.
Why are you still unmarried?
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
I heard you were looking for a plumber.
You told me you could do it.
We're not sure Tom is coming.
I'm so ashamed of myself.
You should've called me.
I respect your decision.
I am sure that he will succeed.
I had one child.
Tom died at the age of ninety-nine.
I promised that I would return soon.
Tom will probably never forget this.
This is a story about stars.
Didn't you know Tom had a house on Park Street?
I'm not shy.
I have a slight headache now.
I made no such promise.
I couldn't get in touch with him.
That's why you got the promotion.
My shoulders hurt.
It can't be for nothing.
You're so lazy.
He lay down on the grass and went to sleep.
When can you come to my house?
His name is known to me.
Do you think that Tom and Mary are going to get back together?
Are you almost ready?
I've just become a grandfather.
We won't be late.
You can change it for another one.
Tom and Mary both have cars.
Tom didn't tell me he wanted to be a scientist.
I talked Tom into doing it for me.
"If you want a new bike, you'd better start saving up."
She arrived in a car.
How many more years do you plan to work?
That boy is Tom's son.
The airplane crashed about three kilometers from the airport.
Be very careful.
Tom went bananas.
My mother loves music.
This isn't a secret.
No one I know does that.
We've learned a lot from Tom.
We know that you're sick.
What are your plans for the weekend?
I wonder how Tom knew Mary was going to be here.
I don't want to go back alone.
Would you like to play a game?
I still have to pay my rent.
I know I can always count on you.
Tom spent the night in an old hunting shack.
Please don't follow this advice.
I worked in a restaurant.
I wasn't informed.
I am studying kanji.
How many T-shirts do you have?
It was stupid of me to believe Tom.
I expect a detailed report.
He was covered all over with paint.
I wanted to thank Tom in person.
Put your hand down.
Tom promised Mary he'd help John.
It didn't cost that much.
This coffee is too strong for me.
Tom knows that he's going to be punished.
I hope Tom's all right.
I think you'll find it.
We exchanged phone numbers.
My phone was broken.
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
I asked Tom this morning if he wanted to go jogging with me.
I'll pay you.
Tom told me that I'm last.
Life begins when we realize who we really are.
We want to meet Tom.
How long has it been since Tom left?
I told Tom to leave as soon as possible.
I have a sore throat and a fever.
Do you know how to speak French?
Does Tom really need to do that?
My brother is engaged in cancer research.
I'm so glad you like it.
She bought a shirt for him to wear to the party.
I haven't done that in years.
I am reading a book now.
"When she was reading the letter, she looked sad."
I need to see Tom immediately.
They say amniotic fluid has roughly the same composition as sea water.
I'm going to go there.
Please don't sit on that bench.
We can't help you.
You are comparing apples and oranges.
The boy reading a book is Tom.
"You're afraid that I'm right, aren't you?"
Does Tom work in Boston?
My six-month old son is teething.
That never happened before.
I thought it might be useful.
They're all liars.
It's Tom's birthday today.
Why do you think I don't like your friends?
I respect you and your opinions.
What have you told them?
Tom is hiding under the bed.
I let them go.
Tom never said that he wanted to work for you.
He is supposed to be the best doctor in the town.
"This is my book, not yours."
Where can I buy stamps?
You did a good thing.
I'm not satisfied.
They know that I talked to you.
Tom wasn't so lucky.
You've put on weight.
Some say that he was the greatest boxer who ever lived.
Everybody is supposed to wear a tie at the party.
No one would listen.
Where do I begin?
Tom obviously needed help.
Did Tom tell you who that was?
It is raining.
I like to listen to Tom's stories.
I don't want to kill you.
I figured you wouldn't want to drink coffee so late at night.
Tom and Mary are swimming now.
Tom and Mary talked all night.
Can you speak French?
Tom should know.
"The more people have, the more they want."
Dolphins don't have gills.
Tom forced himself to smile.
You'd better not go.
I heard you got married.
She froze at the sight of the bear.
I attended the seminar.
I believe that you should leave.
"Oh, by the way, I have something to tell you."
I'll keep my eyes closed.
Do you always do that?
Tom will meet you there.
You must come without fail.
We were both tired.
I knew Tom would back out.
Tom will enjoy doing that.
What happened to you last night?
We're really touched.
Which continent is the most populated one?
"Tom was your boyfriend when you were in high school, wasn't he?"
Let Tom stay home.
You must do your best.
I heard explosions.
Did anyone take my book?
The hospital food wasn't as bad as I expected it to be.
Anyone can do it.
Do you want some hot chocolate?
I'm sure they need you.
A childhood illness left her blind.
Just try to stay calm.
It's OK to cry.
Here's a new one.
It makes a big difference.
My aunt sent me a birthday present.
Tom only asked me three questions.
Tom didn't see it.
You'll get caught.
Your shirt is inside out.
It began to snow.
A rumor circulated through the city.
What time will you have to go to bed?
I will explain the situation to you later on.
Have you given Tom what he asked for?
You've never been like this before.
Tom is a very talented musician.
I learned something today.
"I'll see you soon, Tom."
You have to do that today.
Tom said that tomorrow is Monday.
My investments earn about 10 percent a year.
I don't know anything about his past.
Do you think that Tom will find us?
Tom was late for school.
Tom isn't lazy.
Tom photographed these buildings for the exhibit.
I don't have anything to wear.
Our dreams came true.
Tom and I are very different from each other.
I'm absolutely fine.
Tom is a good runner.
Stop picking on me.
He was almost asleep when he heard his name called.
That's really scary.
I didn't ask you for your opinion.
You don't need me.
Tom can't help you now.
It rained yesterday after it had been dry for a long time.
I'm not going to let Tom go to Boston by himself.
The contract lasts three years.
They don't despise you.
We can't afford to take risks like that.
Tom didn't want to leave at all.
I knew I should've married you.
"I'm planning to go, too."
That's where Tom bought it.
Aren't you going to go anywhere this summer?
I don't want to live by your rules.
You may quote me.
I don't think your plan will work.
Do you like your hot dog?
Did you get permission to do that?
I don't think that I heard you correctly.
Do you eat out often?
Who's joking?
Don't force Tom to eat.
Don't be so stingy.
Tom walked past Mary.
The soldiers were wearing steel helmets.
The football game was postponed on account of bad weather.
My country needs me.
Tom doesn't know that yet.
I don't think anybody suspected you weren't really Tom.
Lunch is included.
Tom never spoke to Mary again after that day.
Tom no longer works as a teacher.
Tom remained in Boston.
What did you buy Tom for Christmas?
I'm convinced Tom is lying.
Don't you have anything better to do with your time?
You must let me in.
Cheer up.
I've already decided.
She is down with a cold.
Grant refused to accept defeat.
We're going back to our hotel.
Why are you out here?
I'd better go talk to Tom.
His jokes made us laugh.
I'm not buying it.
Tom lied to me.
I've got a list.
Tom will tell you.
Come here and help.
You don't have to answer these questions.
Tom is a conservative.
You promised.
Will you help me with my English homework?
No suicide note was found.
Tom looked like he was offended.
Where was Tom last weekend?
I'm totally confused.
Please answer my question.
The Jacksons have three dogs and three cats.
I just want to understand what's going on.
We just rolled up our sleeves and started doing it.
There's not enough water.
You said it would rain and sure enough it did.
Many old customs are gradually dying out.
Tom said he was exhausted.
It's more than a coincidence.
There were no other customers.
Tom is looking for his wallet.
Tom and Mary were there.
We're very poor.
They're going to be here.
Tom and Mary stopped hugging.
Tom said he needed a day or two to think about it.
I'm the only one who can help you.
Tom proposed to Mary and she accepted.
She despises people who lie.
Tom didn't budge.
He's still single.
Where did he learn this?
What time do you get up?
How much cheese should I buy?
I came with my friends.
Tom usually waits for me.
"You can understand French, right?"
Tom gorges himself whenever he eats at that restaurant.
"If Tom calls, wake me up."
"You helped them, didn't you?"
"If I were you, I wouldn't worry."
Tom broke Mary's clarinet.
What really happened between you and Tom?
I passed the exam.
I want to play.
Tom won't find it easy to do that.
When was the last time you cooked a meal?
I got mad.
You're unforgettable.
I've got to figure out what I'm doing wrong.
I'm 30 now.
"If found guilty, Tom faces a life sentence."
I don't do that.
Give me my glasses.
"In my opinion, you are wrong."
Tell Tom I'm sick.
Tom's children are downstairs.
Tell Tom to stop.
There's a witness.
Use your charm.
What's your favorite book?
You're my best customer.
Is it damaged?
He painted the door blue.
Many tourists come to see the waterfall.
I'm traveling by myself.
You still have time.
I don't remember him saying that.
You shouldn't do this.
It was broken.
It's beautiful.
I'm overworked.
I can barely see it.
Did you bring this home?
Is Tom really busy?
Tom doesn't know where we are now.
I had to stay in bed all day.
Tom isn't quite himself lately.
Did you know that Tom used to live in Boston?
I've got some questions for you.
When was the last time you saw your children?
Parents are proud of their children when they do well in school.
She is the one who took care of his wound.
I knew you wouldn't want to do that.
Nobody believed you.
Perhaps it would be better if I went by myself.
The man left the restaurant without paying his bill.
I've lost patience with Tom.
I don't think that this is working.
You know that I don't have any money.
We've got to save Tom.
Now things are different.
That's a good excuse.
How could you help Tom?
Tom is never late.
"By the way, I have a boyfriend."
I think he did it.
I'll be back in a few minutes.
You're not the only Canadian here.
I will see him after I get back.
I seldom win arguments.
Tom raised his arms.
You must be hungry.
I really enjoy helping disabled people.
Tom only has faint memories of his grandfather.
Please do that tomorrow or the day after.
Tom didn't tell me Mary's secret.
Tom is the one who drew this picture.
I didn't know you were so lazy.
Why don't you want to do that?
I want to go to Mars.
Do you really think Tom is colorblind?
Everyone here likes Tom.
Tom dressed well.
Do you understand how this works?
Did you eat all your broccoli?
"During the rush hours in Tokyo, traffic is heavy."
Call me Tom.
Where does he want to go?
I was a fool.
He continued reading the book.
I know that Tom was tired.
We saw a flying saucer.
It's a pity that I have no ear for music.
Any further discussion is pointless.
Please don't forget to turn off the light before you go to bed.
Did you try to talk to Tom?
I need a computer.
I had other plans.
I can't go to lunch with you today.
I didn't even know that you had one.
What a big house you have!
I thought you'd find that interesting.
Even my mom knows.
We're going to come again.
"Lucky, aren't you?"
We'll be back next year.
All three of them were in love with the same girl.
Can his story be true?
I'll find a way to do it.
I think they do that on purpose.
Did you kill Tom?
There's no substitute for hard work.
I think that's kind of weird.
Please freeze the fish and meat.
I would like to read books on Japanese history.
You are taller than me.
I respected you.
Tom has a very nice smile.
Do you want to read?
Tom thought Mary didn't like him anymore.
I didn't know you believed in ghosts.
"First we'll eat, and then we'll go."
Who else did you see?
Isn't it beautiful?
I have to deliver this package to Tom Jackson.
I never thought I'd see you again.
Fresh food is wonderful.
My daughter will get married in June.
A policeman came up to him.
Tom opens the gate every morning at 8:00.
Why do you think that is?
Please stay for a while longer.
Thanks for helping out.
Tom is the type of a person who calls a spade a spade.
Here he is!
I like being my own boss.
She apologized to me for stepping on my foot.
Tom is still working at his computer.
Your friends are there.
How do magnets work?
She refused to speak English.
Remember to turn out the lights.
Have you ever returned home before seven?
Tom was the last one to arrive here.
I never swim by myself.
We'll do it tomorrow if you want to.
I'm going to take tomorrow off.
She doesn't wear the cheap stuff.
About what time?
I wanted to impress my friends.
I know we can do that for you.
Tom and Mary started screaming at each other.
I couldn't stop them.
I don't care what anybody says.
Everybody knows I'm a friend of Tom's.
Maybe we'd better go look for Tom.
Tom is helping Mary in the kitchen.
The gown is made of silk.
I'll look after your affairs when you are dead.
"You are tall, but he is still taller."
I don't believe Tom.
It's not just Tom's fault.
Tom wanted to hire us both.
Is this your phone?
I brought my son with me.
Tom is much better at French than me.
He committed suicide to atone for his sin.
Is that yours?
Go somewhere else. I want to be alone.
Tom fell asleep during the lecture.
Why were you looking for us?
Tom often sleeps on the couch.
That wasn't the truth.
I need a pencil sharpener.
Is it five already?
We don't want your money.
I'm much older than you are.
I'm afraid to go.
Didn't you eat lunch?
Tom is just drunk. He's not crazy.
I'm going to give it to you.
I was making a cake.
"You agree with me, don't you?"
Did you see the item in the paper about their wedding?
We'll die if we stay here.
Are you sure this is the right place?
American kitchens are much bigger than Japanese ones.
Do you still dance?
This ship was ten meters long.
Tom wants to learn how to do that.
I am off duty tomorrow.
I don't want to discuss my problems.
Didn't you know Tom isn't really from Australia?
My flight arrived at 2:30.
I actually saw a ghost.
"If I'd studied French harder when I was in school, I'd probably not be so bad at it now."
Don't forget to lock the door.
Tom told Mary that he wouldn't be at her wedding.
Tom stretched his legs.
Crime has often been related to poverty.
Don't talk to me like this.
We'll find you.
Did Tom ever ask you that?
How was your stay?
Tom and his uncle walked together in silence.
We're sorry we weren't able to help you.
We have nothing to complain about.
How much more do we need to do?
I hope you like the job.
I am the fastest runner.
We seem to like the same kind of music.
You frightened Tom.
I love the way you treat me.
"We should've listened to you, Tom."
Do you have a French dictionary?
You're overworked.
Are you handicapped?
Where were your parents?
I have the same trouble as you have.
Tom just saved my life.
They know Tom.
Tom plays piano better than he sings.
We almost missed the train.
I need to stay here tonight.
I met Tom in Boston.
Please don't scream at me.
Tom used to play poker with us.
Blondes earn 7% more than women with any other hair color.
Can you drive me to the airport?
Tom hardly ever asks for my advice.
Can you tell us where Tom is?
Tom and Mary have already left Boston.
You ought to see a dentist.
I'm glad you asked that.
Tom asked me to marry him.
I need to know if you'll be there.
I received her letter yesterday.
I met him just as he was coming out of school.
We admired the beautiful sunset.
I picked up a coin.
He teaches English.
You're sitting in Tom's chair.
"I've missed you so much, Tom."
Do you know how it works?
I told you never to call me again.
I want to apologize for everything I've done.
Tom followed after Mary.
I was so confused.
Didn't you hear a scream?
Your secretary seems to know the truth.
She looked puzzled at the abrupt question posed by a reporter.
Where did you get all this stuff?
I drove all around town looking for Tom.
See you in an hour.
Tom spit out the poison.
Tom bought a gift for his daughter.
Tom drives too fast.
Tell me if it's necessary.
We'll meet you outside.
She is not as beautiful as her older sister.
I'm very old-fashioned.
Tom hates parties.
The police arrested the man who had murdered the girl.
I'm lucky that no one saw me do that.
You deserve the best.
Who'd buy this?
Tom dismounted his motorcycle.
Please wash this shirt.
Is there an ATM around here?
I need to hire a new secretary.
See you in the morning.
I thought we had an understanding.
How would you help?
You can count on my support.
The two countries do not have diplomatic relations.
She couldn't look me straight in the face.
Can you call him?
Let's all smile.
Tom told Mary that it wasn't a good idea to have money just sitting in the bank.
We're punctual.
You really should be investing your money.
Tom is like me.
Your friend told me about it.
The medicine took effect.
I went by bus as far as London.
Tom was really drunk.
I love it when you cook for me.
I didn't want to go to your wedding.
I'd better not eat that.
I should've done this earlier.
Did you bring yours?
I need something to drink.
Didn't you know Tom was still living with his parents?
He just loves to bully people.
That's right up my alley.
"If you need my help, call me."
"Tom will keep his word, I hope."
We will be together forever.
Are you sure you don't want to live at home with your parents?
Even Tom knew it.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
I have reason to believe that you're lying.
Please shut the door behind you.
You know that's a lie.
I have three sons.
Tom said that he didn't know Mary's address.
Tom heard someone humming his favorite tune.
We're full.
"I'm sorry, but my mother is out at the moment."
Tom isn't at home. He's at work.
Are you a secretive person?
Hand me the knife.
Doing that will only make things worse.
"As far as I know, Tom hasn't done that."
I thought you went home.
She was looking at me.
He had a radio.
Everything is broken.
Did you know men can get breast cancer?
I wasn't on the bus when it crashed.
I knew you wouldn't need to do that.
You abandoned me.
I can teach you how to cook.
"You prepared for this, didn't you?"
Where are you from?
Tom thought that his leg was broken.
He invested all his capital in that business.
What time does the concert start?
Tom said that Mary is ticklish.
His conduct was admirable.
We have a lot of snow at this time of the year.
No one was excluded.
I see no reason to tell you anything.
Tom is the guy I told you about.
The view from the top of the hill was simply breathtaking.
Tom asked Mary some questions.
Quit it!
Tom was the only man in the room.
She has a son and a daughter.
I brought my son with me.
Tom often agrees with me.
Tom is not good at keeping secrets.
It wasn't easy.
Tom ate all the popcorn.
Tom only found out after his mother's death that she had gambled away his inheritance.
Give me back my money.
Please go on.
I'm three years older than you.
He's not at home.
Tom thought Mary was worried.
The planet closest to the sun is Mercury.
Are you any good at ice skating?
Tom gave me a hint.
Tom read the story out loud.
You were all a big help.
I told you that would work.
Are you sure that Tom is behind this?
We'll never see Tom again.
The girl who I thought was a singer proved to be a different person.
The street is paved with asphalt.
I'll send flowers.
I don't think that Tom heard me.
The sun has set.
What time are you meeting Tom?
Who knows what's going to happen?
That would be ideal.
"Tom didn't do it, did he?"
You'll have to use the rear door while the house is being painted.
That's nothing new.
I learned to swim on my own.
You don't know anything.
What's your boss's name?
"If you don't have a pen, it's OK to use a pencil."
Don't you hear what I'm saying?
"If you need my help, call me."
I'm wasting time.
The clock is still ticking.
"Tom waited all morning, but Mary didn't come."
I'm having a problem with my computer.
I'm unwell.
I'm not as old as Tom is.
"You were there, weren't you?"
Tom licked the honey off his fingers.
Why didn't you do what we asked you to do?
How did you know what Tom wanted?
Tom brought a blanket.
Tom is as old as Mary.
I really needed this.
You did well not to follow his advice.
I'm not going to tell Tom anything.
How can you be sure Tom will do what you ask?
That's where I can't agree with you.
Tom doesn't know when Mary left.
You can't fire us.
Tom told Mary what she had to buy.
He is anxious about his mother's health.
I like her very much.
Tom prefers blondes.
I need a volunteer to help me do that.
That's no way to speak to your parents.
Come over here and help me.
Tom won't believe Mary even if she swears it's true.
Tom used to play soccer.
This is a beautiful tree.
It's a risky operation.
It wasn't my idea.
I think we can relax now.
We didn't create the problems.
Didn't I tell you not to go there?
Tom and Mary fell in love.
We met before.
How much time do you need?
I knew Tom would eventually leave.
Please do this for me.
Do you like Italian food?
She was satisfied that he was honest.
Do you need it now?
My sister usually goes to the park every weekend.
I've always liked soccer.
Tom can never get my name right.
I knew that you'd cry.
The people rose up against the invaders.
This won't help us.
Do you still live with Tom?
Who would've thought it possible?
Is Tom behaving himself?
Can anyone drive?
Tom is not good at hiding his emotions.
I like the sound of the piano.
She bought an album for me.
Pinocchio had a long nose.
I can't say I share your enthusiasm for the idea.
How many hours ago did you do that?
She managed to drive a car.
I told Tom to take his time.
I thought you were a ghost.
"Pass me the sugar, Tom."
We need one more spoon.
I'd rather play tennis than baseball.
They appointed him chairman.
Learn these names by heart.
Japan produces a lot of good cameras.
There is almost no water in this bottle.
I can't let the matter drop.
This is a great victory.
I want to be an astronaut.
We would like to know if you can grant us a special discount.
Tom needs to go back to Boston.
Why were they chosen?
Are you single?
I wasn't expecting that at all.
She is a taxi driver.
Yesterday Tom went to Mary's house.
"This book is easy to read, since it's written in simple English."
I eat here every day.
"If I were you, I'd buy that one."
Tom slipped.
I didn't know where Tom lived.
Tom's asleep.
You are a strange person.
You knew I was married.
Stay with us for a few days.
Why did Tom ask Mary to do that?
Tom and Mary say that John cooks well.
I rode my bicycle to the store.
Tom said that you were upset.
We're not really brothers.
Carrots grow extremely well here.
They're our brothers.
I was in Tokyo yesterday.
The flame went out.
Employees are required to wear uniforms.
I'm sorry. It'll never happen again.
"If I help you, will you help me?"
Tom ironed his trousers.
Do you know how to use a dictionary?
Didn't you know Tom lived in Boston for a long time?
Tell Tom what Mary did.
I said get back!
Are you new here?
I'm not making fun of you.
Don't do anything yet.
Tom was in New York at the time.
Will you have dinner with me?
I have absolutely no clue.
I can't stand that noise.
Go to your room now!
Are you sure that Tom is in Australia now?
They lived in Australia.
Your house is big.
I think it's going to be a good year.
Tom was caught in the rain and his new suit got ruined.
Tom is abusing his authority.
Didn't you know Tom didn't like Mary?
Don't you want to study?
A pair of gloves was left in the taxi.
This building was put up in six months.
Am I going the right way?
I can't tell Tom and his younger brother apart.
I'm 100% sure of my decision.
Tom seems to want something from you.
How much are these potatoes?
It happens only once in a lifetime.
Please list your previous jobs on the application.
Ignore him.
She warned him not to go out at night alone.
Who are you protecting?
I like the color violet.
Did you see the kids?
He made up his mind to marry her.
Tom is a person I really admire.
Tom puts gas in his car twice a week.
I'll do that for you.
I really need this.
I feel in my bones that the party will be a great success.
I have a vivid imagination.
I'm sure Tom loves you.
Tom always smiles at me.
Learn these names by heart.
Aren't you going to Tom's party?
You shouldn't let Tom drive.
I have a few pens.
Tom took the bus to school.
"Take it away, please."
"I like baseball, too."
Never have I seen such a thing.
Please don't shout.
What time do you want to meet?
Tom will be greatly missed.
I will show you some pictures.
You're not that old.
That's not what Tom told us.
Tom has already apologized.
I was warned that somebody would try to kill me.
I drank a liter of coffee.
Please stay with me.
He moved to Tokyo last month.
Tom never came back.
Didn't you know that Tom and Mary often sing together?
I've wanted to meet him for a long time.
Tom stepped on the scale.
Does Tom want a car?
I'm the one who did it.
Tom asked us what we wanted.
You don't have to come here every day.
The submarine finally came to the surface.
I have two nephews.
Tom didn't want to do that anymore.
You need me more than I need you.
You must not stay in bed.
Everyone used to have one of those.
I thought you might want to talk about it.
That was a dumb question.
That's the only reason Tom is here.
The birds are singing.
Please go on.
Tom's room is very messy.
Tom was sober.
I told Tom he should go.
How does that taste?
I didn't want to look stupid.
You won't need it.
Aren't you glad to see me?
"This is Tom's shirt, not mine."
Tom said it was too early to go home.
I hope the bus comes soon.
Does Mary really love me?
It was in this box.
We can do that now.
I really need your help.
Tom called to say that he couldn't attend today's meeting.
Tom has three ex-wives.
They made me come here.
You look a little winded.
Hold the box with both hands.
It was Tom who asked Mary to do that.
I think it's time for me to write my mother another letter.
It's so sad.
I owe my success to my friend.
Is Tom officially retired?
Everything happened too fast.
Cover your eyes.
He opened the cage and set the birds free.
Why did you help Tom escape?
Tom is a tall man.
How did you come to school?
Could you call Tom?
Tom eats only white meat.
Isn't that enough for you?
Let's go to the park.
It appears the storm has calmed down.
A cat has nine lives.
I know Tom loves me.
He left his luggage at the station.
Was there anything else in the box?
I've got to stop Tom.
Why is Tom acting so stupid?
We have to make sure we get there on time.
The magic is gone.
You're taller than I am.
It's nearly midnight in Boston.
I keep thirteen cats.
Tom hasn't accused anyone of anything.
Why are you skeptical?
I asked him to wait here.
Tom wasn't arrested.
I don't think it's a bad thing.
I'd like to have a single room with a bath for two nights.
I usually go on foot.
I have to exercise.
Do you remember Tom?
I decided the same.
This is not so bad.
They have kids.
"Tom is angry at Mary, isn't he?"
It's natural for you to think so.
I've been seeking an answer to your question.
Mary has beautiful long hair.
Promise not to tell anyone.
Tom looks like he's about ready to cry.
I've been waiting for you a long time.
You won't drown if you learn how to swim.
We'll lose everything.
He spoke.
Can I do it for you?
I thought that you needed it.
I've never been late before.
I was only late by five minutes.
She owes him a lot of money.
I couldn't refuse.
That plan failed.
I like the diversity.
I fell asleep while reading.
You told me you knew how to do it.
The papers that were in the safe are gone.
Put it on.
Get out of my way.
I feel more dead than alive.
Of course you can take it if you want.
I don't remember when and where I met you.
I am sure that we will be very happy here.
We wish you a pleasant journey.
I am tired of my work.
What would you have done differently?
Tom plays the guitar almost as well as Mary.
I asked Tom not to drive too fast.
Just tell me where it is.
Where's my mom?
"If my memory serves me right, Tom and Mary got married in October of 2003."
I'm sure that that won't happen.
I think Tom was sick.
Where did you hear this?
"Clench your teeth together, please."
When do you study?
I didn't know you were so old.
I need to speak to you about something.
Does this fit?
Tom and Mary often play table tennis together.
Tom isn't sure Mary can take care of herself.
Don't ever say that.
What was Tom told?
Tom locked his sister in the closet.
I thought you'd gone to Boston.
Tom didn't have anything to do with the scandal.
Would you have dinner with me tonight?
Tom thinks he's ready.
It'll happen again if you aren't careful.
Did you climb trees when you were a child?
I apologize.
One suspect has been identified.
Do you really think I can do that?
Write your name and address.
Today is my sister's birthday.
Do you like chocolate?
Out of my way!
Tom said Mary was his assistant.
You've helped us all.
Knowledge is power.
You don't have to come.
I want a pair of gloves.
I answered the question.
You should've kept it secret.
I think Tom knew Mary.
Tom didn't need to go to work today.
Do you think I was born yesterday?
Tom made tea for me.
The bad smell sickened me.
A bird soared above.
He came down to breakfast.
The cashier bagged the customer's groceries.
It took four months to write a new Constitution.
You have to do that.
Back off.
Anybody will do.
Why did that happen?
Let's stop here and wait for Tom.
Let's draw straws.
I have no respect for Tom.
Tom should've done that long ago.
You have to believe me.
I'm free every day but Monday.
That's logical.
Could you lend me three thousand dollars?
The boy crammed all his clothes into the bag.
Tom and Mary have a nice home.
I've already written to Tom.
A French translation of this book was published in 2013.
Tom worked for Mary for many years.
He goes to bed at eight o'clock.
Do you want to hear my opinion?
You're still here.
Roosevelt spoke for almost an hour.
He had no luck in finding work.
I don't want to go.
She is buying a toy for her child.
The last one is the best.
Where can I find a hospital?
You're unimaginative.
Are you ready to go out?
You should marry someone you love.
Tom left a message for Mary.
It's not broken.
It was gambling that brought about his ruin.
No one answered the question.
I was stupid to trust you.
Tom could've heard us.
I've been on edge all day.
"If you want to keep meat for a long time, freeze it."
Tom and Mary are still crying.
You're really brave.
I see Tom quite often.
Do you have a ticket?
It's up one floor.
When did you get home?
It was a close match.
Do you really want to talk to me?
No one went near him.
You shouldn't read a book in a room this dim.
Did Tom ask about me?
I can do this all night.
My work is finished.
He's painting his house.
As soon as man is born he begins to die.
My name is Tom. What's yours?
Let's do something.
You speak French well.
Would you do it?
We need to talk to you.
I saw Tom crying.
I think my husband spends too much money.
Didn't you know there used to be a Chinese restaurant on Park Street?
Tom took his dog to the vet.
Tom wants to get Mary back.
He arrived safe and sound.
He's a man who doesn't make mistakes.
Such a thing has never happened before.
The expert appraised the watch at $200.
It's strange that nobody knows us.
Tom is arrogant.
We asked Tom about that.
Anybody want a lift?
I think I'd rather not do that.
Tom switched off his computer.
Tom didn't want to make the same mistake as Mary did.
I think you're going to find this interesting.
I have no time to explain this in detail.
Eat with us.
I'll recommend it.
I don't know anyone who can help.
You need to study more.
Everyone here likes Tom.
I couldn't do it.
Tom told me I'm first.
I'll sleep on the floor.
There was a Persian cat sleeping on the table.
It's just blood.
It was so cold that he was shivering.
Should I tell them to call you?
I think you have a fever.
I have an irregular pulse.
I wanted to say goodbye.
Tom told Mary he wanted to win.
Tom got married to a widow.
He hit me twice.
Do you wish to make any other transaction?
Suit yourself.
Please don't open this window.
This factory produces CD players.
I can't imagine life without Tom.
I'd go to Australia if I were you.
You know everyone.
They congratulated their colleague on his promotion.
Tom trusted her.
I didn't have anything else to do.
Tom thanked everyone for waiting.
She is a genius.
Tom wanted to get drunk.
I'm sorry we're late.
Tom didn't want to leave empty-handed.
He does not like us.
I must leave tomorrow morning.
Tom jumped over the hedge.
Tom thinks you did that on purpose.
How important are children to you?
It was extremely cold.
I have something I have to tell you.
Her name was Mary.
I was on patrol.
Call me.
You can call me Tom if you want.
She advised him of the date for the next meeting.
"Whatever will be, will be."
She put on dark glasses to protect her eyes from the sun.
The tea is too strong. Add some water.
Do you deny that?
We're people like everybody else.
You're not fooling anyone.
Tell Tom Mary doesn't want to go.
"I expected Tom to call, but he didn't."
Tell me more about Tom.
Are you allergic to any medicines?
You have to stay in bed.
He acted without thinking.
I missed my chance.
We're in the same boat.
Is she your only daughter?
Tom was surrounded by dolphins.
Is that your ex-wife?
Don't tell anyone I'm here.
I wasn't paying attention in class.
Have we met before?
I assume that Tom can speak French.
Tom won't buy Mary that.
I'm brave.
Are you sure you can do this by yourself?
You can't escape from me.
Tom is handcuffed.
I think you and I need to talk.
We haven't yet told Tom about what happened.
I don't think Tom knows that Mary is Canadian.
"Running as fast as she could, she still failed to catch the bus."
I forgot to buy a gift for you.
Do you believe in life after death?
You're too tense.
Why did you begin without me?
Tom is going to be a father soon.
Make a choice.
I want to take a break.
I put my helmet on.
What do you think Tom will say when he finds out about this?
I forgot Tom's address.
I found the problem was easy to fix.
She never existed.
I wish I hadn't let Tom do that.
We need proof.
Can this wait until morning?
You can eat this if you want.
Tom has been sleeping in my garage.
Tom has had three glasses of wine already.
"Tom locked one of the doors, but forgot to lock the other one."
I'm leaving.
Did I just say something stupid?
Your telephone's ringing.
Tom said that he needed to get some fresh air.
She is all right at the moment.
Tom couldn't speak much French.
He was outraged.
Didn't you know I used to be a taxi driver?
Tom and Mary walked me home.
You can watch TV after supper.
I should read more.
We should talk about this.
We need to start now.
Maybe it's better that we don't know.
I grew up near a river.
You've got a fever.
I'm sure this is just a misunderstanding.
Tom took another sip.
Tom didn't tell us what happened that night.
I think it's perfect.
I don't want to work with you.
Who is the woman dressed in pink?
Don't rock the boat.
My lunch break's almost over.
Can we keep it?
You look very sleepy.
We all have changed.
I wish Tom had come last night.
I thought that I saw a rabbit on the road.
It's hot in the kitchen.
I've been waiting for this day to come.
It is high time you went to bed.
This building belongs to my family.
Tom put the box in the car.
I was ignorant of his plan.
"Tom is sitting on the sofa, reading a magazine."
Tom was staring at Mary.
When was the last time you were on a date?
It is difficult for me to answer the question.
Tom is going to name his daughter Mary.
How could you be so irresponsible?
Get out of my kitchen.
You're a great coach.
Give my regards to your sister.
"Tom says he wants me to leave, but I don't think he really means it."
The taxi abruptly turned left.
We had no electricity when I was growing up.
I was young at the time.
I just want to see my daughter.
Tom has a boat.
"Could I have the bill, please?"
I'll get off here.
Why are you being so stubborn?
"If you are happy, I am happy."
This makes me sad.
We have to talk Tom out of doing that.
I want to see them!
There was nothing there.
Tom wasn't expecting it.
Tom says he's read all of these books.
That was all Tom said.
Tom is delighted.
I don't want you to go to Boston.
Didn't you know it was raining?
She killed time reading a magazine while she waited.
I'll get there in an hour.
Tom probably thought I was going to Boston with him next weekend.
"Within a few minutes, Tom had eaten up all the food on the table."
"I like music, especially classical music."
Did you buy this in Boston?
Tom is your friend.
I believed in myself.
Tom lost seventy pounds.
He has a nimble mind.
"You asked me to talk to Tom, remember?"
Find Tom before he tells someone.
I'll always remember Tom.
Raisins are dried grapes.
Didn't you know that Tom passed away three years ago?
Tom got mad.
Let's either play checkers or chess.
I sent a message to Tom.
"Obviously, there's to be some kind of mistake."
I don't want to tell you how I did that.
"Tom couldn't do that, so I asked Mary to."
I won't tell anyone about this.
I've never heard such a proverb.
I've been blacklisted.
I'll teach you how to write.
Turn left at the corner.
"Which do you prefer, dogs or cats?"
Do you think this is easy for me?
Tom told me that I should be more careful.
Do you want to sleep?
He made me his assistant.
Did your parents approve of your marriage?
Don't fall off!
I think we should lower the price.
I do not like music.
I've solved it.
I fell in love with him.
It is true that the earth is round.
Sheep were grazing in the meadow.
Nothing significant was found.
Who did you go with?
Do you have earrings on?
Tom is going to catch you.
What's your advice?
You told me that you'd come.
He smoked as if nothing had happened.
The ice cream is melting.
I'm resilient.
Tom seldom smiles anymore.
I didn't know you wanted to go to Boston with Tom.
Do you have a girlfriend?
It's here somewhere.
Tom told me that he got his guitar for free.
Do you really like that?
They got married six months ago.
We all hated you.
I need a smaller box.
Tom sacrificed everything for you.
I'm sure you deserved it.
I'm thinking of going abroad next year.
You need to go there today.
It was so cold that the lake froze over.
How much does a kilogram of pineapples cost?
Tom beat me at darts.
My sister is also my best friend.
Tom bought a used car last week.
Tom sighed and pulled out his wallet.
Tom likes this kind of music.
Did you hear what Tom just said?
I won't betray you.
You'll have to come with us.
Tom eats fruit.
You must not smoke while working.
It's time to begin.
Which one will you choose?
May I ask you what your weight is?
Just put it there.
Prove me wrong.
He made such a long speech that we all got bored.
He delivered a speech.
Tom told me he'd love to help.
Could you ride a bicycle when you were three years old?
His house was burnt down.
Tom asked me if I'd do that.
I don't know how I did that.
You must do it quickly.
The city hall is in the center of the city.
She has twice as many books as he has.
I listen to music.
I'm sure Tom will be disappointed.
I think we need to take a little break.
Football is the most popular sport in Brazil.
Tom knows that now.
"If you can't beat them, join them."
It's hard to believe Tom is only thirteen years old.
Do you know how beautiful you are?
Give Tom everything we've got.
We bought a couple of new chairs.
Didn't you know you needed a visa?
Tom took a sip of his margarita and smiled.
Tom is digging his own grave.
Tom kissed Mary and they hugged each other.
Why is Tom hiding from Mary?
I unfolded the map.
I promise you that it won't last long.
Tom was heartbroken when Mary told him that she was leaving him.
I want to tell you something.
Tom and Mary hit it off big time from the get-go.
I haven't been back to Boston since I graduated from high school.
Tom told his son not to speak with his mouth full.
Do you like black cats?
The explorers made their way through the jungle.
I'd like to buy it.
Tom asked a few good questions.
I always wanted to go there.
That's because they don't care.
I missed the bus.
I heard you singing.
It'll get warm soon.
Tell Tom how to do that.
I should get packed.
I'll lend you this dictionary.
Did you tell Tom what to buy?
That upset all our plans.
When was the last time you and Tom went to Boston together?
Tom told me that he was curious.
I've caught a cold.
Call a doctor.
Will you allow me to play the piano?
I'm not trying to make you feel guilty.
Were you drinking?
I got to know Tom when I was living in Boston.
I know you want to do that.
What have you eaten?
Tom and I don't live in Boston anymore.
Everybody calls him Tom.
I've already paid you.
I'm willing to spend a lot for a piano.
Why are you selling this furniture?
The police arrested the person they think killed Tom.
Tom is too tired to help you today.
This is completely different.
Tom skimmed the list.
I know your roommate.
We'll talk to Tom today.
Tom is likely to be hungry.
Where is the ladies' room?
I've finished entering the data.
Does that seem reasonable to you?
You don't look like you're having any fun.
It was clever of you to tell him that.
Tom wants to see it.
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
I'm committed.
"Leave Tom alone, please."
I'm not thirsty.
Tom speaks French and English.
Is that what Tom wanted?
Did you bring yours?
You must be thirsty.
I hope you have a great time in Boston.
Tom has the keys.
I didn't cheat.
Tom was very friendly.
"Tom kept trying to call Mary, but she never answered her phone."
Tom quickly realized that something was wrong.
I'm really ready for this.
Do you know why Tom is absent from school?
I don't think Tom has any children.
I unlocked the door.
Please be honest with yourselves.
Could you please speak a little louder?
The doctor is gentle with his patients.
"Why aren't you going? ""Because I don't want to."""

I'm not in any danger.
Didn't you like this book?
Look! She's coming!
They won't hurt you.
I said it as a joke.
Tom works too much.
Tom asked an awkward question.
I think I know what you're trying to tell Tom.
I'm sure everything will work out for you.
I didn't want to leave without saying thank you.
"Why did you do that? ""I wanted to see what would happen."""
I let him go.
Don't leave Boston yet.
Tom's parents were born outside Canada.
He is not such a stingy man as he is made out to be.
"My shoes are old, but his are new."
It was an extraordinary year.
I'll fix it by myself.
Tom said you were his friend.
We can't ask Tom to do that.
Tom poured himself a glass of vodka.
Come in and sit down.
We're lost.
I have to cook dinner today.
Don't stand up.
"Don't just whine, do something!"
Tom said that Mary would do that.
I wish I hadn't believed you.
How did you get caught?
December 24th is Christmas Eve.
I've been here for a week.
Tom put his fork down.
What a stupid joke!
What are you getting at?
Can I eat this?
Tom stayed in Boston.
No one's been here.
"I'm sorry, I don't speak French."
Don't you ever clean your room?
Tom should have married Mary.
There's nothing you can do about it.
What did you eat this evening?
We had less snow this winter than we had expected.

What did you buy it for?
What's in your closet?
This is a Japanese doll.
"If the food's cold, put it in the microwave."
Tom is rich enough to buy any car he wants.
He was jealous of their happiness.
I'm sure that was the reason.
"In fact, he is a nice fellow."

Those two are exactly alike.

This book is worthy of attention.
There is nothing I can do to change that.
Put your boots on.

How would I do that?
The bus leaves every fifteen minutes.
You're going to love Boston.
Give me three more apples.
Tom got up to help Mary.
I will stay until tomorrow.
Are you from the police?

Alcohol is a drug.
I won't let you go alone.
She recognized him immediately.
You shouldn't have let this happen.
I'm sorry you had to do that.
Tom's shoes are new.
I don't have anything for you.
That's my job.
How I've missed you!
I had a tricycle when I was a kid.
They say it's going to rain tonight.
I do this almost every day.
Tell me that was a joke!
Both Tom and I'll be busy this afternoon.
Did you see yesterday's episode?
Tom doesn't even know Mary is here.
Tom's parents are very strict.
I didn't permit Tom to do that.
I think that we've made an error.
I'd heard you'd changed.

My wife is three years younger than I am.
It's a comedy movie.

Be ready to laugh at yourself.
Be careful not to hurt yourselves.
Everyone looked at him like he was crazy.
"On election day, voters chose Nixon."
It's very boring.
I came to help.
Why are you always doing that?

Do you think Tom lied?
I don't like the idea of them going without us.
My mother cut my hair too short.
Will you give it to me?

I gave him what little money I had.
The climate is changing.
Times have certainly changed.
Have you ever had lunch at this restaurant?
I was very embarrassed.
I found it while I was cleaning up.
I wish we could ask Tom to help.
There's not even one orange on the table.
Its color is red.
"You can't open it, can you?"
Tell me how that's possible.
Why do you say that?
We have no idea where Tom is.
Why did you get divorced?
Tom warned us.
He chose to live in Tokyo instead of Osaka.

Who wants cake?
I can do that with my eyes closed.
Does he have money?
I didn't see where you put your car keys.
When do you want to go?
I don't think that you're the right person for the job.
I thought you were leaving town.
I don't understand a word you're saying.
I'm drinking milk.
It won't do any good.
We couldn't wait for Tom.
This is my wedding day.
I wonder why the bus is almost empty today.
We have three hours.

Think about your future.

Who did you want to talk to?
Where do you think they went?

Where did you get this great-looking hat?
Are you trying to ruin my life?
You can't go against the laws of nature.

Didn't you know Tom needed a visa?
Wait one second.
I don't really want to go swimming today.
I've tried that already.
We know Tom doesn't always do that.
Our boss is hard to please.
He's not going.
Tom went shopping with his girlfriend.
I unexpectedly met an old friend of mine on the bus yesterday.
You must be thirsty.
Tom asked me how much money I had with me.
You're a thief.
Tom found an old picture of his grandparents in the attic.
This movie is really interesting.
I don't think Tom knows whether it's true or not.
I want Tom to see these.
I burned all the letters that you wrote to me.
Where are you calling from?
This is the most interesting book I have ever read.
I wanted you to know I'm still your friend.
They took Tom away.
They arrived half an hour early.
Take your time with it.
Onions can be used in many dishes.
Tom opened the door to see what the weather was like.
She turned away in anger.
It's a lot of work.
The future of mankind rests in your hands.
I didn't follow my own advice.
I hate dogs.
I knew that Tom didn't like it.
Everyone at the party was drinking wine.
Who was the captain?
What Tom told you was a lie.
You're a lot smarter than Tom is.
Everybody looked disappointed.
English and German are related languages.
Is this your family?
They gave him a glass of orange juice laced with vodka.
Tom wanted to give a very special present to his girlfriend.
That doesn't seem too difficult.
Tom doesn't go to Boston anymore.
I'll leave this work to you.
Can you save a seat for me?
Tom hoped the war wouldn't last long.
We'll never let you down.
Tom didn't act alone.
He fascinated me.
I want to talk about what needs to be done.
"All of the books are good, but none as good as this one."
There's some truth to this.
Tom now knows everything.
Tell Tom to give you some scissors.
Tom meant that.
I gave Tom some food.
Are you for or against the proposal?
Tom and I were very hungry.
Tom looked in the book.
Do I need to wear a tie?
Tom doesn't know what he'll do.
Try doing that once more.
How many times have I told you not to talk to Tom?
I forgot the rules.
I got Tom to do that.
I told you not to talk to Tom.
I didn't mean to interrupt your conversation.
I had some business to take care of.
Tom has been living in Boston for a very long time.
We want you to have fun.
Tom wouldn't do that here.
I really don't want to talk about it.
I'm pretty sure Tom can swim.
It'll help you save energy.
You'd better go back to class.
"I tried calling, but they didn't answer."
When can we leave?
Why isn't it working?
Why is that significant?
What happened to the money that was in this drawer?
Let's give up.
How much time have you spent in Boston?
Tom lit the fuse.
Am I clear?
You need sleep.
Ask me something easier.
Go get Tom a blanket.
Tom died of cancer.
Doctors save lives.
Get out of our house.
Maybe all this is happening for a reason.
"This tastes pretty good, doesn't it?"
How much more time do you need?
I don't think you'll like this.
"You love that house, don't you?"
Tom's cellphone rang.
This bread is at least three weeks old.
You should go help Tom.
Did Tom work for you?
She did a good job.
I totally disagree.
I'm trying to find a job.
What did Tom go to Boston for?
I feel warmer already.
The president was forced to return to Washington.
Why do you think that Tom didn't do that?
It's difficult to speak with Tom.
I'll buy the same thing you buy.
I hope it's safe.
"It's not just illegal, it's also dangerous."
Are you a believer?
She is a second year student.
Don't stay up late tonight.
That isn't much.
No one had ever asked Tom that question before.
Do you have any other books?
Can you really predict the future?
I told you this was going to be boring.
I knew Tom wouldn't wait.
Give my thanks to your son.
I was a fool.
It started to rain as soon as we pitched the tent.
How old was Tom at that time?
You wouldn't do that.
How do you stand this humidity?
Leave me.
We both know what's out there.
Tom and I were busy.
Tom sells building materials.
You shouldn't have worried so much.
I collect dolls from different countries.
"Did you understand? ""More or less."""
I've never seen Tom so angry.
"If Shakespeare were still living, he'd be over 450 years old."
That's a lame excuse for giving up the work.
It's very likely to rain tomorrow.
It scares me.
Which one will you choose?
I've had this since I was a kid.
Is anybody there?
You're not my boss anymore.
His sister is a real beauty.
Are you full?
There's nothing worse than a long-distance relationship.
Is Tom here now?
His passport was stolen.
I often go swimming in the river.
Don't interrupt Tom.
Who made you so happy?
I forgot what I was going to say.
This beautiful dress is made of silk.
Tom told me he was an artist.
I thought that you knew that.
French is the only foreign language I've ever studied.
I've had a lot of fun.
I have seen little of him lately.
What exactly did you see?
I'm going to crash at Tom's.
Do what you believe is right.
What did you get hit with?
You don't need to apologize to Tom.
Tom didn't have to go there by himself.
I don't understand why you like Tom.
How much does your dog weigh?
Tom bought three lottery tickets.
Tom told me that he loved me.
That picture was taken by Tom.
Who'll pay the bill?
I want Tom to cook me something to eat.
They concluded that he had told a lie.
Time and tide wait for no man.
"At first, I thought she was sick."
Where are you planning to stay?
You shouldn't eat this.
It was quite simple.
I wasn't wearing a coat.
You drive.
You're too modest.
I just couldn't say no to Tom.
How did they do that?
Tell me where you were born.
Tom left for a second.
Tom has told me a lot about you.
I thought you said that Tom needed more time.
Tom phoned to say he was on his way.
The idea never came into my head.
I can't play tennis that well.
Help me learn how to drive.
There were too many of them.
The problem is whether my parents will agree or not.
I can't do anything right now.
We are grateful to you for your kindness.
Stop playing hard to get.
Isn't today your birthday?
I'll give you this camera.
No one but Tom did that.
Tom loved writing poems when he was a teenager.
There's no exit.
"You're not listening, are you?"
The proposal went through.
Tell them what you told me.
We couldn't have children.
May I borrow this dictionary?
Get a doctor.
Why are you so happy?
Don't force me to do that.
It's freezing outside.
We look up to him as our leader.
I wasn't wrong.
Everybody laughed but me.
I never want to see you again.
What do you think about astrology?
Do you know anything about Tom's childhood?
Tom is wearing the same clothes as he was yesterday.
Tom is a stranger in this town.
You've brightened my day.
Take this to Tom.
Call me immediately after you meet him.
Tom told the truth.
You won't feel a thing.
I shivered.
They're still available.
Tom is going to be there next week.
Ask her if she'll sew up the hole in your jeans.
Tom waited for Mary to call.
I need those documents.
Tom and Mary are teachers.
Tell me about what happened in Boston.
What do you think we need?
Tom went back upstairs.
"Tom is good, but Mary is better."
Is this your office?
I have to buy a new scanner.
"Obviously, you don't understand."
I'm a lot more comfortable now.
Couldn't you do that later?
I thought you'd be thirsty.
I can do more than just cook.
I just finished painting the house.
What makes you think that'll work?
Tom didn't need money.
I'll never learn.
My house is very old.
You're out of sugar.
Let me help you.
This really isn't a good time.
He built himself a house.
Tom speaks very good French.
I want to be an actress.
I need a pen.
This will be on the test.
Why is that ridiculous?
I didn't know that you were so unhappy here.
Tom said he didn't know anybody here.
I came here a lot when I was a kid.
I'm living in Boston.
The last one is the best.
We'll do everything we can to find Tom.
I may still win.
How much do you usually drink?
Can't you eat with us?
Tom and Mary hid their relationship from their parents.
Never do anything just to show you can.
I'm going to Boston in October.
Why are you so sad?
Why was I never told about this?
Please don't tell Tom anything.
I know that Tom is lucky.
I didn't know you were so lazy.
Did you have dreams?
Who says Tom knew?
He has a dog.
I've told Tom where Mary is.
I don't drink beer.
He barely escaped death.
Thank you for everything.
This medicine tastes horrible.
Tom bought them for me.
I knew they would suspect you.
Bring along your friend.
I play tennis every day.
"As a boy, I used to lie on my back on the grass and look at white clouds."
Tom laughed at me.
She took something out of the bag.
Tom invited me to his birthday party.
You're too polite.
Turn down the television.
Not all swans are white.
What should I feed my dog?
Everyone says that he's a good man.
We'll hurry.
Tom bought a present for his son.
How long does it take from here to your house?
I have a hunch.
I paid Tom for the work he did.
Tom bought some vegetables and fruit.
We're leaving.
I asked Tom if he liked Chinese food.
That wasn't what I expected.
Tom wanted Mary and John to go to Boston with him.
All the hotels in town are full.
Tom turned right.
The coat is lined with fur.
That never crossed my mind.
I hate coffee.
How is that my fault?
Tom was re-elected mayor.
I knew Tom didn't like it.
Let's all stand.
"Even though he was sick, the boy still went to school."
I've messed up.
I'll get in touch with you as soon as I arrive.
Don't get mad at Tom.
Why should Tom apologize to you?
Tom doesn't do that kind of thing.
Tom felt insignificant when he looked up at the night sky.
Tom showed Mary around.
Why did you go there without me?
Tom and I didn't do that.
His smile put her at ease.
You shouldn't stay up so late at night.
And now we have a problem.
Give me a red pencil.
I shop here all the time.
Do you think we can solve this problem without Tom's help?
Thirteen people died in the train wreck.
We voted for Tom.
Don't be so careless!
Tom fell down and wasn't able to get up.
Tom eats too fast.
You play games too much.
A friend told me that story.
I'm sure Tom doesn't want to be here.
"Which is cheaper, this or that?"
You've got to tell somebody.
"A group of foreigners arrived in Edo, in other words Tokyo."
Tom was aware of the difficulties.
I was sure of it.
Wash your feet.
"”Is it OK to smoke here?"" ""Yes, it is."""
I'll show you the way out.
I like to read.
Mary doesn't look like her mother.
I don't think that I'm wrong.
I couldn't find it anywhere.
Can I count on your help?
All of us went except for Tom.
Stars are shining in the sky.
I think I'm going to be fired.
He moved close to her.
Do it gently.
No one will help us.
I don't seem to be myself these days.
She described him as handsome.
This isn't complicated.
Buy me some candy.
It's very sensitive.
Tom bought a gift for his daughter.
There were too many people at the concert.
I can't be in two places at the same time.
Need a lift?
I want to see my parents.
You have to buy one at the office.
This country is rich in oil.
Come over any time.
Does anyone need a lift home?
Let's not talk about this anymore.
Tom plays tennis well.
I've got some information for Tom.
Have you washed the dishes?
Don't forget your bag.
Why did you buy all this stuff?
I've told you what you must do.
Tom became very fat.
I think I'm ready.
How much money do you think that Tom has stolen?
They're too big.
I'm glad you are happy with your job.
I'm going back to look for Tom.
Tom hopes Mary won't cry.
You know it as well as I do.
We're here to support you.
I'm going to get you home.
Tom is average height.
Tom said it cost too much.
I'll call you in about an hour.
"If you ask me, this is a complete waste of time."
There's no other damage.
Perhaps we'll have better luck tomorrow.
I know your mom doesn't want you to talk to me.
Do you believe Judas betrayed Jesus Christ?
What have you found out?
You're winning.
A girl opened the door in answer to my knock.
Tom unlocked the door and went inside.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
Don't kiss me.
Pasta is high in carbohydrates.
Tom will definitely come.
I'll call you if anything happens.
Tom won the competition.
Tom didn't like it at all.
How is that different from what I just said?
It's Tom that I want to talk to.
I came by bus.
I don't have any pens.
Tom Jackson is the richest man in Boston.
I like reading.
America's war with Spain was over.
I've already promised Tom I'd help him.
"God, you're beautiful."
Tom thinks he's better than anyone else.
Do you want to sit next to the window?
I left it at school.
Tom and Mary really hate each other.
Let's throw a bachelor party for Tom.
You can try.
Please pass the salt.
You're vain.
I'm really glad you decided to come.
Tom slept on the plane.
Tom forgot his glasses.
Tom wrote a note to Mary.
This is a good house.
"Of course, I told Tom."
I worked hard day after day.
When did you buy it?
I no longer believe it.
Our car was a total loss after the accident.
Mary has hair down to her waist.
I asked Tom the same question.
Is that hard to do?
Come along with me.
I have a brain tumor.
How do you like the weather here?
You'll never be alone.
Tom asked Mary where she worked.
Tom told me he was irritated.
Could you please speak a little louder?
You remind me of your brother.
Tom wasn't talking to anybody.
Those are my parents.
What time is Tom picking you up?
I have a cough.
I'll do that tomorrow.
What kind of tree is this?
I haven't seen that movie yet.
This is the doghouse that I made myself.
Tom switched on the microphone.
It was chilly that day.
I know a place we can go.
Mary felt like Tom was undressing her with his eyes.
Who are we?
It was cold.
Tom asks too many questions.
I thought you said you wanted to go to Boston.
"The moment she was alone, she opened the letter."
Tom was a nice man.
I've never seen you like this before.
Have you been drinking today?
Tom mispronounces many words.
I'm afraid of being laughed at.
Tom and I met at a party.
I need to go home a little early today.
I'll sign it.
"The train was late, but I still got to work on time."
Bring him to me.
I understand that it's not fair.
Tom has been in jail several times.
Tom said that he didn't like doing that.
Is that why you came?
Tom won't eat meat.
I think Tom is jealous.
"To make matters worse, he fell ill."
I thought you'd be here by 2:30.
That is the worst thing you can do!
Excuse me for being dressed like this.
Please stay with us.
They took a walk.
I have a nice present to give you.
Stay out of here.
Do you want to have breakfast with me?
Everybody wants to sit beside her.
Tom needed it.
We have run short of food.
Are you saying you love me?
We don't need anyone else.
How much are you being paid to do this?
Tom will turn thirty on October twentieth.
This is the hotel where Tom usually stays.
Give me the big knife to cut the bread.
That could only happen if they were still in the country.
Don't worry about it. It's not your problem.
Tom and Mary invited us to spend the weekend with them.
Tom said Mary was in Boston.
They need to get up early.
I won't show it to anyone else.
"It's wrong to deceive people, but worse to deceive yourself."
Did Tom promise you he'd do that?
Are you going to eat this?
It seems to me that you're wrong.
I don't think that Tom knows I'm Canadian.
Just keep talking.
Are you sure you're ready?
The crowd is growing larger and larger.
I'll warn you.
You can use mine.
Tom wanted to talk with Mary.
The loss amounted to 100 dollars.
Tom wants to be a success.
What is the maximum dosage for an adult?
I didn't know what I'd done was against the rules.
Her hair is turning gray.
Tom was not the man of my dreams.
What kinds of exercises do you do?
How can we do that?
I should start doing yoga.
"What do you do, exactly?"
I don't think Tom is worried.
The workers were naked to the waist.
It isn't safe to drink this water.
Germany and Japan were defeated.
What are you working on now?
Science begins when you ask why and how.
I told them to stop.
Tom claimed that Mary shot him.
I know it was partly my fault.
Look under the seat.
Didn't you know Tom was going to do that?
I'm very happy for the both of you.
The old are not always wiser than the young.
Can I go play in my room?
It was the perfect moment for a kiss.
How do they prepare this fish in France?
Tom has lost weight.
She studied Japanese after dinner.
Will you go on foot or by bus?
I know that Tom is a doctor now.
They both snickered.
Cattle were grazing in the field.
She has buried her only son.
The car slowly gathered speed.
Tom likes it in Boston.
Have you hidden anything?
I don't think everybody gave up.
Tom got good grades.
"Tom has told you about what happened, hasn't he?"
Don't let Tom leave.
I like the way you think.
The square of 5 is 25.
Are these my socks or yours?
I thought that you looked sad.
We were both in the library.
Replace those books on the shelf when you're done with them.
Have you read any interesting books lately?
There isn't much furniture in my room.
It seems worthless.
I've known how to do that since I was a child.
Do you believe that people are capable of change?
I've never kissed Tom.
I don't remember you.
I'm studying now.
See you around.
Your French is much better than mine.
I didn't expect to meet you.
"Tom looked everywhere for Mary, but couldn't find her."
"Tom and Mary are both thirty, but they look much younger."
I bought a pair of leather shoes.
All I wanted was to be with you.
Do I look stupid?
The dog is biting Tom.
Thank you for this.
I knew you'd be able to do that.
Tom promised to give me more time.
No one here can swim.
Are you tired?
Tell me what you know about Tom.
You don't need to take your shoes off.
Even the richest man in the world can't buy everything.
I have climbed Mt. Fuji.
I want a lot of them.
Tom didn't tell me the whole truth.
He looked over my report.
The temperature is rising.
My hobby is collecting insects.
When do you have to leave?
Tom is a reasonable man.
I didn't know you guys were friends.
He did not read the book.
Tom is about the same age as I am.
You're expected to be here until 2:30.
Keep it a secret.
They were tortured.
How many coins did you give me?
Tom moved to Australia with his family last summer.
The girl kissed her father on the cheek.
Have you read today's paper?
Don't make me kill you.
I need to go back.
Are you still sick?
I told Tom that I wasn't ready.
Her story can't be true.
Please explain what's happening here.
Tom has been through a lot.
I know you're smart.
I'm going to find you.
Tom is only trying to help.
Tom told me that Mary had already left.
How old do you think Tom is?
October is still three months from now.
I wasn't the one who did that.
I'm too old for such things.
Where are you planning to go?
Aren't you going to eat breakfast?
She's a model.
Why don't you join us?
Were you alone?
I'd rather go today than tomorrow.
What did you buy Tom for Christmas?
See you in two weeks.
You must go there immediately.
Tom is never here in the morning.
Tom has already been told about what happened.
Tom trusts me.
They went back.
It's getting cold.
I can't hear a word.
I must do that.
Tom stood alone.
I hope they do it.
It's dirt cheap.
Is your room warm?
This would be catastrophic.
This car is very expensive.
Your problem is similar to mine.
Tom isn't sure where Mary parked her car.
He sent flowers to his mother.
I can't go to the concert with you tonight.
I should've called a doctor.
We're not about to give up.
I think you're very talented.
Did you get in trouble?
Stop at the corner.
Please stay here.
Why do you look so pale?
I know that some of your students don't like you.
You're not the only one with this problem.
That's a good point.
I didn't expect this to happen.
How many Canadian friends do you have?
Tom is my colleague and my friend.
You should've asked me.
Don't listen to Tom. He's lying to you.
Let's not look for problems.
Tom had shoes on.
She majored in history.
I decided to stay one more day.
Everyone knew about it.
It's unauthorized.
I'm so happy we understand each other.
She's lost her car key.
The police found a blonde hair in the sink.
"Do you like me, too?"
Just follow Tom.
I thought you loved Tom.
I have been to the U.S. twice.
He is polite to a fault.
Tom came into the room a few minutes after Mary.
Do you want to see Tom?
Is eating less meat a good idea?
The law has been changed.
What're you watching?
I didn't know you believed in ghosts.
Put that back.
Tom wasn't even here.
Don't forget to call me tonight.
He got up and left in the middle of the discussion.
Are you her friend?
Nagoya is famous for its castle.
Can anyone verify this?
"Tom doesn't look happy, does he?"
I'd wait longer if I could.
You never told me about this before.
Tom isn't what he seems.
Didn't you know that Tom is in Australia now?
I don't know what'll happen now.
We kissed each other.
I thought you didn't know Tom.
Show it to us.
Tom put Mary to bed.
Is it very small?
Tom has already been transferred to another hospital.
I want a new coat.
You're very smart.
All his life Tom was an outsider.
Let's get together and talk about old times.
I filled in my name on the paper.
I have to ask you about Tom.
That boy said his name was Tom.
Tom is against smoking.
Tom and Mary bought a car for their son.
I don't think you'll like this movie.
I'm sure you'll never regret it.
Tom wasn't upset by what Mary did.
I was trying to rescue Tom.
You'd better come inside.
I won't eat this.
I suspect that you don't need to do that.
I think Tom is unlucky.
How do you say that in Italian?
I don't want you to fear me.
He may have seen it.
"Do you drink coffee? If so, how often do you drink it?"
I received a letter from my sister.
Do you know that for a fact?
He's innocent.
I have to go to the library with Tom.
May I call you tomorrow?
Tom doesn't have health insurance.
I'm free this evening.
I made you coffee.
We must consider the financial aspects of this project.
She has short hair.
He made us do the work.
I don't know if Tom will come.
He put the blue folder down on the table.
I would like a word with you.
I took a nap.
Aren't you married?
He went home at six.
We provided them with money and clothes.
He'll go to the hospital today.
I told you to stay away from Tom.
It's in your pocket.
I feel so cold.
Turn down the TV.
He got up earlier than usual.
He has a car.
Would you mind if I don't go?
Tom idolized Mary.
She knows who I am.
Tom was advised to give up smoking.
I know that we can't count on Tom to do that for us.
What's Tom doing here at this hour?
I spend my free time with my kids.
Tom advised Mary to take her umbrella with her.
I don't think Tom would understand.
Tom decided to call for help.
It meant a lot to me.
Don't sit on the floor.
I think that's too expensive.
Try to have a good day.
I don't think I've changed so much.
Where are we meeting?
They stayed up all night.
Give this ticket to whoever comes first.
My success was largely due to luck.
The show is about to start.
Tom can speak French better than Mary.
People like to talk to you.
I need some soap.
Everything's in place.
Please tell Tom to close all the windows.
Tom left the bar with three other men.
Tom took the orange juice out of the refrigerator.
I used to work for a small company in Boston.
The roses smell nice.
There is no water.
Tom repeated the word several times.
They did not clap for us.
He's an Italian teacher.
Would you accept those terms?
Can you hang on a second?
Tom couldn't decide who to assign the job to.
I'm the one who taught Tom how to play poker.
We know who you are.
The two of them fought for the prize.
Everyone was stunned.
Do you like Indonesian food?
What do I have to change?
He looked for them for five hours.
You really don't need to do that.
Is that your teacher?
Tom came at me with a knife in his hand.
It would be better to stay at home.
You're a real friend.
You're being evasive.
Do you have a pen?
I'm pretty sure Tom can do that.
Have you talked to Tom today?
Spain ruled Cuba at that time.
How is the weather in Boston?
I'm satisfied with my salary.
Have you seen my car keys?
He sank into a chair.
Is that what you were talking about last night?
I tasted the soup Tom made.
How do you know they aren't Canadians?
I cannot stop him.
Why is she here?
I plan to retire when I'm sixty years old.
Do you want us to tell Tom?
Why did Tom go to the station?
I've already spoken to Tom.
They seem American.
I know that you want to go to sleep.
Tom hasn't apologized to Mary.
My aunt speaks Chinese as well as English.
Elephants don't eat meat.
Why is Tom doing that now?
Do you want to go get a drink?
You should go see a dentist.
Let's go to sleep.
Be respectful.
Let him in.
What did Tom give to you?
I'm not perfect.
Please follow the school rules.
Lie still and rest.
Did you wait?
I added Tom's family name to the list.
Yoga can improve your posture.
God bless you!
Tom says he wants to buy a present for Mary.
I don't have feelings for Tom.
You'll see.
Tom is too picky.
"She advised him to cut down on smoking, but he didn't think that he could."
I think I'd like to be your friend.
You must learn to listen.
Drop by sometime.
I've run out of milk.
What do you usually do after dinner?
Leave me alone so I can get some sleep.
Tom delivers pizzas.
No one I know buys CDs anymore.
Tom will be busy tomorrow.
"Recently, we've been getting a lot of new customers."
I don't agree at all.
You were lucky to find it.
Did Tom vote?
It's nearly midnight in Boston.
Is the tap water in Australia drinkable?
I know that you lied.
Tom and John look similar.
Tom set a new world record.
I started to scream.
Tom couldn't understand why no one else wanted to go to the zoo.
Promise me you'll sing.
I'd like your opinion on this.
I said that I didn't go shopping with her.
I had to stay behind so I could talk to Tom privately.
You can't leave me here.
My mother asked me to set the table.
Don't leave library books in this room.
Tom is in amazing shape.
Would you teach me how to make cheese?
I've noticed that.
You can rest.
I hope you're all having a good time.
Tom will love this.
Don't let anyone stop you.
That's just a lie.
Use your head.
My parents wouldn't like that.
Shall I carry your bag?
It's pretty routine.
Buy four big potatoes for me.
It used to be taboo for women to smoke.
What's that in your hands?
I'm sure Tom will turn up eventually.
"Mary was sitting in front of the mirror, brushing her hair."
There was a big scandal.
This song is a love song.
Which one would you recommend I buy?
Do you think Tom has enough money to buy that?
Tom and Mary were here.
I had to work on an essay.
I hope that I'm not bothering you.
My life is a disaster.
Tom showed me the letter.
What are you saving up for?
Tom leaves his dirty clothes lying all over the house.
You're bound to succeed in the long run.
Tom told Mary to stop crying.
Tom and Mary are both asleep.
How old is your grandfather?
I used to play alone when I was a child.
I am tired of listening to Tom.
Tom said he would never come back here again.
Show your cards.
"He said, ""Leave me alone."""
Tom had a minor accident.
Didn't you know anything about this?
Did you make any friends?
Tom is a little older than the rest of the students in his class.
Do you come to this restaurant often?
Tom took a painkiller.
Did you refresh the page?
Tom won't likely be home on Monday.
I discussed the problem with Tom.
Even a child can understand that.
You may need this.
Do you know what Tom's plans are?
It was Tom who started the fight.
Please bring a cup of tea to me.
I ran a race with him.
Tom was fired on October 20th.
It hasn't been easy for Tom to learn how to walk again.
You're too old.
You can't learn that in school.
I didn't find Tom.
How did Tom respond to that news?
Make me a sandwich.
The island is covered with ice and snow during the winter.
Could you take me there?
Tom is the only person I can really trust.
Tom almost spilled his coffee.
You never told me that you didn't know how to speak French.
Is everyone happy?
Tell Tom what's going on here.
His mother made him clean the bathroom.
It was never like that.
The burglar gained access to the house through a window.
Tom looks like you.
My dog bit Tom's leg.
I meet a lot of people.
I spoke with Tom yesterday on the phone.
Did you meet anyone on the road?
This was his one and only hope.
She has nice legs.
Is your wife tall?
An innocent man was arrested by mistake.
Please turn off the television.
It's better to be thought a fool than to open your mouth and prove it.
Tom cheated on the test.
Tom buys and sells old books.
I didn't think you'd go to Boston.
I am not thirsty.
Tom regarded the statue carefully.
It's still light out.
It was at school.
I have been lucky until now.
Don't wake the baby.
You should wash your hands.
I have to know.
This one is even better.
I don't know why I did it.
Don't worry. I'll stay with you.
Do you like my friend?
Never tell lies.
When did you lose your job?
That's Tom's car.
Don't forget that you're spending my money.
He hasn't returned yet.
I'm glad you like our house.
Could you please tell me your height and weight?
I can survive this.
I think it worked.
Where could they be?
I want Tom to suffer.
This house is too big for us.
Can't you see it's bigger than the both of us?
Do you know who this snowboard belongs to?
Tell them what you told me.
I wanted you to be proud of me.
I'm good at soccer.
What's the point of your question?
Whose food is this?
Tom doesn't like to sing sad songs.
These sunglasses are very expensive.
I know a good lawyer who can help you.
Nobody wants it.
The ocean was calm.
He was framed on a murder charge.
I won't give them to you.
Let Tom sleep.
We're working for you.
Teachers must understand children.
I don't believe in keeping my feelings bottled up.
What makes you think you can do it now?
How's my son doing?
I was angry.
What's the matter with you? You look pale.
Am I the only one who agrees with you?
I hadn't planned on staying so long.
Tom had never seen Mary so unhappy before.
I don't know why Tom gave up.
Not everyone agrees with Tom.
Could you please help me do that?
Tom zipped his bag shut.
You don't want this.
I didn't know.
The children are still awake.
"Tatoeba means ""for example"" in Japanese."
Have you had lunch?
I thought Tom could help.
Tom gave Mary plenty of money.
Dig a deep hole.
I didn't want to wait.
I used to wear glasses.
How many weeks will it take you to do that?
The old man spoke with me in French.
How exactly did Tom win?
Is this the train for New York?
It's a risk we'll have to take.
Criminals should go to jail.
I want you do to that.
I have two gifts for friends.
Tom paid no attention to Mary all afternoon.
We can't lie to Tom.
Tom doubts that Mary can take care of herself.
I'm going to wear my blue jacket.
You'll get over it.
Please speak more quickly.
Tom asked Mary to tell John something.
Where are you living?
I'll call you as soon as I get home.
The little girl has a doll in her hands.
He's in his late fifties.
What did you see in the kitchen?
Don't run.
I can't deny that.
"When you're ready, tell me."
I wonder whether Tom was surprised.
Does anybody have a pencil?
They saw something strange.
Tom said he didn't like the taste of beer.
Tom volunteered to do that.
How adventurous!
"Here, try these."
The man finally confessed what he had done.
Tom shouldn't have told you.
I wonder when Tom will arrive.
You shouldn't let people use you like that.
You've dropped your wallet.
You have a beautiful daughter.
These are my CDs.
Are you happy now?
I love this game.
Tom didn't want to go to the meeting.
I don't see any customers complaining.
I've already visited Australia.
I would never kill myself.
"Tom and Mary got married on October 20, 2013."
What were you doing in Boston last week?
The book was published after the author's death.
I think we can do it tomorrow.
We are a perfect match.
Go away!
I want to make some changes.
Who taught you to write?
We've been together long enough.
Their eyes met.
"I don't want you to do that, Tom."
You should be at home with Tom.
How do you like them apples?
Let's ask Tom why he was late.
It's unusually warm.
Tom forgot his umbrella in his car.
Tom is the tallest person that I know.
I thank you for that.
He sat on the bench.
Will you take me there?
Do you want me to ask Tom?
I'm sure you deserve better.
Don't leave!
I didn't go.
I was there three days.
I found it in the attic.
Finding an apartment can be difficult.
I want each of you to take out a piece of paper and write down what happened.
I saw Tom give Mary a peck on the cheek.
People act without thinking sometimes.
Look at this one.
This song is known to everyone.
The bookstore is open.
The situation is very bad.
How high is this mountain?
I'm not afraid of your dog.
I turned the doorknob.
Why don't you tell me what you remember?
You aren't yourself today.
Tom is the teacher.
What's wrong with these?
Tell Tom I won't leave.
"Don't sass your father, Tom."
"If it is sunny tomorrow, we will go on a picnic."
Tom is not serious about his studies.
How much time is left?
People could have avoided many mistakes by simple experiments.
We're not young.
I'm very worried.
That clock is slow.
My mother hates to write letters.
It doesn't matter whose fault it is.
Nobody said that.
Tom is studying French.
I see you're wearing a new hat.
What do you know about cloning?
Try not to worry about what others think.
Your arm's broken.
Wives usually outlive husbands.
I was scared that you might leave me.
The petals are floating on the water.
I think about it sometimes.
I don't think anybody could've stopped Tom.
You may invite whoever you like.
He fell in love with his best friend.
Tom is old enough to be your grandfather.
Tom and I are back together.
"If you need any help, call me."
Stand on the scales.
He admitted that he was guilty.
We have a test tomorrow.
Tom sang in the church choir.
The door of the meeting room is open.
I have three times as many books as Tom.
I was bluffing.
Are you telling me Tom doesn't do that anymore?
Tom said you were happy.
You may laugh.
I'll watch TV.
I'd like to improve my French.
Beijing is changing so rapidly.
I came looking for you.
You can tell Tom.
I won't help you.
Tom was in almost every photo in Mary's album.
The temperature went down three degrees.
Tom says he wants to go to Boston with us.
He is accustomed to hard work.
Tom and Mary were among the new arrivals.
About thirty people have registered.
What're you working on?
How much will it cost me?
"That old man is, so to speak, a walking dictionary."
We can't get out. Someone locked the door from the outside.
I'm amused.
Tom thinks I'm a loser.
I suspected Tom wouldn't be able to do that.
I sat between Tom and Mary.
Is it not black?
Tom walked with Mary.
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting for so long.
I felt out of place in the expensive restaurant.
I wouldn't do that that way.
You've been married a long time.
Call me if anything changes.
The ribbon doesn't match the dress.
I'm a picky eater.
I miss my family.
Hand it to Tom.
Plastic in landfills lasts for hundreds of years.
This book is too difficult for me.
Haven't you been listening?
Are you going to take part in the next race?
I thought everyone knew.
His family is large.
You will gain nothing from doing that.
He told me that he would leave before long.
Tom is often late for appointments.
Did you fix it?
Tom won't have to do that himself.
It's working.
I take my hat off to you!
I'll never get over that.
I forced him to go.
You shouldn't have come.
People ask me that question all the time.
I didn't ask whether you wanted to go.
You're being used.
Tom is going to be back in a few minutes.
I haven't told Tom.
We know who he is.
Do you believe me?
We didn't really have very much to drink.
Aren't you finished here yet?
They'll find him.
They don't listen to us.
She does look tired.
Does Tom need a doctor?
I was a teacher for fifteen years.
The president was elected for four years.
Tom apologized to the families of the victims for the explosion at the factory.
What on earth are you doing?
Do you mind eating in the kitchen?
You'd better hold your tongue.
He also speaks French.
I was amazed at Tom's fluency in French.
I've never been to Australia.
It is too late.
I talked to Tom.
It's to your advantage to learn everything you can.
Thanks for your reply.
I think this tastes good.
My dad works all day.
She is appearing on TV tonight.
My goldfish died.
It was destroyed.
I don't know what I should've done.
The fire destroyed three houses.
Tom doesn't like Boston much.
Tom is frequently late for school.
You need to help me.
I had my bicycle fixed yesterday.
There's nothing else to worried about.
You have to spend more time with your son.
Tom sent us Christmas gifts.
Do you have a girlfriend right now?
Raspberries are expensive in the winter.
"Put your coat on, or you'll catch cold."
Are you traveling alone?
It's too late to eat now.
I think Tom is still scared.
Let me take a look.
There is no reason why he should resign.
Tom became calm.
Tom always speaks his mind.
This must be hard for Tom.
Tom got on the elevator and pressed the button for the third floor.
"Go to work, Tom."
Did you find anything interesting?
I had the feeling that Tom was going to be late.
Did you really dream about me?
Could you take our picture?
Please don't be afraid.
We've learned our lesson.
It's really strange.
Don't force Tom to do that.
Is it true you hit Tom?
"Eventually, Tom's curiosity overcame his fear."
They are my sisters.
I don't care how much you want it. I'm not going to give it to you.
Metal spoons are generally made of stainless steel.
He plays the piano well.
I thought that was a good thing.
I'm not going to school today.
We're out of wine.
Do you think Tom is still home?
I really don't know.
We'll visit you tomorrow.
I made a lot of money.
That tall girl standing next to Tom is Mary.
He has not yet recovered consciousness.
Do you remember the name of your first French teacher?
I can do it with my eyes closed.
Tom is wearing a wetsuit.
You're wonderful.
Don't make the same mistake I did.
The poet committed suicide in his study.
This suit is anything but cheap.
Let's not argue anymore.
I'm sure that Tom needs to do that.
Did you receive the flowers?
Tom was rude and obnoxious.
What do you know about zombies?
I knew Tom was very busy.
Tom unlaced his shoes.
I want you to have fun.
Have fun in Boston.
I can't see the end.
Can someone call security?
I didn't catch the last word.
I wonder why she didn't tell him about it.
Tom is going to be here all day.
Has he come yet?
I'd like to earn more money.
Tom doesn't want his parents to find out.
Tom would've called Mary if he'd had her phone number.
I will soon catch up with you.
What do you want to buy?
My zipper got stuck.
I was a bit hungry.
Is the dog chained?
Find out who Tom has been talking to.
Do you want to try?
This is the dilemma.
Three of these are Tom's.
Do you still need tea?
He is always complaining.
I've seen you on TV.
We're going away.
It may well snow tomorrow night.
I don't like being controlled.
I don't want pity.
"As soon as we sat down, she brought us coffee."
I can see Tom.
Tom is a fool if he believes that story.
Tom is just trying to scare you.
Tom is afraid something bad is going to happen.
Do you remember?
They both lived in Boston.
I don't think we need permission to do this.
What I really want to do is to get some sleep.
I'm sure you'll come up with something.
Tom tore the letter to bits.
He may have missed the plane.
Tom needs answers.
Tom put all his money in the safe.
I'm not that drunk.
I've heard there are many Japanese restaurants in Australia.
Tom is going to finish doing that today.
I don't need the user manual.
Let me know if I need to make any changes.
That's all I know.
You could go back to Boston if you wanted to.
Tom had no socks on.
I'll never ever forget you.
I knew that would happen.
Tom is now three months old.
I feel like another person.
I don't know how to handle it.
There are many unresolved problems.
Are you out of work?
Tom heard a noise.
I'm not sure if I'm ready for that.
Don't smile.
Tom will be sitting in the front.
I think that Tom is taking a nap.
"If there's anything we can do, just call."
I had no problem with that.
Are you looking for something specific?
We really have to do that.
I can't stand these people.
How can you not like this?
I'd like you to translate this report into French.
That was impressive.
I promise you won't be disappointed.
I read that a typhoon is coming.
We'll leave as soon as it stops raining.
"This dictionary has about 40,000 entries."
My new job starts on Monday.
You can't use this.
"When you have a cold, you should drink plenty of liquids."
Prices have soared.
Why didn't you try to run away?
Why did you come?
I'll be next.
We needed your help.
"Does Tom want to do that, too?"
Just don't disappear.
It is not good for her to live alone.
He has just bought a used car.
My heart broke at the sight of the dying birds.
They're playing football.
I think Tom will wait for you.
I saw him tear up the letter.
"You don't mind, do you?"
It's very close.
We talked about French.
Tom and Mary talked about the weather.
I knew that Tom was in Boston.
I don't trust anyone except myself.
Tom just listened.
Nobody noticed Tom's absence.
Give it to him.
Were you the one who cleaned the kitchen?
He has been sick in bed all week.
That would be normal.
Please tell me about your children.
I think you're smarter than Tom.
I'm not rich enough to buy that.
Tom has never played poker with us.
Tom will explain it to you.
Tom does that every evening.
He teaches us English.
We had to go there together.
Have you read the report?
I was trying not to look at Tom.
I'd like to learn to play the harp.
Didn't you see it?
I don't play the oboe.
I thought you'd find that interesting.
We don't even know Tom.
I broke my leg.
What color is your dog?
Where are you going to live?
I'm accustomed to this.
I wish you hadn't seen me doing that.
They want to meet you.
This worries me a lot.
Do you allow your children to eat ice cream?
"Because of the snow, I couldn't see anything."
"Whatever happens, don't panic."
I really want you to meet Tom.
Share your secret with me.
What did you do on the weekend?
They never studied in school.
Wooden houses catch fire easily.
"Which one do you prefer, the red one or the blue one?"
Tom encouraged me to learn French.
You can spend the night at our place.
I know Tom is worried.
"You recognize him, don't you?"
I usually walk to school.
I'm losing blood.
I don't know why Tom is here.
One of my friends bought a red car.
You have to do that today.
You're too young to do that.
I don't know how it started.
I forgot to ask him.
They're eating sandwiches.
Is that supposed to be a compliment?
It's not possible to do two things at once.
Tom is now working in Boston.
The news can't all be bad.
Tom ran out of his house in a hurry.
No one trusts him anymore.
I just did what Tom told me to do.
You're all I've got.
Do you talk about us?
Please listen very carefully.
You need me here.
Tom is a better driver than Mary.
I haven't had a boyfriend in a long time.
The gate is too narrow for the car.
I think Tom is the only one here who knows where Mary lives.
Tom gave Mary plenty of time.
Please give us our money back.
We both hate you.
You're my best customer.
Let's go to my place. There's something I'd like to show you.
Will you miss me?
That's an excellent choice.
Tom should apologize for what he said.
How was today's test?
Tom didn't seem to understand what was happening.
Stop listening to Tom.
I didn't think you'd be ready.
I knew you wouldn't want to do that.
Tom wasn't awake yet.
Tom needs to be quieter.
That's why you're still single.
"Tom will win, don't you think?"
They say Tom is gone.
When are you going to tell Tom about what happened?
How many centimeters are in a meter?
Tom made peace with Mary.
He told his son to get down from the ladder.
I didn't know Tom was still in prison.
I won't let you jump.
Tom won't back down.
That's the least of my worries.
She went to Paris to study music.
Do you really want to talk to me?
I want to show Tom around town.
"Most serial killers have experienced brutal childhoods, but very few people who experienced brutal childhoods later become serial killers."
You're so good at singing.
Tom has never killed anybody.
What's Tom done now?
How long have you been watching me?
Take this.
That's very good advice.
They quarreled among themselves.
Tom and I despised Mary.
I think it's a good plan.
We asked everybody the same question.
None of my children like Boston.
We'd like to ask you a few questions about Tom.
I'll check the list.
Tom will be on duty tomorrow.
We've never seen Tom like this before.
You can't cheat fate.
You've got two choices.
Are you sure there's no possibility?
I agreed to help.
I know you like Tom.
You cannot purchase this medicine without a prescription.
There's no point doing that.
You know what I'm talking about.
Tom looks sick.
I'm really hungry.
Please just listen.
Turn right at the end of that street.
What are they doing here?
Tom kicked off his sneakers.
Everything was fine until Tom set the house on fire.
I took it for granted that you were on our side.
Tom hasn't yet said anything to me about that.
The rest is here.
I'm going to clean your bedroom today.
I think you've made a terrible mistake.
I think he's tired.
Tom wondered if he should tell Mary the truth.
Life's unfair.
Tom is most likely eating now.
You're on the wrong road.
I made the train.
Tom cheated on his girlfriend for months.
The thief ran fast.
We already tried that.
Tom buttoned his coat.
You can say that to Tom yourself.
Tom wasn't in a joking mood.
I got back to Boston yesterday.
I told Tom you'd leave on Monday.
What time is it in Boston?
"Tom gave me the key, but I lost it."
You must read this book.
Was that supposed to scare me?
"The road is icy, so please be careful."
They know that.
Everybody's dead.
It was hard for me to get out of bed this morning.
I met him on my way home.
Tom is a good drummer.
It's OK with me if it's OK with you.
I made very few mistakes.
The car turned abruptly.
We talked until two in the morning.
Your daughter is very pretty.
I would prefer today over tomorrow.
Can you help us tonight?
You should always wash new clothes before wearing them.
Don't you have a pen?
The drawer is empty.
That isn't actually what I meant.
I can't promise you anything.
Tom yelled in pain.
France and Britain joined the invasion.
Please come over if you have time.
What you do with it is up to you.
I am short.
I'm sure you're going to enjoy it.
Dust off the shelf.
Tom can do it faster than me.
The ingredients for this recipe are a little expensive.
Didn't you know Tom was seeing someone else?
That was my first visit to Japan.
I think you need to call Tom.
"I suspect Tom is downstairs, watching TV."
"You're not married, are you?"
Napoleon's horse was white.
We must have missed something.
I know you're both angry with me.
Where do you plan to stay in Boston?
She's too old for you.
Tom slept on the top bunk.
I'm very glad that I did it.
Which one of those is yours?
Tom was allowed to help Mary.
Didn't you know it was raining?
Why don't you want to swim today?
My vocabulary is limited.
Did they live here?
Are you saying I have no sense of humor?
Take anything you want.
Tom is a very wealthy man.
"Oh, by the way, I have something to show you."
Tom looked as if he hadn't eaten anything in a long time.
I knew Tom wouldn't leave without me.
Please be careful.
I wonder whose this is.
Tom's girlfriend saw him with another girl.
Tom knew he had to apologize.
What time do you eat dinner?
We won't need it.
The problem is what we should do with this money.
Tom bought an expensive guitar.
I'm more interested in spoken French.
Only God can help you now.
I thought you were a Canadian.
I need to talk to Tom alone.
"Whatever you do, don't forget this."
Nowadays anybody can get books.
I swear I wasn't there.
What sort of work do you do?
My car is at your disposal.
Tom talked about himself.
Don't shoot him.
How much did Tom pay you?
Tom and I became good friends.
It is not for beginners.
She needs to be more careful.
How did Tom react?
Don't talk to anyone.
Tom did something wrong again.
Neither Tom nor Mary is in a hurry.
I called them.
I'm going to church.
Can you recommend a good Korean restaurant?
Tom isn't here yet. He must've missed the bus.
Tom and Mary are really good friends.
I'm twice as old as you are.
Mary often imagines her wedding.
I know what it means to be alone.
I didn't call Tom.
I want to ask them when their wedding day is.
I know how old you are.
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
Who authorized this?
Tom stepped back.
I wish you hadn't done that.
Tom is standing up.
You haven't told me anything about yourself.
That's what I told them.
Tom and I haven't changed our minds.
I think we can do this by ourselves.
The old man fell down on the ground.
That's where I can't agree with you.
Count your change.
He denied that he knew that man.
They have already visited the United States.
Don't be afraid to make a mistake.
It looks like you want to leave.
I know Tom is Canadian.
Leave our house.
She is an expert in mathematics.
What else have you found?
I'm inclined to believe you.
We're very poor.
I haven't touched anything.
Tell me when you're coming back home.
Tom prefers not to talk about that.
Tom wanted Mary to talk to John about the problem she was having with his children.
We'll find you.
Tom heard that Mary had bought a new computer.
"As usual, Tom was late."
I think we could help each other.
My wife is trying to sleep.
Call your brother.
The concert has been canceled.
"Tom doesn't like it, either."
Which house is yours?
Tom can't go to Boston this summer.
I'm still eating.
What else has Tom told you?
Ask me something easier.
She looks young.
His car turned over several times before falling into the river.
Tom isn't much younger than Mary.
Do your homework right away.
We haven't seen Tom since yesterday.
Tom probably knew who I was.
Tom bought himself a tuxedo.
Give me a gun.
I wasn't there yesterday.
He regrets what he did.
I should have told someone.
He taught me how to drive.
I thought Tom had never been to Boston.
He burned himself badly.
They saw me.
Tom said Mary would definitely win.
Tom's face was pale.
There are over seven thousand languages in the world.
I don't really like him.
"I think Tom will do that, but I'm not sure."
Are you leaving now?
Tom knew what Mary was going to say.
How many hours a day do you swim?
It's up to you to decide what to do.
I don't completely trust you.
Can I talk to you a moment?
I had to do it.
Do you know who lives in that house?
Where can I exchange money?
It's two o'clock in the afternoon.
I was disappointed that she was not at home.
I live close to an old bookshop.
It's a very beautiful song.
You told me so yourself.
"Is there something you want to tell me, Tom?"
I've worked three hours already.
His life has completely changed when he married her.
I'll never be able to retire.
"If Tom is going to the zoo with you, I'll go, too."
I no longer love Tom.
I received your letter.
What's Mary's maiden name?
Aren't you my friend?
I hope that Tom doesn't lie to us.
They got here yesterday.
In which direction did he go?
Was Tom rescued?
Did you eat dessert?
Tom noticed blood on the floor.
Tom and I are the same age.
I don't like to drink water with ice.
It is Saturday.
Would you like to come with us?
Tom is sending a fax.
This hat is from Australia.
Do you think Tom had something to do with this?
Does she still have a temperature?
How have you been sleeping?
I think Tom really does love you.
Do you know where it is?
These pants are too big for me.
I must write in my diary every day.
I've never stopped loving Tom.
Mary has a lot of sex appeal.
I emailed Tom the pictures I took yesterday.
I know nothing about this matter.
Tom told me you're from Boston.
Tom was close to tears.
Did you pass the exam?
Tom has a daughter who is a musician.
Tom is shaken.
Tom and Mary have become friends again.
Mary can't have children.
I didn't blame Tom.
I've failed.
I hope you're happy together.
I've never been to Europe.
I do need to do that today.
We're going to have failures.
I suggest you do that by yourself.
We don't want to lose.
We are going on a school trip to Osaka Castle tomorrow.
The situation is getting worse every day.
I accept your terms.
Why don't we give Tom a call?
You don't have to go inside.
Tom said very little.
All of us were silent.
Stay here.
Tom doesn't want to apologize.
I can't stop thinking about that.
I can't get Tom out of my mind.
We've already started to do that.
You must go to work.
Tom wants it to be a surprise.
Did you all not know that was going to happen?
This is my best friend.
Could you show me this bag?
I'm sure Tom didn't mean any harm.
They arrested me.
Is it made of wood or metal?
Don't be like that.
"While he was sick, he lost a lot of weight."
I'm so frightened.
They won't hurt us.
You won't need an umbrella today.
I don't think that Tom is asleep now.
Tom walked downstairs.
You lean on your parents too much. You must be more independent.
Tom and Mary had to postpone their trip.
What did you feel?
I'm not as attentive as I should be.
I hope I'm out of the hospital before October.
Was Tom caught?
I'll play football tomorrow.
We haven't yet agreed on a price.
They'll all be here tonight.
Your joke is funny no matter how many times I hear it.
You may remain anonymous.
I'll keep you posted.
Tom used to hate Boston.
"If you don't believe me, go see for yourself."
Please open the window.
That's exactly what I want to know.
Now you listen to me.
Tell Tom to eat his vegetables.
I'm so glad you're back.
Tom almost never wears jeans.
Tom helped me with my homework.
Leather shoes cost much more.
Beautiful poppies were growing beside the road.
This vase is fragile.
What causes that?
We learn French at school.
Tom uses that word a lot.
The tea is too strong. Add a bit of water.
I came to pick Tom up and drive him home.
I'll be busy until 2:30.
I gave my brother a dictionary.
"You're not joking, are you?"
Why do you always blame me?
How long do you think it'll take?
You play tennis well.
You don't deserve to live.
I'm losing.
I want to live with you.
My younger brother swims every day in the summer.
Do you know a good dentist?
I see you are awake.
What did Tom make you do?
Don't you want to know what's going on?
The girl is small for her age.
People have been injured.
I had no more than five dollars.
How would Tom have done that?
"You hate to lose, don't you?"
Raise your right arm.
You can do that later.
You are not logged in.
I know that you aren't ready.
How and where did Tom die?
I can't do what you want.
May I stay here with you?
I don't have the address with me.
When was the last time you squashed a spider?
Don't write in ink.
You're the expert.
I'm sure Tom didn't even notice you were late.
Do you have any idea how dangerous that is?
More information is available on our website.
The dolphin jumped out of the water.
It is not surprising that he was elected mayor.
Tom and I were both tired.
Tom has done enough.
The Chinese are a hard-working people.
He never listens to what I am trying to say.
Can you open the window?
I was hungry.
Tom said that he enjoyed it.
Tom is a cold-hearted murderer.
Tom doesn't want to be a lawyer.
I have things on my mind.
Do you trust anyone?
The hen has laid an egg.
There's no one in the classroom.
Tell me what you want me to do.
He is lacking in common sense.
When did you get married?
How can you even ask me that question?
"It might rain, but I'm going anyhow."
Get down from there.
Why don't you just buy a new one?
He moves quickly.
I don't think Tom would agree with you.
I'm enthusiastic.
Quote me an example.
I knew you were going to say that.
Tom almost never asks why.
Tom did it by himself.
How was your vacation?
Answer my questions.
Tom added some interesting spices to the stew.
I thought Tom had a place to live.
I want you to dance.
"You're in danger, Tom."
Tom rushed past me.
Are you doing that on purpose?
She devoted her life to helping the handicapped.
I said I'd figure it out.
Helium is a gas.
Do you know what Tom does for a living?
No one followed me.
I still love Mary.
"No matter what he may do, he will be praised."
I'd like to tell Tom that I love him.
I feel like I might throw up.
Tom wants to buy a dictionary.
He hurt his knee when he fell.
Does anyone know what happened?
That isn't possible.
Tom spent all morning cleaning his room.
There are no witnesses.
We like doing things our own way.
How can you concentrate?
It'd be a disaster.
We shouldn't have written that.
I think I hear them.
That's not my bike.
Tips are not accepted.
I don't believe it.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was scared.
Tom and I went to the zoo together.
I've never eaten anything as delicious as this.
I can't imagine how I'd feel in Tom's shoes.
I can't remember how long it took.
Schools were built.
Call me if you have any problems.
I caught her by the hand.
They adore you.
"As I entered the room, they applauded."
I think I could fix that.
Take us there.
Yesterday it was so cold that I stayed home.
Are you related to Tom?
Tom really did win.
Tom thinks that he's smarter than everyone else.
I would hate to be in Tom's shoes right now.
Words can't convey my true feelings.
I don't think I'm the problem.
"It was Tom, wasn't it?"
I wish we could ask Tom to help.
Tom's an expert.
Tom and Mary have become friends.
There are no girls in our class.
Don't quote me on that.
I'd never commit suicide.
Who's Tom looking at?
Is this pen yours?
Stay alert.
Tom lives with his father in Australia.
I'm not going to play golf with Tom.
Our personnel are very highly educated.
I just didn't want to give up.
It is twenty minutes past ten.
"If you're looking for Tom, he's not here."
Tom calls me every day.
They both smile.
"Without your help, he would fail."
The crown prince is the one who is to succeed to the throne.
Tom would help you if you asked him to.
I don't care about fashion.
Why did Tom want to go with us?
Tom felt homesick.
I read Tom's diary.
Let's negotiate.
What's your favorite search engine?
I don't care what society says.
Tom didn't seem to understand your explanation.
I've studied French for three years.
Tom isn't a fool.
I can see which way the wind's blowing.
Mary is a stay-at-home mom.
Tom lost some weight.
Let's do it again.
How can I trust you?
He was out of breath.
Who is this guy?
They've had plenty of time.
I wouldn't help you even if I could.
They were kind enough to assist us.
Tom used to stay home on Mondays.
What business is that of yours?
I must be going deaf.
I didn't write this letter.
Now you owe me one.
Tom and Mary must miss John a lot.
The man who wrote this book is a doctor.
How many years have you been married?
There's no point arguing with Tom.
I don't have the key to this door.
They're different.
I've never seen you laugh.
You told me to improvise.
I've been up all night studying.
Tom knew Mary wouldn't cry.
When was the last time you had your hair cut?
Get out of bed!
Still waters run deep.
How could that happen to Tom?
I made these clothes myself.
Take this box into the other room.
Do you talk about us?
I changed my shirt.
I'm glad you weren't here.
She kept on talking while eating.
I want you to take care of Tom for a little while.
Just stay where you are and I'll bring you the papers you need to sign.
I don't think that Tom was wrong.
I want to know what you mean.
Are you sure of her coming on time?
It's never happened to me.
I can't believe Tom did that to Mary.
I'm wondering if I love Tom.
Tom's not fat.
Tom is parking the car.
"You're fluent in French, right?"
I recommend it.
We have more important things to do right now.
We have three possibilities.
Sometimes numbers say more than words.
You should win today.
I'm sure you're going to enjoy it.
Algebra is my favorite subject.
Tom became very ill.
I closed one eye.
I assure you I'm in perfect health.
What made you laugh?
"If you had helped me, I could have accomplished the work."
I hope that she'll get better soon.
Women are easily moved to tears.
Can you guess what's in this bag?
Tom is the one who makes the decisions.
Find out what Tom is doing here.
Tom says he never taught French.
Tom wants to dance.
I stayed at home all day instead of going to work.
What time did you start?
I feel vulnerable.
I didn't call you.
I know what to study.
I like him very much.
We're all waiting for that to happen.
Tom told me that I could use his computer.
I talked.
Who is the wisest person you know?
I don't plan on getting caught.
Why are your eyes red?
I love summer.
I have two daughters and two sons.
Tom lives in Australia with his grandparents.
Tom's pulse is slow.
I must have forgotten it.
I'd like to call you sometime.
You betrayed me.
Tom won't catch me.
I think you don't trust me.
Tom is lying in bed with a cold.
I hope I get a watch for my birthday.
Let me go to Australia with you.
The impact of science on society is great.
We don't know Tom.
Tom had business in the city.
It's the right time.
Tom didn't deny anything.
Open the gate.
We are moving next month.
Which CD do you want to listen to?
The unexpected always happens.
She seems to be in trouble. Tell her what to do.
You seem excited.
They both giggled.
I haven't done my homework.
Tom knows what I mean.
A monkey is mature at a few years old.
Aren't you sure?
It's a first-rate hospital.
We searched everywhere but found nothing.
It was exhausting.
Boston is a nice city.
"What part of ""no"" don't you understand?"
Do you want to listen to some music?
I like your car.
I only hope Tom likes Mozart.
"Could you clear the table, please?"
She lit the candles.
I'll sleep on the couch.
It's well worth it.
"Well, let's go find out."
I wake up early.
Tom asked me to give this to you.
They live on Third Avenue.
You got here fast.
Tom boiled me some eggs.
I just want a little more coffee.
Tom talks about that a lot.
The weather was beautiful.
They won't swim.
I hear Tom is very good at swimming.
Do you still need me?
Have you read this yet?
Does she know your phone number?
It's human nature.
It's about this big.
You should have told me a long time ago.
Tom has no right to say that.
Tom introduced Mary to his family.
I don't think that Tom has very many friends here.
It's on the sofa.
Tom bored the guests with a long speech.
I don't remember anything.
I think that Tom is interested.
Three pages have been torn out.
Mary is lovely.
I need to learn French.
Tom doubts if Mary will come to his birthday party.
Mary is Tom's mother-in-law.
Stop babbling.
I'm not kidding.
I wrote the note.
Tom had no one else to turn to.
Mary has very long hair.
Tom knows a lot about baseball.
Tell them what I told you.
Do you really think I can do this?
Can I make a reservation?
I'm starting to like you.
Can you feel it?
Tom cut himself chopping onions.
I don't have time to help now.
I'd agree.
You owe me nothing.
But Dad won't like it.
He's looking at you.
Do you consider them dangerous?
I'll be with Tom today.
Do you want to play a game?
Could you lend me your bicycle for a couple of days?
"How tall are you, and how much do you weigh?"
"What have you heard, Tom?"
Is there something in your room you don't want me to see?
"Do you want to buy it? ""Yes."""
I will call you without fail.
I couldn't have expressed it better.
Mary usually wears earrings.
I hear from my friend every month.
I want you to do it at once.
Don't make me mad.
I think she is sick.
Don't sit on the table. It could break.
How much money did Tom promise you?
No one sat in the back.
Do you have any other suggestions?
I wish you hadn't told that story to my mother.
I didn't know their names.
"Last night, I listened to radio."
You're a funny gal.
I don't think that Tom has enough money to buy a ticket.
"That's your favorite, right?"
You always destroy everything.
Do you believe in such things?
He owns a very valuable wristwatch.
I go to the hairdresser's every month.
How much did you drink last night?
They set up a fund to support the victims.
Have you had breakfast yet?
Are they doing anything right now?
That's all I have to say to you.
I'm not sure anybody would be willing to help me.
I'm not acquainted with Tom.
I'm here.
Tom lives on the same street as Mary.
How many people did you invite?
Tom drove Mary to the station.
"Tom is fluent in French, English and German."
Tom had three aces.
I really wish I didn't have to tell you this.
My father listens to classical music.
Put that in writing.
Do you still play the piano?
I know as much as you do.
Tom dashed to the corner to mail a letter.
I miss Tom. I hope he comes back soon.
Don't threaten me. I won't say anything.
Why did we have to wait so long?
I've seen a lot.
It would've been better if you hadn't gone there.
"Check it out, Tom."
Tom bought a used car last week.
"When I woke up, I found I had been tied up."
We learn by trial and error.
Making a good start is half the battle.
So what did you talk about?
I knew I could rely on you.
Tom wants you to come to his birthday party.
Let's drink beer.
The tower is going to collapse.
I made a big decision today.
I know you don't know either.
I can do that much better than Tom can.
Tom thought that Mary was at home.
I saw your father.
What are you looking for there?
I don't want to leave Tom.
Tom is lying about that.
Something is still not right.
Love is blinding you.
I laughed and Tom laughed with me.
Are you sure that's what you want?
Tom didn't play soccer.
I decided it was a good idea.
Tom looked like a doctor.
Tom had never been so busy before.
Tom didn't have lunch.
My wife beats me.
I'm not hungry.
They hurried out.
Don't interrupt people when they're talking.
She can sew very well.
I don't think we'll have enough time to do that.
I'll wait a little longer.
Tom is an atheist.
Isn't that a surprise?
I think I'll be able to go swimming with you today.
Do you have any idea how unhealthy that is?
Tom said he wasn't afraid anymore.
It's in a safe place.
You must quit drinking.
"You like to take pictures, don't you?"
Tom said that he didn't know where Mary went.
You could've drowned.
Tom is doing nothing.
Mary often quarrels with her husband.
How do you know I don't have it?
The killer was never caught.
You know I wouldn't do that.
"The weather report said that it'll rain this afternoon, but I don't think it will."
"Wait, why am I telling you this?"
I'm really not much of a guitarist.
Let's go to your apartment.
Let's go upstairs.
Don't you think it's time you left?
We have no chance of winning.
I found the keys underneath the mat.
Tom is standing at the window.
Tom refused to help Mary do her homework.
We will have little snow this winter.
We'd be safe there.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
I find that fascinating.
Mary is more beautiful than Alice.
Who made the highest score?
"If at first you don't succeed, try, try, try again."
You can thank Tom for this.
Are you saying Tom didn't have to do that?
Tom paid me.
How did you enjoy the party?
Your hands are shaking.
Your answer is incorrect.
I thought something horrible had happened.
I wonder what happened between Tom and Mary.
He is constantly complaining.
I'd really like to know.
Ask Tom where he parked his car.
Tom has decided to go to Boston next weekend.
There are still too many unanswered questions.
Do you really want to go to Boston with me?
Tom is telling a story.
I really don't understand what you're talking about.
I deserve this.
I don't own a car.
I'm not sure I'm going to Tom's wedding.
That's nothing to be sorry for.
Tom found a new job.
You've been very good to me.
I don't think Tom can really do that.
Tom is an ambulance driver.
I want a family.
I still have them.
Tom could no longer control himself.
You make me so happy.
Those are all lies.
Carelessness can lead to a serious accident.
We've already started doing that.
We're almost halfway done.
Empty your pockets.
I never mentioned you.
Tom probably hasn't done that yet.
Tom said that Mary was unlucky.
Do you want me to drive you to the airport?
I'm glad you're having a good time.
He intended to marry her.
Tom is more intelligent than I am.
We're home free.
You'll know soon.
I like Korean food.
How much honey do you need?
The book is easy.
Button up your overcoat.
It's unlikely Tom will help us.
His condition could have been worse.
Tom said that he was very mad.
I was visiting Tom in Boston.
I didn't know Tom had asked Mary to help him.
That's all I want.
We don't have time.
Tom pretended to be unhappy.
We'll swim.
He's an early bird.
I spoke to my daughter.
It rained three days on end.
Tom is your superior.
Did you help Tom wash windows?
Tom worked with Mary at a supermarket.
He asked her to call him later.
She wrinkled her brows.
Do you let your children eat ice cream?
Do you think I'm stupid?
Here's what I think happened.
Tom relied on Mary.
I don't think anybody can do that.
I had to decline his offer.
I never put sugar in my coffee.
Pizza tastes different when it's cold.
Tom isn't the only one who plans to stay.
Tom likes talking about politics and philosophy.
Tom was here this morning.
What language do you usually speak at work?
Tom didn't even notice Mary was there.
Were you drinking?
Please turn in your homework by tomorrow.
The restaurant we're going to isn't far from here.
I shouldn't have left you alone.
Even the dog ran away.
Tom isn't sick anymore.
"You really think so, don't you?"
I promise I won't tell anybody where you are.
What kind of fool do you think I am?
Is everybody having a good time?
Don't bite off more than you can chew.
We carried out our mission successfully.
She spent a good deal of money on her vacation.
It's started raining.
Every one of her songs was a hit.
"Shame on you, Tom."
Don't forget to write.
I forgot the map.
Do you really think Tom is handsome?
You underestimated Tom.
This has never bothered me until now.
Tom won't change his opinion.
How do you know how thick it is?
This is pretty accurate.
Tom wants to become a fireman.
When are you going?
Tom just walked in.
I know exactly who you are.
You don't have to apologize.
"Tom waited, but Mary never came back."
It is interesting for me to read my old diary.
I nearly spilled my coffee on the keyboard.
I promise that I won't tell anyone where you are.
I didn't know where Tom was going.
Wind up the clock.
That's no way to talk to your teacher.
Call me if you need help.
Subtract three from that number.
I hope Tom will agree to do that.
That which is easily acquired is easily lost.
I don't want you to make the same mistake I made.
When will you be back in Australia?
I don't want to change.
I'm an attorney.
I didn't send any pictures to Tom.
School bores me.
We need a ladder.
I found a pair of gloves under the chair.
Take off your shirt.
Tom misses his wife.
I need to know what you know.
Do you think Tom is drunk?
What happened to the others?
Tom reads slowly.
We're a great team.
She was approaching thirty when I first met her.
I thought Tom was with you.
Facebook is blocked in China.
Don't you like baseball?
"Do you want that? If so, I'll buy it for you."
Let Tom help you.
Tom is going to be present.
I doubt that Tom is still up.
He burst into the room.
I'm sure we'll find something there.
I know I can trust you.
That's what we talked about.
I am helping my grandfather.
"Tom said that he'd do that, too."
She will pay for everything.
I didn't understand what he said.
My wife talked me into buying a new car.
He has a great deal of experience.
I can't let you in.
I'm not going without you.
Tom had a very difficult childhood.
Tom hasn't even started.
I was on patrol.
I have a slight cold.
Do you study French?
I met Tom last night.
I'm in here.
Put on your shoes.
Everybody who was on the bus is here.
Tom said that Mary is shy.
Tom thinks he's the only person in town who can play the bagpipes.
Why did Tom yell at you?
I want to get married.
Tom wanted to ask Mary a favor.
I'm glad you asked that.
This photo was taken in Boston three years ago.
Try not to make a habit of this.
It's getting bigger.
Have you asked the others?
Tom looked at his watch to see what time it was.
Everyone was looking for Tom.
Tom thought you knew Mary.
He studies Chinese.
I burned the newspaper.
Now is not the time to do that.
I regarded Tom as a friend.
Tom goes to school on foot.
Would anyone like some coffee?
You must move quickly.
Tom is no match for me.
I just want a fresh start.
We saw Tom leaving.
I didn't know that Tom lived in Boston.
He married a stewardess.
Why do you like Boston so much?
Mary helped her mother prepare dinner.
You look so handsome.
Tom has been working all day.
I'm not going to tell Tom what to do.
You must've known.
Where's Tom going?
Tom told us his story.
I can't believe you fell for that.
Tom is a draft dodger.
I'd buy it.
I recognised him immediately.
I think I found what you're looking for.
Do you disagree with that?
He doesn't speak my language.
Tom's horse is a lot faster than mine.
Tom is a mathematician.
It looks like Tom is home.
It's very likely someone will be waiting for us.
I can do what you asked me to do.
He can play tennis very well.
You're useless.
Tom is already asleep.
I don't think people should make a mountain of a mole hill.
I'm not here to fight.
I told you what Tom said.
I bought the same shirt as yours.
Have you already been to Australia?
I know you aren't ready.
Promise me that you won't tell anybody.
He accepted my present.
Sales are down now.
I knew Tom didn't like me.
She helped me out countless times.
Time flies when you're having fun.
Her eyes were full of sadness.
Mary ironed her blouse.
I don't know what caused it.
Has Tom finished his homework?
Tom will unlikely win today.
Tom will be here again.
"As soon as she saw me, she burst out crying."
I don't have time to read.
Haven't you read this book?
He will arrive within an hour.
Tom is recovering from his wounds.
I've tried doing that.
It was already dark when Tom got home.
"In the end, the diligent person succeeds."
I doubt that Tom planned to spend so much time on that project.
We will fight.
I arrived later than usual.
Tom and Mary got married in October 2013.
You certainly are an interesting person.
I teach mathematics and physics.
Tom has lost his mind.
She talks so much.
What's the trouble?
Go and look for Tom.
Tom asked me to give you a message.
I think Tom and Mary should get married.
Tom has never read the Bible from cover to cover.
I brush my teeth every morning.
Tom didn't buy what I asked him to.
I don't think that I'll have the time to help you today.
Tom used to be wealthy.
Who's driving?
What are you going to do after you leave school?
This story is true.
I am very interested in fishing.
Tom drove off in a hurry.
What do you know about winter sports?
Tell me the reason why you were late for school.
Tom is the only guy I know from Boston.
How did you and Tom meet?
It's every man for himself.
She declined the invitation.
I don't know how he can live in this mess.
He left Japan on the same day that we arrived.
Tom doesn't seem to like it.
Believe whatever you wish.
I'm shivering.
I hope it's not true.
"That, of course, does not mean that they are right."
I'll be lonely after you've gone.
What time does your plane leave tomorrow?
It happened yesterday.
I'll tell you when I get back.
We didn't know you were there.
Call the police.
I'm wondering what'll happen if I push this button.
Tom doesn't need to know the details.
Tom told me that Mary had already left.
Are you going to the theater tonight?
I'll be on time.
Tom eventually agreed.
"Tom was born October 20, 2013."
I just tried to stay focused.
How does it feel to be back home?
I hope you don't mind.
I really don't think you'd understand.
He went there by himself.
We made a banner.
I'm convinced Tom had nothing to do with what happened.
We're extremely concerned about that.
I don't know who to trust anymore.
We don't sell fruit here.
Now we'll never know.
Tom was awakened by the ruckus.
Paper was invented in China.
I can't ride a motorcycle.
May I borrow your lighter?
I want mine.
Can we trust Tom?
I'm clearly doing something wrong.
"Don't forget to bring it, OK?"
I've decided to study French.
I wasn't surprised that Tom didn't know what to do.
You won't be happy there.
Look at the mountains covered with snow.
When did you buy it?
I still think we should've stayed home.
I don't really trust you.
Tom wasn't bluffing.
Tom is just a child.
Tom did it again.
"Can we have another round, please?"
I don't want you to get involved.
I don't think Tom could do that even if he tried.
I must be sure.
The banks are closed today.
You are blinded by love.
Which team is winning?
I considered it a life or death matter.
I decided not to try anymore.
May I speak to you alone?
I think you know that isn't true.
Tell me what to do with it.
I got a rash on my hands from dishwasher detergent.
Did you telephone him?
"Few people know what the word ""hipster"" means."
I was young and stupid.
"Mary is older than her husband, isn't she?"
Tom ignored my advice.
I knew this would happen again.
Tom could've invited me.
Could I have some towels?
Tom told me you were going to die.
I simply don't understand.
This is all so complicated.
You go first.
Let us help you.
I heard screams.
How's the weather?
They won't talk.
You handled that situation quite well.
Tom thinks he knows what Mary is doing.
The prevention of forest fires is everyone's responsibility.
Why don't you come to the beach with us?
Guess how old I am.
Tom says he'll only speak to Mary.
"I understand French, but I can't speak it."
Please take care of my birds while I am away.
It could take a couple of days.
"I would've told you, but Tom made me promise not to tell."
Start singing.
I'm unambitious.
Does Tom still always speak French to you?
I was very shy when I was a child.
I just found it.
Maybe we should ask someone for help.
I like yogurt.
Tom said he saw something weird on the other side of that mountain.
Tom has a lot of hard work ahead of him.
That's a really nice story.
Does anybody in your family smoke?
Do you understand the difference?
She brought up the three children alone.
Tom never went back to Boston.
Wood burns easily.
May I borrow your headphones?
I know the boy.
I'm a golfer.
"This way, please."
I keep thirteen cats.
You're very curious.
Isn't this illegal?
Tom doesn't care who does the job as long as the job gets done.
It's not easy to win.
Tom and Mary quickly became friends.
You've been deceived.
Tom scribbled something on a piece of paper.
Who did you come with?
How long have you been working here?
Ask Tom when he'll be here tomorrow.
The problem is in that we don't have enough money.
Tom seems unusual.
I'm sure I can do that.
Tom brought a bottle of tequila.
Tom used to be my boyfriend.
How can we change that?
I broke the rules.
That's not the only reason.
There is a kite flying above the tree.
Tom had a big fight with his mother.
"He said, ""I want to be a doctor."""
Did you make it by yourself?
That wasn't my fault.
You're the one who should be worried.
Perhaps Tom was right.
You must stand in a line to buy the ticket.
She hit him hard.
Tom said Mary isn't jealous.
I know you better than you think.
Tom won't leave you.
Don't you know what it is?
Is someone knocking on the door?
"Next time, I'll do it myself."
Someone must have left the water running.
Be on time.
Mary was like a sister to me.
He paid double the usual fare.
It wasn't important.
How many languages can you speak?
Tom and I are worried.
Tom walked Mary home.
Industrialization often goes hand in hand with pollution.
She knows your mother very well.
Tom's head is bandaged.
Do you often go to see plays?
We can both do it.
We shouldn't resort to violence.
Tom gets angry very easily.
Could you tell us something about yourself?
Were you with anyone?
I currently live in Boston.
Everyone is unique.
Where's my mother?
Give me Tom's address.
We're the owners.
Tom is inconsistent.
I'm afraid for you.
That doesn't worry me at all.
Don't let Tom sing.
It's not as easy as you think.
Smoking isn't allowed here.
Tom slept an hour.
I think Tom is weird.
"Which one did Tom give you? ""That one."""
Tom has a cat.
She is an expert.
Do you remember what happened last night?
Are you sure you don't want a cup of coffee?
The telegram was a trick to get her to come home.
Please be a little bit quieter.
Tom sat alone at a table near the window.
Tom drove.
I'd never allow you to do that.
I'll find out how much money Tom needs.
My father has recently returned to Japan.
This boy is my son.
Why does Tom want to be a teacher?
I hate hypocrites.
I should know that.
I think there are many who binge eat from stress.
I don't think Tom will be able to talk Mary into doing that.
I'm wealthy.
"Why is it OK for men to do that, but not women?"
Cheer up!
Tom got here on Monday.
She gave me an icy look.
Is there a drugstore nearby?
"After he had finished his homework, he went out for a walk."
He isn't the kind of person who we want to work with.
Music is my life.
He came in person.
The job isn't suitable for young girls.
Is it true Tom is moving to Australia?
I was very lucky.
It rained three days ago.
Excuse me. Do you speak English?
Please come tomorrow.
Tom has started crying.
It's just your imagination.
You can sit wherever you want.
Where did you get these clothes?
My mother appears young for her age.
We were born on the same day.
I thought Tom was mad.
I apologize for not replying right away.
"Unfortunately, no one told us."
I have some friends in the police department.
Is there anything that you want to tell me?
Tom made his bed.
It is time for you to go to bed.
Your birthday is coming.
I have to go pack.
I feel relaxed with you.
Tell Tom you lied.
Tom apologized for calling so late at night.
"Far from hesitating, she willingly offered to help me."
Tom looked very old.
Maybe you're doing that wrong.
I can't remember his name.
Tom believes that the death penalty should be abolished.
I really have to get this done today.
The school is only a five-minute walk.
Why are you telling me all this?
I asked you a question.
I didn't know whether Tom wanted to go to Boston with me or not.
Tom started to descend the stairs.
I want you to do that at once.
How much did you pay for that suit?
Please tell me how to pronounce this word.
I wish I could speak French like you.
He squinted.
No registration is required.
Let's go there.
He interpreted my silence as consent.
Do you have brothers and sisters?
Do you have a pen or pencil?
I took advantage of a sale and bought three sweaters.
Push the table over by the window.
I'll arrive on the 20th of October.
Tom shot me in the leg.
Tom did everything the way Mary told him to.
"You speak French, right?"
I'm very happy to make your acquaintance.
Is Tom doing OK?
She did it on purpose.
I'd be very grateful if you'd help me.
"You can come, but don't tell anybody else."
"If you want to sit down, sit down."
He turned to the left at the corner.
We should invite Tom over for dinner.
I'm not as creative as Tom is.
What a strange guy!
I really enjoyed myself.
I have no idea what I need to do now.
Let's all go to Tom's.
Did you get good marks?
See you later.
"I wanted to tell you, but Tom told me not to."
We're always careful.
It's easy to catch a cold.
I know who said that.
The boy with blue eyes is Tom.
Tom made a few mistakes on the test.
You've got to be joking.
You've got two choices.
You've done everything you can do.
Tom has really helped a lot.
I put it in the drawer.
I have read three books since this morning.
I'm sorry for shouting at you.
I've already got a place to live.
Please remember to mail this letter on your way to school tomorrow morning.
We received a warm welcome.
The temperature fell to five degrees below zero.
Tom is our manager.
Both of them survived.
She will have a baby next month.
Didn't you know that was going to happen?
Please adjust the television picture.
Please give this box to Tom.
I think I deserve an answer.
We ran out of gas in the middle of the desert.
I'll lend you what little money I have on me.
It's what you deserve.
You've got to be joking.
Spinach is good for you.
We all hope I'm right.
I lived abroad for ten years.
Tom said he needed to take a nap.
Tom may come at any time.
Both Tom and Mary know that that isn't likely to happen.
Don't push me!
Tom is the right man for Mary.
Which umbrella is yours?
Do you know what's happened to Tom?
Is everybody happy?
She finished the job with ease.
I don't know anything about him except what you told me.
She spoke scarcely a word of English.
What a lovely doll!
She is devoted to her children.
Did you believe Tom?
I saw Tom leaving his house.
Don't look for us.
I am only joking.
Everybody wants to live in comfort.
Tom isn't the sort to apologize to anyone.
"Bring me some bread, butter, ham and cheese."
Are you waiting for someone?
You should've introduced yourself.
Cut the cake with that knife.
"If the coffee is too strong, add some more water."
"If I were more creative, I would try to write music."
Where did you find the keys?
He wants to go.
They both work.
There was no hot water.
Tom shuddered.
Tom played the guitar and everyone sang.
Tom called Mary to ask her out.
I'm sure you'll find something in the refrigerator.
I go to school every morning.
How many times did Tom win?
Tom and Mary look very tired.
We have a spelling test every Monday.
He rose to his feet to greet me.
There is a spoon missing.
I've studied French since I was thirteen.
We've got a lot of work ahead of us.
Tom said that he did his homework by himself.
My parents are strict.
I know that Tom could do that for Mary if he wanted to.
What's wrong with that?
I think you've been here before.
Did you know Tom died in Boston?
Tom never used to do that.
You lied to the FBI.
What does silence sound like?
I watched the baseball game last night.
One man was injured.
Tom paid for everything.
I shouldn't have invited Tom to the party.
We were moving a little too fast.
I have work to do.
I'm as tall as my father.
He is not what he used to be.
Are you relaxed?
No one knows you're my cousin.
There used to be a big pond around here.
I didn't know Tom was so upset.
"That's your favorite, right?"
Tom didn't need to stand in line.
This is so romantic.
His bag was badly damaged.
Is it true that you weren't here yesterday?
Tom will never forget what has happened today.
I'm pretty sure I'll pass the test tomorrow.
Tom certainly did an excellent job.
I went to the park with Mary yesterday.
They sold everything at extremely high prices.
Tom abused alcohol and pain pills.
Tom has baked a pie for dessert.
I'm very upset.
He ordered us steaks.
Can't you find it?
The first word of every sentence should be capitalized.
"You're smarter than me, aren't you?"
He was transported to a local hospital.
Would you lend me your bicycle?
Don't play in the street.
I'm new here.
She was caught red-handed trying to steal a necklace.
Is that Tom's sister?
I thought you'd be grateful.
Tom drank some juice.
We need to find out the truth.
I like crossword puzzles.
The judge condemned him to death.
How old was Tom when he started walking?
I have been reading a book all morning.
I saw a cat on the roof.
It looks fun. Why don't we try it?
Why not both?
I came to talk with Tom.
Tom has already apologized for doing that.
I want to personally thank you.
"I was very, very happy."
"If there's something bothering you, you need to tell me."
I can't see.
I can't wait to see you again.
Tom had his T-shirt on backwards.
I know Tom is fine.
Would you like to buy this?
Tom is living abroad.
I have what you need.
May I call later?
I'll wait for you.
He told me his name was Tom.
I saw the teacher walk across the street.
You're lucky that my dog didn't bite you.
I hope you didn't agree to do that.
I've always thought you knew how to swim.
Mary isn't Tom's wife.
I think my French isn't very good.
She is working on the problem.
Can I give you a ride?
Did you like that or not?
I never should've trusted you.
Are they friends of yours?
There's plenty of food in the pantry.
You said you'd do anything for me.
I've seen you somewhere.
Do you have Tom's address?
The doctors did what they could.
Don't be frightened.
Tom can't handle this alone.
It's been three years since he died.
Could you ask Tom to be quiet?
Tom was standing in the doorway.
Young children are often fascinated by science.
Tom died in the fire.
We should wait.
You're wise.
What happened was an accident.
Tom wanted to know what happened.
I had no idea you could speak French so well.
He trained very hard.
I need Tom's signature.
He was too young to live alone.
I think it won't rain tomorrow.
I've already spoken to Tom about it.
I ran away in a hurry.
When will your new novel be published?
The brothers hate each other.
The nurse soothed the crying child.
I apologize for coming by at such a late hour.
Tom stormed into the office.
Tell us what happened to you.
I locked myself out.
"You know his name, don't you?"
I'll take it if you don't mind.
Mary pulled an envelope out of her purse and handed it to Tom.
The river which flows through Paris is the Seine.
Don't ever mention his name again.
Tell me everything you know about Tom.
I've had a look.
Can I buy that?
I'm ill.
I have to see this.
Tom lacks discipline.
The clock isn't working.
Did this come with a guarantee?
This is a comfortable chair.
He lacks motivation.
Mary is Tom's stepdaughter.
He is an expert driver.
Tom wasn't the one who taught Mary how to milk a cow.
I don't know how to explain it.
We knew that Tom would win.
The dagger penetrated his heart.
I have to hurry. I'm falling behind schedule.
May I borrow it?
Don't open it.
Tokyo is a huge city.
I must convince Tom.
I think it's worth the risk.
I'm not taking sides.
I don't trust anyone.
Human relationships are very complex.
I know that Tom isn't afraid of you.
You nearly poked me in the eye with your pencil.
What're you doing in my apartment?
We'll never go back there again.
I'm not interested in the same things I think you're interested in.
Clean the windows.
I don't think Tom is asleep.
Tom turned and walked to the door.
They were so different.
I'll do anything that I can do.
We'll stick together.
It's just money.
I want you to go to the post office.
Tom looks perky.
Tom will lend you his umbrella.
My date with Tom was an utter disaster.
Coffee keeps me awake.
The news moved him deeply.
A good idea came across my mind.
I'm still in love with Mary.
Tom didn't work last Monday.
The snow will all be gone in a few days.
The atomic number for hydrogen is 1.
I'll do this myself.
I wear short-sleeve shirts in the summer.
My savings will soon run out.
I've been expecting something like that.
It reminded me of you.
The gates were closed.
You're a lot older than Tom is.
The fireman soon put the fire out.
Tom is the one who stole the money.
Somebody must've taken your umbrella by mistake.
Food and blankets were given to the refugees.
Do you know where she's gone?
"Sign here, please."
We were just trying to scare you.
Can you make a salad?
I'll be honest with you.
The whole group was punished for Tom's mistake.
My father is shaving in the bathroom.
He really likes traveling a lot.
Did anyone miss me?
We were talking.
Why don't you get something to drink?
I don't always tell the truth.
The balloon is filled with air.
I knew you'd go there.
Sing me a song.
Which brand do you prefer?
I don't think I'll be able to fix it.
My sister's going to kill me.
Why didn't Tom come yesterday?
You're generous.
What are you doing for Christmas?
I asked Tom why he was laughing.
We want to make sure.
I can't put up with him.
They've simply given up hope.
"If you have any questions, call me."
Tom has already turned in his report.
Tom never forgot Mary.
I cooked supper last night.
Neither Tom nor Mary will do that.
Tom will go skiing next weekend.
Maybe you're right.
We haven't yet decided what to do with it.
Tom opened the Bible and began reading.
Make yourself comfortable.
Now's the time to decide if you want to go with us or not.
I can buy that for you.
He appears to be strong and healthy.
I don't think we should wait any longer.
How could you not see me?
She made tea for me.
Let's meet at one o'clock.
I have a place to sleep.
I can't give up smoking.
Tom doesn't give up.
I'd love to visit Boston.
Who's fasting?
Who's your favorite drummer?
I'm sure we all agree.
Who would do such a terrible thing?
They're still in Boston.
I don't know what Tom reads nowadays.
Do you promise me you'll do that?
We're all adults.
I want to spend my life with you.
You won't need to do that anymore.
Smoking affects our health.
I'd say you're jealous.
I vowed that I would never speak to her again.
Tom took a small envelope from his shirt pocket and gave it to Mary.
I don't know what could have happened to it.
She has an absent look on her face.
You're so impatient.
Tom isn't paying us anything.
Tom has been working here more than three years.
Learning a foreign language is fun.
Where's everybody?
The company always strives to satisfy its customers.
What makes you think it's a fake?
Your handwriting is very easy to read.
I've sent you something.
I'm the captain.
Tom interpreted for me.
Mine owners refused to negotiate.
Tom often lies to Mary.
This game is interesting.
I don't have any money at all.
They had a rough time of it.
I don't care if you go or not.
I ride a bicycle to school every day.
I dislocated my knee.
Please don't tell anybody I did that.
Where were you yesterday?
Tom really loves his country.
I can do it in a week.
It's now up to you.
I'm going to leave the country.
We can't tell anybody.
Tom is the one who invited Mary.
The statue has no head.
Who wants to go hunting?
I would do anything but that.
Tom began crying.
Don't you forget that.
Tom put his shoes on.
Tom wanted Mary to talk to John.
That's what I love about you.
Did you ever talk to Tom about this?
My car is older than your car.
I think you're going to survive.
Wait for us in the lobby.
I hope Tom isn't lying to us.
Can I see the report?
We'd be crazy if we did that.
My knowledge of German is poor.
The snow is melting.
I'll be free all day Monday.
You need a vacation.
Stop acting like a child.
You're so late.
My phone is about to die.
How much cake did you eat?
How much do I owe you?
This is the book I was talking about.
I know you love Tom.
I helped Tom do his homework.
He was banished from the kingdom.
"If you could come, I'd be really happy."
I thought about you all day.
Tom wants us to go to church.
Shall I begin?
That's enough for today.
They're insane.
I wonder what Tom knows that we don't.
What're you all doing in the library?
I'm glad you're here with me.
"When I got home, I noticed that I had lost my wallet."
I'll buy the drinks.
It's very old.
How many times a week do you do that?
I wonder if I hurt Tom's feelings.
He is bound to pass the entrance examination.
Tom was probably drunk when he did that.
I wonder why Tom is doing this.
Tom thought that Mary hated him.
You have three options.
I thought that you said it was yours.
Don't take it seriously. It's a joke.
It's very odd.
Please file a written request.
Tom was afraid of catching a cold.
I've never heard of that.
I was playing soccer today.
I wasn't the one who opened the windows.
Tom lost what little money he had.
Tom told Mary that he had a long talk with John.
Tom got here before sunrise.
Please give me some paper I can write on.
Did you get something to eat?
Have any of your friends ever been arrested?
That's not so good.
I tend to procrastinate.
It's an old picture.
Add salt and baking soda to the water.
They were laughing at me.
Ask around.
Tom ran barefoot on the beach.
I have known her since she was a child.
I wanted to talk about it.
When did you start writing songs?
Tell Tom that everyone is here.
Do we have to go?
I hang out with Tom a lot.
I don't know if she will go there with me.
Tom has suggested a solution to the problem.
I suggest that you don't do that.
We didn't win the game.
Am I dying?
She is not quite content.
She gave the children two apples each.
I'll eat when I get hungry.
You should discuss this with Tom.
I should go warn Tom.
Tell Tom what Mary did.
Tom committed suicide in prison.
We're leaving.
I'm almost always late.
Leave Tom.
Our water pipes burst.
"How much is this handkerchief? ""It is ninety-five cents."""
Everyone's on vacation.
Now we're together again.
That took thirty minutes.
Tom isn't Mary's husband.
His name will soon be forgotten.
He is a genius.
I want you to do me one last favor.
She is rarely late for appointments.
I don't think that you need to do that.
You've already told me that.
You need a new car.
We have to take a stand.
I didn't have a weapon.
The rain didn't stop them from doing their job.
You should make use of this chance.
I'll stay with you.
Do you still live in Australia?
The car bumped the tree.
I'm staying at a hotel not far from here.
Did he have his trousers pressed?
Tom stayed in bed until noon.
I borrowed the book from this library.
Tom wants to learn how to draw.
You're irresponsible.
"If he comes, tell him to wait for me."
You've been acting weird today.
Could you call Tom?
We can deliver it this evening.
We were both hungry.
You're not wrong.
That's unimportant.
Why did you choose me?
Tom is afraid of me.
There are no rules.
I was nervous.
I knew this was a mistake.
I am sending you a birthday present by air mail.
Why do you interrupt me all the time?
What part of town do you live in?
I'm a mechanic.
How did you manage to convince Tom?
"How long are you in town, Tom?"
You should've listened to me.
"If you act like that, he'll think you hate him."
Tom told Mary I was afraid to do that.
Tom wouldn't have left without saying goodbye.
He set fire to his own house.
Tom has come to us for help.
"If I'd known what you were going to do, I'd've tried to stop you."
He signed the check.
Do you know where my keys are?
Let's make a deal.
We'll make you happy.
Leave it to us.
I get headaches from time to time.
I admire his courage.
Is the rat alive or dead?
The view is amazing.
What's your favorite thing to do?
What's in that box?
I don't have a white shirt.
The gate was too narrow for the truck.
He added a little sugar and milk to his tea.
Tom got very upset.
You can't save me.
I'll try it again tonight.
That's where Tom lives.
Tom doesn't give Mary flowers anymore.
You left your headlights on.
What school did you go to?
"No pain, no gain."
Are you listening to the radio?
I need to tell you something.
There's an emergency.
Keep reading.
Tom likes me.
I'll get you more.
Some people want to amend the constitution.
I just want to disappear.
Where did Tom get this ring?
Can I keep it?
That's what I said to Tom.
How did Tom know where we were going?
Tom stepped away from the door.
I've been on a diet for three weeks.
I honestly don't care.
Tom ironed his white shirt.
I'm often wrong.
We use the metric system here.
You're always busy.
Please show me how I have to do it.
His novel has been translated into Japanese.
Tom's dog killed Mary's cat.
You'll find someone.
I don't know where to put it.
I drank some beer.
Tom hasn't had his dinner yet.
There are some very strange things going on here.
"Hold the line, please."
It's going to be a busy day.
He is working on a new novel.
I'm sure we can depend on Tom.
That's a hotel.
I was just tired.
Has Tom tried it?
He teaches mathematics as well as English.
She advised him to lose weight.
That's all you need to tell me.
The kettle is on the table.
I wouldn't want to do that.
Haven't I convinced you?
Who else did you help?
You're generous.
I'm no quitter.
I took my shoes off and threw them out the window.
It can be done.
Believe whatever you wish.
Come here this minute.
Tom donated a lot of money.
Relax.
Tom is on vacation in Australia.
Didn't you see the musical?
I have no reason to lie to you.
Tom could hardly breathe after the race.
You have to see them.
Should I buy it?
Tom reminds me of his father.
Tom wants to talk about what happened.
Tom picked up the knife.
They are arguing.
Tom said Mary died in her sleep.
What is your favorite animal?
I'm very grateful to you.
The man you met at the station is my father.
"I tried to eat it, but I couldn't."
I pointed my camera at her.
Please tell me where you will live.
I don't remember asking you to do that.
Tom laughed and threw a pillow at me.
"I'm sorry, I don't have change."
I've never flown in a plane.
She tore the letter to pieces.
It's a single-cell organism.
It was a tragedy.
Don't involve me in that matter.
I'll miss you all.
Tom made one last attempt.
Do you still have a key?
Tom went downstairs.
Tom looked at his compass.
I have a Canadian neighbor.
I spend as much time working in the garden in one day as my brother does in a week.
I'm just trying to get Tom's attention.
Can you help me with my homework?
Tom played tennis.
I'll rent a car.
Can you afford it?
Are you sure we're doing the right thing?
I wonder why Tom is late.
It's very difficult to explain.
Tom knows what he needs to do.
I often stay up all night.
French is one of the languages that I speak.
I was just trying to be polite.
I switched the microphone off.
They exhausted all the resources of the country.
The older children helped the younger ones.
"Listen, I need to see you."
You'll soon get used to Japanese food.
You're so lazy.
They told me to stay in the car.
Tom told me he's getting married.
I've already ordered.
I'm pleasantly surprised by that.
Where did you get these clothes?
I didn't give anything to Tom.
You already know the answer.
It's cloudier today than yesterday.
English is not my mother tongue.
Have you ever milked a cow?
He advised her to stop drinking.
I remember when it happened.
You should give Tom some time.
I can't find my lip gloss.
Please pardon me for coming late.
Where is your homework?
I don't have Tom's number.
He tried to kill himself.
I destroyed everything.
You need a drink.
How much water do we have left?
I will explain the situation to you later on.
Go away. I don't want to see you.
Would you mind if I told Tom?
Japan is the best country under the sun.
Tom hasn't seen the picture yet.
Don't put sugar in my coffee.
Can you tell me how you get to the American Embassy?
We can't turn back.
What were you and Tom doing?
Can you answer?
This is the calm before the storm.
Violence against anyone is unacceptable.
I knew you'd do that.
Will you see Tom next month?
That tree looks dead.
Tom and Mary watched a documentary about squirrels.
Tom settled into his new job quickly and soon became a valued member of the team.
Tom is bossy.
She didn't show up at the party yesterday.
Tom ran toward the house.
Tom always liked me.
None of us like Tom.
I don't want you to come back to Boston.
I know that I'm dying.
Tom wants his father to buy him a pony.
Be ruthless.
You can delete that now.
Do you work for Tom?
We hope there won't be any bloodshed.
We could do that if we tried.
Tom noticed that Mary was staring at him.
My house is between Tom's and Mary's.
Look to your left.
I don't want to know anything.
They both blushed.
I need a drink first.
Her goal is to become a teacher.
Are there any poisonous snakes around here?
I didn't betray you.
Do you really want Tom to win?
It's a very quiet room.
I had absolutely no idea what to do.
When did you get out of jail?
Why are you still smiling?
Tom ignored all my warnings.
What is your earliest memory from childhood?
I love this picture.
I'm not going to Boston this year.
I think Tom should go.
Tom likes watching TV in the evening.
You have such a beautiful name.
How did you fracture your shoulder?
I'm glad you thought of that.
You look like a girl.
"There are birds singing in the cage, aren't there?"
"Strangely enough, I didn't feel any pain at all."
Why don't you just talk to Tom?
Is it too late?
I don't think that I've ever seen you this happy before.
Nobody is here.
How could you humiliate me like that?
Talk to your boss.
"For goodness' sake, don't say that!"
I've been trying to fix that.
Mary slapped Tom.
Tom is sitting on the wall.
Please don't smoke in bed.
"Everyone left, except for us."
Tom wouldn't have to do that.
I know that Tom is cold.
I don't blame you a bit.
I had no idea it would put you to so much trouble.
I like the way you do that.
You've got a lot to learn.
He is smelling the soup.
When did man start to use tools?
"Are you new, too?"
Tom should have known better than to kiss Mary in public.
Were you sick?
I love that show.
You're a brilliant photographer.
Can you add these numbers?
Tom is one of our clients.
My father lives in the country.
I want you to trust me.
How did all this start?
I knew that was going to happen.
I'm not happy about it.
Look at all those birds.
We must prevent war at any cost.
Tom spoke only French.
I am certain that he will quit his job.
"From this point, we'll go on foot."
I want to know who's coming with us.
This is for my friend.
Tom is hoping you'll win.
I'm sure I can find Tom.
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn't drink anymore.
Tom doesn't want to be a diplomat.
What were you doing at that time?
I know Tom won't believe me.
Thanks for helping with dinner.
She has lived with us since last summer.
Tom said that Mary wasn't upset.
Help me pick out a tie to go with this suit.
I know it's a surprise.
I want you to behave yourself.
I didn't know you were so tired.
"At the most, the trip will cost $1,000."
I don't feel like going to school today.
I've nothing to give.
"If you go, I'll go, too."
No one knows yet.
You must not discuss this with anyone.
Let me get you something cold to drink.
It happened here.
You must break the vicious circle.
I'm not hurt.
We're Tom's daughters.
Who do you think it is?
Tom left a long time ago.
Has the snow already melted?
Am I intruding?
I'm not kidding you. Some people actually believe that the world is only six thousand years old.
You look like you've just seen a ghost.
Tom told me it was Mary's fault.
Tom paused to gather his thoughts.
I haven't met him even once.
That's what's wrong with you.
I think you know who I'm talking about.
Would you like to be famous?
One of us is wrong.
Tom and I both started to laugh.
Tom has already been asked not to do that again.
Don't you know how dangerous it is to go swimming by yourself?
Tom pretended he was asleep.
My sister irons my pants.
I've decided to tell the truth.
I'd like to know where Tom hid his key.
You're braver than I am.
Tom was surprised to find Mary sitting all alone in the chapel.
Where is the nearest police station?
I remember that man's name very well.
They get what they deserve.
We have to buy it from abroad.
Do you think I'm too tall?
Our problems are nothing compared to hers.
It feels good to win.
Don't spoil your child.
Tom hadn't eaten anything the whole day and was hungry.
Why are you so wet?
Did you wash clothes yesterday?
"You recognize Tom, don't you?"
What do tigers eat?
Tom needs a blood transfusion.
I can't come with you.
"Where's his book? ""It's on the table."""
Today is a very special day.
A storm kept the ship from leaving Kobe.
Are you pointing at me?
I've known that for a long time.
I kind of doubt that that actually happened.
Tom fell into the ditch.
She is aggressive.
They're all gone.
Did Tom know it?
I know you don't like sports.
I lied to protect you.
I don't know how Tom found out.
I can give you a lift if you like.
I know exactly what Tom is up to.
"I live in Boston now, but I come from Chicago."
Didn't you write a letter to him?
Tom has been accused of murder.
We're back together.
Tom wants to see you and me.
I suggest you leave.
I can tell you how to do that.
Tom is the only one who had to do that.
I'm no longer afraid of dogs.
What did you eat last night?
Tom likes talking about himself.
I want you to take me with you.
Tom became rich.
Tom insisted that I go there with Mary.
I can't blame you for that.
Write your name in pencil.
What do you like to do?
His name is very difficult to remember.
I went up the stairs.
It was difficult to tell if Tom was in his room.
Tom didn't tell me anything.
Tom often jogs before breakfast.
Love is crazy.
Tom comes here every other month.
Where can I advertise for a used car?
Tom sold the necklace to Mary for a very low price.
Tom tried to leave.
I got up an hour earlier than I usually do.
Tom stuck his fingers in his ears.
Don't believe anything that Tom says.
Good advice isn't always expensive.
Tom looked as if he hadn't shaved for a week.
I succeeded.
I knew I'd be busy today.
Tom will be leaving soon.
I never got to finish my lunch.
I think it's necessary for him to go there.
Don't make the same mistakes I made.
Do you like tennis?
Do you want me to tell you why?
Tom is hungry and thirsty.
We are husband and wife.
There is a bench under the tree.
He has made me what I am.
"You don't know how to do it, do you?"
I don't think I can eat all this.
Aren't you Catholic?
Poetry is my passion.
I don't ride my bicycle very often.
I won't get in your way.
I have the list.
Tom Jackson's book has been translated into many languages.
I don't come back here very often.
Tom is feeling trapped.
Now you know why.
His health is improving little by little.
I just did what you asked me to do.
You were my life.
Tom's pulse is normal.
Tell me where you're going.
Tom saw them kissing.
Have I convinced you?
Tom asked us to wait until he got here.
Haven't you finished eating yet?
Tell me what you've heard.
Gamblers enjoy taking risks.
Dogs are man's best friends.
We have put the Christmas presents under the tree.
Does Tom have to work on Saturdays?
You deserve to know the truth.
There are three boxes on the table.
Tom certainly impressed the judges.
Give Tom a chair.
We're doing fine.
What department do you work for?
Did Tom see you?
I saw the cat.
Tom never was disobedient.
I knew that Tom wouldn't win.
He's crazy about her.
Tom wanted to rent a car.
The taxi is waiting outside.
Tom didn't have anything to do.
Tom is at church right now.
I will see him at the first opportunity.
I have a bruise.
She handed him the money.
Could you please tell Tom I need to talk to him?
Tell me a story.
How did you find out where Tom lives?
Is Tom still in the hospital?
Do you know Tom's secret?
You need to apologize to Tom.
I walk across that bridge every morning on the way to school.
That part is good.
The crowd was silent.
Tom wants a word with you.
I can't continue doing this.
Tom told me that he was busy.
I'm educated.
I think we should keep an eye on Tom.
She has a natural talent for music.
I believe that he's trustworthy.
You're scaring Tom.
Keep away from here.
I can prove it to you.
It was just your imagination.
I don't think that anyone's going to help you.
I need to go shopping.
I was thinking about it.
Tom said he doesn't know Mary.
"Wait a moment, please."
It is under the chair.
It is difficult to ascertain what really happened.
He was fed up with life in the city.
Do I look old?
That's the tough part.
I hang out with Tom quite often.
I recognised him immediately.
I've asked you several times not to do that.
Don't talk that way.
Hats are coming into fashion.
I noticed that this morning.
I learned my lesson.
Your pulse is normal.
I'm only happy when Tom is here.
What do you want Tom to do?
I desperately need a car.
Tom came to Mary's birthday party.
Do you prefer red or white wine?
I don't want to do that either.
Tom doesn't really like Mary.
Tell Tom you're sick.
You're just lying.
She understands him.
I haven't written anything.
The meeting is scheduled for 10 a.m.
I suspect Tom is the one who stole the money.
The policeman caught him by the arm.
How did the presentation go?
He convinced me of his innocence.
I've won first prize!
They kissed again.
I thought that you were Canadian.
The palace has a tall tower.
That's why I'm still alive.
Tom wanted to become a scientist.
Tom thinks he's invincible.
Tom killed the tiger.
My father's hobby is fishing.
I have nothing you want.
They have a lot of confidence in Tom's ability.
Tom poured Mary a glass of water.
How dare you do that to me!
You're asking the wrong person.
I've decided not to help you anymore.
He can't afford to have his reputation hurt.
Are you hungry now?
John Adams took office in 1797.
Tom comes here once a month.
How could you stand that?
Look at this.
I'm glad you weren't here.
I said that I would help him.
I think Tom is going to be pretty mad when he finds out that the painting he bought is a fake.
I want to disappear.
My father will come home at seven.
Tom put some branches into the wood chipper.
Let's leave early.
"Tell me what's wrong, Tom."
Tom thought Mary wanted to quit doing that.
He turned pale at the news.
Tom doesn't have a sister.
Do you need them?
You should've asked me to do that.
I wonder why Tom refused to do that.
Tom and Mary played a game of Russian roulette.
Tom was really tired.
Everybody laughed at me.
I need a job.
What are your instincts telling you?
Do you think I should cook for Tom?
Get out of there as soon as possible.
Do you want me to wait here?
My boss is an idiot.
Tom saw Mary walking to the bus stop and ran to catch up with her.
I have a friend whose father is an animal doctor.
Tom said Mary was happy.
Are you from around here?
The weatherman predicts snow for tonight.
"If you have something to say to me, say it."
He didn't pay attention to what she said.
This is all we can give you.
Tom hadn't expected it to be like this.
What time should I go to the airport?
Why do you think Tom likes chess so much?
Start again.
My grandfather doesn't drive anymore.
Are there books on the table?
What is this animal called in Japanese?
"Finally, my father compromised."
Why don't we all go?
I got one for Christmas.
Now ten dollars buys less than five dollars did three years ago.
I don't know how I can help you.
Tom sat down on the couch.
Tom told me how to do that.
Set the lamp on the table.
I have seen her before.
The door opened automatically.
That's probably why I'm still single.
Tom bought a new suit.
I advise you to listen to your doctor.
"If Tom wasn't so stupid, he would've understood quicker."
It was Tom who told Mary to do that.
I can teach you if you want.
That was ideal.
You can't stop Tom.
"I was born in Australia, but I grew up in New Zealand."
No one suspected you.
Where are you now?
"If I had enough money, I could do that."
"The months with the most rain are May, June, July and August."
"You're not afraid of heights, are you?"
Why did you buy that expensive dictionary?
He made a mistake.
You may take either of the two books.
You can call me Tom if you want.
Peel the bananas and mash them with a fork.
I've never seen one like that.
Mary is cooking stew and Tom is making a salad.
How did you know I grew up in Boston?
He exchanged yen for dollars.
Tom must've been worried.
You don't have to hide your feelings.
Did you sign it?
Is the lake deep?
Tom is crying.
I'm not trying to lose weight.
I want to move to Australia.
We have no choice but to go.
It'll be beautiful.
Are you sure you can do that?
How about going to the movies?
Tom read all these books in one week.
I have bad news.
Where did you hide?
How can you be so optimistic about the future?
I was stupid enough to believe Tom.
I feel very sorry for him.
I am proud to be a part of this project.
The police have called off the search.
Tom did badly at school.
Tom has always been more interested in science than art.
We need to be prudent.
I need to have a talk with you.
I asked Tom where he wanted to go.
I was so happy.
I know that Tom has already left Australia.
I have to go to the men's room.
I know all that.
What's your favorite holiday?
He asked about the others.
Are Tom and Mary really engaged?
Tom has a picture of his family on his desk.
Tom wants to know when you're coming.
It is out of the question.
We found a nail stuck in the tire.
Tom glanced at me.
I'm really sleepy.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
You shouldn't have paid the bill.
It looks like Tom and Mary aren't going to get married.
"This time, you've gone too far."
I only have one blanket.
The play was so boring that Tom and I both fell asleep.
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
Tom makes a lot more money than I do.
I wasn't very worried.
It was harder than I thought it would be.
Tom drank a glass of orange juice.
The ball rolled down the hill.
Are we safe now?
I forgot your phone number.
This is unbearable.
Tom might need to help Mary.
I've just eaten so I'm not hungry.
You should go home.
Do you want to come in?
Please tell me where to go next.
You've done it!
I'll send you the link.
He's a volleyball player.
I'm yours.
Tell me what you said to Tom.
I am writing you at the request of a friend.
I'm part owner of this restaurant.
I met Tom when I was in Boston.
I've never seen Tom wearing a tie.
I consulted a doctor.
What do you think Tom will say?
I don't think that Tom ate all the bananas.
The speed of the spread of AIDS is horrifyingly fast.
They already left.
You'll be with me.
You can't sing here.
I have an important message for Tom.
I hope you like this gift.
What a hot day it is!
These are Mary's earrings.
I was asked to be quiet.
Tom didn't plan to do that.
This is a long list.
You remind me of myself.
Did he do such things?
Please write your name here.
I've decided not to go to Boston with you.
"Time, which strengthens friendship, weakens love."
I can't live in this house anymore.
Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance you must keep moving.
Tom neglected his duties.
We'll be broke soon if we don't stop spending money on things we don't need.
I didn't know that this would happen.
He does everything very quickly.
Tom went back to bed.
We can't make Tom do something he doesn't want to do.
Tom felt someone touch his arm.
Tom often plays tennis after school.
Where do you keep your textbooks?
My father tries to abstain from drinking.
How did you get my number?
Why are people scared of me?
I am not as interested in literature as you.
"I lived in Japan for 2 years, but now I'm living in California."
I hope all your dreams come true.
I'd like you to postpone your trip.
"Frankly, I find that hard to believe."
Why did you open that door?
Haven't we met before?
Why are you so happy today?
Do it tomorrow.
Tom is moved.
He asked me to go to a movie with him.
I was absolutely stunned.
You have to help Tom with his homework.
I can't let you drive.
The car crashed because the driver was careless.
It's not your fault.
"As soon as the child saw his mother, he stopped crying."
Tom and Mary aren't smiling.
I wasn't sure what that meant.
"You never help Tom, do you?"
I can come back if you want me to.
We have been having awful weather.
Tom is very upset with Mary.
I think that Tom is weird.
I didn't expect this question.
I'm falling.
You're my age.
Someone is playing the piano.
Tom plays soccer every day after school.
Tom came a day too late.
My father doesn't allow me to go to the movies alone.
Tom wants someone to help Mary.
Tom bought a new pair of skis.
Let me go to the store.
Do not be shy. Your pronunciation is more or less correct.
Can I give you a hand?
You don't smile much.
It will be winter before long.
He arrived in time.
Don't come out here.
"Is Tom afraid? ""No, I don't think so."""
You're probably doing it wrong.
Tom doesn't understand me.
Tom is going to have a lot more questions than we do.
I know your face.
Does Tom know about it?
Did you hide it somewhere?
I'm in trouble because of you.
Tell them to give it to you.
I'm not as young as Tom thinks I am.
It's really Tom.
"Puns are very hard, if not impossible, to translate."
Appearances can be deceiving.
What did you just say to Tom?
Computers make calculations.
I thought I'd always be alone.
What a beautiful sunset!
Pack up the bags. We're going back to Boston.
When are you going to tell Tom about what happened?
He was present at the meeting.
Tom has been talking to Mary about me.
Are you sure you've never met Tom?
Do you have time?
I woke up with a headache.
Tom told me not to tell you anything.
Can you determine what happened?
That's news to me.
I still have the umbrella you lent me.
"Is this yours, Tom?"
I still haven't apologized to Tom.
I'm very shocked.
She abandoned her children.
Tom said Mary was blackmailing him.
How many days are there until your birthday?
Nobody taught me.
Tom said that you were there.
The post office is just across from the store.
He has gone to Britain.
No one knew that except Tom.
I don't want to go home.
You promised that you wouldn't drink today.
That's the most absurd idea I've ever heard.
I only hope that the rain holds off for a few hours more.
Have a little patience.
I suspect that Tom is the one who stole the money.
Tom says he won't have time to do that.
There are no tables in the room.
We play football every Saturday.
I borrow money.
I just hope it's not too late.
I'm not old.
We've both been very busy.
A caravan of fifty camels slowly made its way through the desert.
We know where it is.
Tom admitted that he wasn't sure.
Tom has begun to learn French.
There were a lot of cars on the street.
I helped Tom do his homework.
I'm so glad you're home.
I'm helping you.
Don't look at it.
Don't panic!
That's never happened to us before.
I'm not sure Tom wants to go there.
I always have to wear a tie because of my job.
It was in 1950 that he was born.
It's really very annoying.
Is your daughter here?
I'm sure you'll be able to do that.
Stand up straight.
Tom began to eat.
Are you alive?
Tom is a dependable man.
Don't you have a dictionary?
Can I walk you home?
I can't do any more than this.
Tom said that Mary would do that as well.
Nobody really knows what happened.
I guess you will be very busy tonight.
Tom gave me a ride home.
I thought that you said that Tom needed more time.
His vote would decide the issue.
Tom carried both suitcases.
Who did you give it to?
Tom wasn't supposed to help Mary do that.
Tom probably went out.
Do you want me to wait?
I agreed with Tom.
"Having been brought up in America, my father speaks English fluently."
They saw they had no choice.
I was a pretty good clarinetist when I was younger.
Tom and Mary love each other.
Just relax a minute.
Where did I put it?
Tom spent all morning cleaning his room.
We thank you for your generous support.
We left by train.
"Five days later, President Taylor died."
I really can't talk about this.
It's as deep as it is wide.
Tom's paternal grandparents live in Australia.
The crowd dispersed quickly.
They are much younger than Tom.
You're very shy.
She is no beauty.
We haven't found anything yet.
Did you really not know that?
I heard a loud explosion.
Are you armed?
She does not smoke.
You should study French harder.
I'd like to work with Tom.
You can't stop me.
Tom has nothing to be afraid of.
I think that I know as much as you.
He told me how to play chess.
I would've done that anyway.
When was the last time you went fishing with Tom?
Do you want to play with Tom?
I forget your telephone number.
Tom is a real wimp.
I gave up trying to lose weight years ago.
You know I hate spinach.
What did you and your friends talk about?
Why doesn't he tell the truth?
You will die.
Tom will never allow you to do that.
Tom already knows that.
Please forget I said that.
This bucket has a bullet hole in it.
Wait for me. I'll be back.
Didn't you know Tom and Mary were married?
They're not always right.
She has a cold.
Of course Tom will go.
I have four times more CDs than you do.
Ask Tom yourself.
Where is the judge?
I didn't call you.
I'd like to be alone if you don't mind.
It all depends on Tom.
Cut the cloth diagonally.
Tom took out his gun.
Why did she do it?
He presented me with a bouquet of flowers.
"It's a small noisy apartment, but it's where I live and I call it home."
I couldn't answer.
Bend your knees.
I want to hear your version of what happened.
Did you sign the contract?
All the students have gone home.
May I use this pencil?
I guess Tom is looking for Mary.
I didn't even know you had a horse.
Tom waited a while to let his eyes adjust to the darkness.
Did you see anything unusual?
I'm an eighth-grade science teacher in Boston.
Why can't you tell me?
Please excuse me.
It looks like today will be a long day.
Tom was determined to make the football team.
We thought you were in danger.
Does Tom know all this?
Is the electrical equipment grounded?
Those shoes are old fashioned.
What else did you have?
Tom isn't going anywhere this afternoon.
I enjoy spending time with you.
You were eavesdropping.
We're going to be here all afternoon.
You look sad today.
It was hard for me to convince Tom to do that.
Tom went outside to smoke a cigarette.
Tom heard a helicopter overhead.
I would like you to introduce me to her.
We're in the same class.
You need to rest. Try to go to sleep.
Where did Tom find it?
She was moved to tears by the story.
Show them what you can do.
It still happens from time to time.
I play piano.
Why didn't you tell me that earlier?
I tear my clothes when I work in the garden.
I don't think anyone can do that.
They abandoned their homeland.
Thanks for helping us do that.
Where did you learn to do this?
I knew from the beginning that you never really loved me.
I'm perfectly happy.
I'm worried about Tom's health.
I'm on your side.
When do I get there?
"Which city is larger, Boston or Chicago?"
Let me look.
I'm untidy.
There isn't much furniture in my house.
Tom asked Mary to kiss him.
"I didn't know that you'd come, too."
I don't want to tell him.
I'm sure I'll do that.
This homework is difficult for me.
I'm glad you waited for me.
Let's talk about what happened yesterday.
Are there survivors?
Tom looked really busy.
That water pipe leaks.
I'm planning to visit Boston next year.
Leave me alone!
Do I know you?
I'm pudgy.
A man can be happy with any woman as long as he doesn't love her.
I want to return to Boston.
"In general, Japanese are hardworking."
Don't be so shy.
I want to sit by the window.
We must cancel our trip to Japan.
That lake looks like an ocean.
I took my revenge.
The girl got distracted and lost sight of her parents.
What time do you think you'll likely arrive?
I'm much more experienced than you are.
Are you going to cut down all the trees?
Tom has been saving money to buy a car.
He's a little pale.
I will meet you at the station at 10 p.m.
Can I borrow yours?
I know you have children.
I was in bed already.
Did Tom eat dessert?
I told you not to go by yourself.
"If this happens again, call me."
There's a package for you.
I'm very grateful to you for your help.
It's too small.
I think that Tom will be bored.
I think she is the kindest woman on earth.
I think you look fine.
"No matter what you say, I will never believe you."
Why are you wearing those?
I can't drive.
"You don't know how to do it, do you?"
Do you have a bank account?
Did you call a doctor?
We've been sitting here for almost an hour.
Tom said that he needed more time.
I was assaulted.
Her writing is very good.
I changed my shirt.
Violence must be eradicated.
I'm not fussy.
I grabbed Tom by the elbow.
I wonder why Tom was in my room.
It's not an easy task.
I will go there by plane.
How are your children?
I don't need a nap.
It was a great loss.
She sold him her car.
Tom has three sisters.
What makes you think I can do that?
How did you come up with such a good excuse?
Tom fixed the broken radio.
The plane dropped bombs on the city.
Tom isn't in Boston anymore.
I know I can do this.
Tom will want to read this report.
You can't do that.
Tom rested.
I no longer need it.
I don't think that Tom is wrong.
Tom bought that pair of shoes at a clearance sale.
Mary bought a new dress for the party.
Tom is a happy man.
Tom is stark naked.
We have an appointment.
What did you want to ask me?
I heard you got married.
There were a lot of girls at the party.
I'll take a nap after lunch.
You shouldn't tell anyone about this.
"Personally, I think you're right."
Let's hope the situation doesn't get any worse.
You two come with me.
It's a huge gamble.
This painting was expensive.
You'll get fired if you don't do that.
You need to eat healthier food.
"If you don't want this, I'll give it to someone else."
Introduce me to your friend.
Take a closer look.
I like that dress better than this one.
Can you prove it?
She has never fallen in love.
Why is Tom so scared?
A cat has two ears.
She stood by him whenever he was in trouble.
I knew we should've left earlier.
Tom thought only of Mary.
"It's cool this morning, isn't?"
We're going to the beach. Would you like to go with us?
Tom never reached Australia.
I wasn't wearing a lifejacket.
That wouldn't help.
Those were difficult times.
I'm sorry that I was late. It won't happen again.
I'm just glad no one was killed.
Tom wants a motorcycle.
Tom knocked again.
You got lucky today.
Where did you sleep last night?
I've dislocated my shoulder.
I never promised you anything.
Just trust me.
I thought it was a great idea.
I suspect Tom won't help Mary do that anymore.
I don't plan on retiring yet.
Let's throw a party.
Something is still not right.
Tom took the wrong bus.
Tom wants to talk with you.
Tom concealed the fact that he had been in prison.
They just announced that on the radio.
I'm looking forward to the New Year holidays.
You said it yourself.
We waited three hours.
Tom said he's sure Mary can win.
We're watching a movie.
Tom would like to speak to you in private.
The fire spread quickly.
I work as a bus driver.
Many admire him.
She knows she does not have any other choices.
I need you to do that right away.
We all knew what the risks were when we volunteered.
I thought you had a date.
Don't start anything you can't finish.
Where did you put my notebook?
Don't you have anything to say?
One cannot embrace the unembraceable.
I thought you might need it.
Tom is a good boss.
"As far as I know, she hasn't left yet."
Neither motorcyclist was wearing a helmet.
You can go there if you want.
Tom decided not to tell Mary.
Maybe that's a good idea.
Tom spoke with Mary on the phone.
She is getting worse and worse every day.
Wait for us here.
I hope that you aren't afraid.
The lawn is still too wet to mow.
I think you resemble your mother.
How do we reason with Tom?
Tom is a very good storyteller.
I didn't see exactly what happened.
We don't do it very often.
I found out something interesting today.
Everyone must memorize these words.
It's not a competition.
Tom saw a deer.
Tom is my twin brother.
Tom took something out of his pocket.
I don't know much about your family.
Why are you so angry today?
Tom and Mary are now eating lunch.
We'll visit you sometime.
Call me after you talk to Tom.
I tried again.
Is this your phone?
Tom almost got hit by a car.
I'm not a magician.
I know you want to go to sleep.
"The French flag is blue, white and red."
Tom is like my own son.
The story about the girl was in the news.
Can you make me a copy?
All of them are from Iceland.
Tom didn't say a word all evening.
The bus was ten minutes late.
The lights in the bathroom aren't working.
Do you have any money?
Are you still bored?
Keeping a diary also gives us a chance to reflect on our daily life.
I know what this means.
We can't fish there anymore.
Tom is very neat.
"If Tom is right, Mary is in Boston now."
I learned a new word today.
I'm just stating the obvious.
He doesn't seem to want to get ahead.
Who invited you guys?
Tom has a lot of hard work ahead of him.
I cleared the roof of snow.
Taking off is easier than landing.
Everybody wants one.
I don't think Tom believed us.
I was very hungry.
She used to date him.
Tom was the one who took this picture.
I think Tom dyes his hair.
I bet I get there before you.
I suspect you don't have to do that.
You shouldn't wait here.
Tom lay on the ground.
Give Tom the key.
We hope you come back home soon.
We have to figure out where Tom hid his money.
What were you doing when I saw you?
It would cost twice as much as that.
I can explain.
Tom tried to get rid of the ants.
"Tom wants you to buy him a ticket, too."
Tom opened his desk drawer.
I never liked Tom.
She waited for you for two hours.
Tom cried like a three-year-old.
This is going to hurt a bit.
It's very cold here in January.
I'm successful.
I shrugged.
Tom started coughing.
I think I'll snooze for a while.
We're here to help you.
I don't think Tom knows very much about Boston.
I didn't go because Tom told me not to.
"Some superstitious people in America believe that if a black cat crosses your path, you'll have bad luck."
Tom and Mary wanted to travel together.
I'm busy doing homework.
She wanted him to say that he loved her.
Can you tell me what it means?
Are you ambitious?
I dug a pit.
I think you'll regret it if you don't go with us.
I've left Boston already.
Tom should've known this.
People who drink alcoholic beverages are not allowed to enter.
I'm just sitting here relaxing.
They called them traitors.
Do you promise?
Many of my friends study French.
I gave that to Tom.
Tom has family in the Boston.
I've seen you on TV.
Does your back still hurt?
Different people tell different versions of the incident.
You blame Tom for everything.
I'd like you to come with us.
Tom didn't tell Mary the whole truth.
I do have a plan.
I work part-time.
That's what interests me.
Don't come in here.
Tom is looking for you.
All you had to do was ask and I would've lent you as much money as you needed.
I know what it means.
This is too difficult for me.
I'm dining out this evening.
Tom is an honest boy.
She sang pretty well.
This dog runs fast.
Don't be shy.
Please remember to water the garden.
Do you think Tom would help Mary do that?
I suggest you wait until 2:30.
My aunt had three kids.
He's very talented.
Tom is a loser.
I must have this.
A young girl on crutches asked Tom where he lived.
We aren't as rich as Tom is.
What was the name of that movie?
I stayed home all day.
She was fond of poetry and music.
"Not far from the village, a shell exploded."
I was negligent.
Wait till they open fire.
I'll be ready by 2:30.
How lucky I am!
My father graduated from Harvard University.
Tom is only pretending to be sick.
Do you like to drink beer?
Tom said you wouldn't come.
Are you afraid of the future?
I don't want to embarrass you in front of your friends.
You lied to Tom and me.
I rescheduled.
Tom hasn't had supper yet.
Don't be a coward.
I can't accept your apology.
"As you know, I've lost my job, so I'm having trouble making ends meet."
Do you have anything for a headache?
"I was listening to my iPod, so I didn't hear the fire alarm."
The meeting began at nine o'clock sharp.
Each of the three boys got a prize.
I want to give him a present for his birthday.
Tom cringed in pain.
You made a fool of yourself.
I was one of the last to leave.
People make mistakes in a situation like this.
Can we play a little longer?
I thought you hated Australia.
Just forget it.
I'm here to apologize.
It was yesterday that I went.
Do you have a cellphone?
I don't watch television.
I never saw him before.
Tom pulled his sweater off.
Who cares what happens?
We need more workers like you and Tom.
I am poor at drawing.
I watched TV last night.
Don't call us.
Oil has been discovered under the North Sea.
It's pretty cold today.
Tom wasn't ready to die.
Nagoya is a city famous for its castle.
I wasn't looking.
Jesus loves you.
You were unconscious.
I know a woman whose first and last names are the same as mine.
I fell asleep in class.
The air conditioner doesn't work.
I thought that you had plans.
I broke it.
There is some truth in that.
I think we're OK.
Get lost.
We were grateful.
Do you realize that?
I met with Tom earlier today.
I don't know how to help you.
Tom thought about what Mary had told him.
I regret having told you.
Do you want it now?
Astronomy is by no means a new science.
I didn't even get an invitation.
Business is booming.
She asked for your help.
Tom didn't tell us the truth.
Where can I reach you?
Will you help me with my English homework?
Thank you so much for doing this.
The cat is under the chair.
I don't think that I need to go.
You've frightened Tom.
Bring me some water.
"Great weather, isn't it?"
Tom pleaded not guilty.
I didn't know you used to live in Boston.
I'll give you a new one.
Where's the kitchen?
When were you planning to tell Tom?
I won't bother you.
Did you find out what went wrong?
We have an orange tree.
When was the last time you went to Boston?
Tom is a pirate.
"If you could come, I'd be really happy."
We've done almost everything you've asked for.
It seems like you know everything already.
What do you think about Tom?
Best wishes from all of us.
"If you want your workers to be happy, you need to pay them a decent wage."
Why doesn't Tom want to go to Boston?
I asked Tom to wake me up at 2:30.
Tom likes the idea.
We love you very much.
The cash machine is out of order.
Their daughter is a nurse.
I haven't seen Tom this morning.
Is that what I think it is?
I'm crazy.
I know you stole it.
French in my favorite language.
Have you seen Tom's new car?
I have expected his death for six months.
You need to get off at the next station.
I didn't want to go back home.
I think this is ridiculous.
Tom asked me to open the window.
Why do you give Tom money?
Tom is very photogenic.
He dumped me.
I like what I do.
Our bad luck was temporary.
Tom and Mary weren't invited to John's party.
Tom is doing nothing wrong.
He is unpopular for some reason.
I can't leave yet.
I'll be careful with the kids.
Tom is probably still in his room.
How disgusting!
Why are people scared of Tom?
"Hello, how's business?"
This is my horse.
You were Tom's only friend.
We won't forget you.
I don't want to see it.
Lightning never strikes twice in the same place.
Tom broke Mary's heart.
I like walking.
Tom phoned from a neighbor's house.
You've done a good job.
I couldn't resist the temptation.
Pollution is a serious problem.
I'll never forgive you for that.
I asked him where I could park my car.
You're so handsome.
The meaning of this sentence is obscure.
Won't you come to the party tomorrow?
Tom is likely older than Mary.
Tom became very good at it.
It's the same here.
Everybody knows me.
Is it true that you breast-fed all your children?
The door is open.
Tom can help you find what you're looking for.
I see you've found your book.
Tom told me a story.
Why are all these people here?
You're next.
I bet that Tom won't agree to do that.
Do you know Tom's address?
Is Tom jealous?
I know that Tom likes Mary.
What are you doing for New Year's Eve?
Tom has a blog.
What does the earth look like from space?
Tom likes swimming.
Tom told me that he didn't love Mary anymore.
Don't be such a crybaby.
I thought Tom had left.
Don't you ever give your dog a bath?
"Jack of all trades, master of none."
Were you one of them?
"If Tom had seen anything, he would have told us."
Are you surprised that I came?
I pretended to be listening.
Have you ever been shot?
I know that Tom is claustrophobic.
Tom doesn't know where to put that.
Tom wouldn't speak French to me.
You got some white stuff on your boots.
Are your kids still living with you?
Just go back home.
Tom wants me to stay for a couple of weeks.
Friends are like flowers in the garden of life.
You spend too much time in front of your computer.
I learned how to swim when I was a kid.
Did Tom say how long Mary would be in Boston?
I think it's time for us to come to an agreement.
I'm sure Tom is mad at me.
Were you in Australia with Tom?
Didn't you know Mary was Tom's cousin?
That's reasonable.
Do you like the apple pie?
I want to know what it is.
Let me show you how to do that.
How complex is it?
I'm afraid of cats.
He went to sleep at six o'clock and he is still sleeping.
You don't have a clue.
My eyes get tired very easily.
I have been busy this week.
How long have you been here?
Tom hates secrets.
Tom had a hard time finding work.
I can't go with you.
I know you're not like that.
Tom told me that I'm boring.
We both know that's not true.
Just tell me what you saw.
Tom found a job for me.
I hope Tom follows your instructions.
I talk to Tom a lot.
Be sure to put it back in the same place.
Tom has promised to go to Boston with us.
Go to the store.
"Tom didn't use to like red wine, but now he drinks it almost every day."
What'll you wear?
Are you growing a beard?
Show me the location of your camp on this map.
I think I'll wait.
She blushed.
He is a strange person.
That's what's important.
Now is your chance.
That's all I can tell you for now.
I haven't been home since October.
I trust him.
Tom isn't much of a violinist.
You'll always be my best friend.
I told Tom to stay indoors.
Tom was tipsy.
Tom told me nothing.
Apples are cheap today.
I was in a car accident.
Tom unlocked the door for Mary.
"Many women pursue higher education and careers, thus delaying marriage and childbirth."
He was walking ahead of the car.
I'm not good at French.
I was the only one who survived.
There's often a simple solution to what seems like a complicated problem.
I wish I could speak French better.
Tom nudged Mary.
This is going to take forever.
He fell under the suspicion of the police.
Are you sure your parents will allow you to go?
Tom thanked Mary.
Do you really think I can do that?
Let's go to bed.
The zoo isn't far from here.
He was underwater for three minutes.
There's a little time before the train departs.
We should go.
The knife is dirty.
When will the concert be held?
Tom is obviously very upset.
Come the day after tomorrow.
You can't sleep more than 24 hours a day.
I want you out of here now.
I know why you're sad.
Do you love your mother?
Go get some sleep.
I haven't paid for it yet.
Tom is mumbling something.
Tom is younger than you.
"If you've got something to say, say it."
Do you work on Monday?
It's a dangerous world.
How much milk do you want?
Tom sensed danger.
Tom is a person who can be trusted.
He hopes that something interesting happens.
You are all diligent.
We're both very hungry.
Tom is a healthy person.
Don't erase the board.
I was really disappointed when I found out that I hadn't passed the exam.
I want to see my son.
Helsinki is the capital of Finland.
I heard that it's going to rain tomorrow.
"If I were you, I'd buy that one."
I don't smell anything.
He will come if you call him.
Give me the details.
I wasn't as lucky as Tom was.
I'll try to be home early.
Mary wants to be treated like a princess.
Tom had blood on his shoes.
Never open the door of a car that is in motion.
They won't find you.
We want to help you.
That is how she learns English.
The negotiations failed.
Haven't you called the police yet?
Do you think that Tom will see me?
It isn't an urgent matter.
Didn't you know I'd never done that before?
Be more careful from now on.
This handkerchief is made of paper.
I don't understand why you don't want to do that.
It was three hours ago.
Tom isn't like you.
Tom has a cute girlfriend.
I have to water the flowers.
Can I borrow your pen?
I don't want you to die.
Mary took off her dress.
How do we explain this to the kids?
I was worried about his health.
Let me introduce my wife.
The President's attempts to bring in stricter gun control laws have been thwarted time and time again by the powerful gun lobby.
I think that you are right.
"If I had a choice, I'd go home now."
Tom isn't stronger than me.
Do you want me to come in with you?
He lost the sight of one eye in a traffic accident.
We're having dinner.
Tom won't be able to help Mary today.
I am new here.
I never told Tom to do that.
They all look the same to me.
Do you really think Tom will win?
Nothing is missing.
Tom doesn't need money.
Tom was just a little boy at that time.
He stayed there a couple of days.
Tom doesn't do that anymore.
Tom doesn't care who wins.
I am glad to hear of your success.
I'm expecting visitors.
He did the work on his own.
Tom has changed a lot since then.
Tom is sure that he'll be able to pass the test.
What Tom told me helped a lot.
I have to put the kids to bed.
Where can I find a hospital?
The concert will start at 2:30.
Tom said he felt tired.
I feel sorry for Tom.
I still don't understand how to do that.
They drink too much.
It was a hot summer day.
That's a puzzle.
I want another beer.
Tom had a couple of suggestions.
Tom is always causing problems.
You can tell Tom anything you want.
"Tom is shorter than Mary, isn't he?"
I hope you find it interesting.
He used a headache as an excuse for leaving early.
Man is the only animal that laughs.
I'm not talking about you.
"Tom loved Mary, but she didn't like him at all."
Can we talk later?
I cannot afford to buy a new bicycle.
Tom is upset because he didn't get the raise he'd been promised.
Please remain seated.
Tom doesn't know how to handle children.
"Even though the accident was six months ago, my neck still hurts."
He makes it a rule to get up at six every morning.
Tom said you like popcorn.
Tom has already decided what he's going to buy.
I don't remember where I put my glasses.
We visited our father's grave.
Safety is an illusion.
We've probably made a mistake.
I don't eat as quickly as Tom does.
Tom came to my house yesterday.
Tom says that he's healthy.
I'm going to join the army.
This suitcase isn't as heavy as it looks.
You can go first.
He thinks of nothing but himself.
I have no idea how to do this.
Of course I remember you.
Tom interpreted for me.
Order me another one.
No one will believe him.
Write to Tom.
I knew you wouldn't come.
You looked guilty.
Did we win?
They need help.
I heard they're going to raise our rent.
I don't feel sorry for Tom.
Who wants it?
Tom looked ahead.
"The longer we waited, the more impatient we became."
Tom is volunteering.
Something funny is always happening in our class.
Everything is broken.
I told Tom Mary would help.
Tom and I've known each other a long time.
That's what I like.
They used local wood to build the ships.
You can stay only if you're quiet.
It wasn't mine.
She agreed with my idea.
I think your French has gotten a lot better.
Not even one taxi stopped.
Steel traps are illegal.
I don't think I needed to do that.
Wake me up at eight.
I thought you looked sad.
Put on your shoes.
Tom has freckles.
I had to be here yesterday.
Tom isn't going to help you.
Who do you think will win the race?
Did you hurt yourself?
She plays the piano.
Do you have a fishing license?
We talked quite frankly.
I studied French in Boston.
It's pretty unusual.
Tom stayed in bed because he wasn't feeling very well.
When are you going to leave?
"Tom and Mary walked out, leaving John alone."
Have you heard from him?
Aren't you going to kiss me?
Don't forget to take an umbrella in case it rains.
Things just haven't been the same since you left.
TV's boring today.
Your order has been canceled.
I'm not telling you to go alone.
We still don't know the truth.
Tom was the expedition leader.
Tom won't bite you.
Tom doesn't know who cried.
Tom wondered if Mary would slap him if he tried to kiss her.
May I be excused?
Do we have enough food for thirty people?
It only took an hour.
"Finally, the bell rang."
How do you know what color it is?
Tom doesn't want to work here.
Tom will do that somehow.
Tom has found something interesting.
Tom did fifty sit-ups.
Tom isn't as strong as you are.
I have no idea what it means.
Didn't you know Tom didn't have to do that?
Is Tom busy?
Tom is your heir.
Tom has never seen Mary smile.
I'd have done that if my parents had let me.
Why don't you play the banjo anymore?
"You aren't a spy, are you?"
I can't believe he did this to me.
Don't forget your promise.
I ran into the house.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
Tom and Mary had a nice time together.
Tom knew he was handsome.
Did you kiss Tom back?
You should come to Australia.
I don't think Tom would agree with you.
Everybody here knows that you don't eat pork.
I hope next year will be better.
I'm trying to be fair.
You have a lot to learn.
Was there an autopsy?
I couldn't wish for anything better.
Please speak English.
Have you ever donated blood?
He stays a long time every time he comes.
I don't have enough money on me right now to pay you what I owe you.
I don't regret it.
Why are you wearing my shoes?
You should read more.
Did you know that Tom was in Australia?
Are you planning to go there?
Do you want me to talk to Tom about what's going to happen?
I don't think that Tom is being reasonable.
How long are you here for?
He gave up his life for his country.
Tom poisoned himself.
The price includes tax.
Why don't you want to live in Boston?
Tom told me that he was very busy.
We can talk over lunch.
Don't you like anybody?
"If Tom knew how to swim, he'd probably want to go to the beach with us."
They're pretty good.
Why didn't you wait for Tom?
I'm older than you.
Are you still working in Boston?
Tom was surprised that Mary showed up.
I don't know her.
I wasn't being serious.
I'll help you clean your room.
The coffee is on me.
Should I include Tom?
My bicycle is in need of repair.
Tom committed suicide by hanging himself.
I saw the pictures Tom took last weekend.
Tom won't tell us anything about himself.
I fell asleep in class.
Do you want me to open the door for you?
But I was careful.
Tom goes to Boston once a year.
Tom gave me your number.
I didn't say I'd do that.
I want to dance with Mary.
It's in your bag.
Try to see things as they are.
We won't need it.
I got Tom a soccer ball for his birthday.
I don't think it would be hard to do that.
Tom hurt his knee when he fell down.
The streets are covered with snow.
Keep fighting.
We usually eat before seven.
Why are you waiting in line?
They're waiting outside.
"I received an invitation from Tom, but didn't accept it."
I wanted you to win.
What would you say to that?
I don't know how to say this in French.
You're ruining my whole plan.
Do you have brothers and sisters?
Return to your work.
What would you have said?
He is English.
Didn't you know I used to live in Boston?
You're the most beautiful woman I know.
Your o's look like a's.
Tom was up early.
We hugged each other and started crying.
I often ignore Tom's advice.
Tell Tom I know what's going on.
Are you happy with that?
Can you tell me why Tom is in Boston?
I heard you say that this morning.
They're going to find you.
I love apple cider.
"That doesn't really help us, does it?"
Do you know that girl's name?
I knew your father well.
Tom Jackson will be the new head of the company.
Tom was crying like a baby.
Our teacher speaks French as well as English.
Take this medicine if you don't feel well.
We went to a movie.
You're even taller than I am.
We'll start whenever you are ready.
Tom is here with me.
Where would you like to go?
We can see a church over there.
History is repeating itself again.
"I've never been to Boston, and Tom hasn't either."
I'm sure Tom will help you.
Tom will never go back to Boston.
Would you like to visit the city?
What kind of music do they play?
I don't have anything to throw.
Tom doesn't like to fly.
Tell me why you didn't do what I asked.
Tom hasn't paid us yet.
I was confused by the expression on her face.
I don't think I can do what you're asking me to do.
I know that Tom is drunk.
Tom and Mary talked about what they should do with the money.
Tom watched attentively.
That'll help me a lot.
I knew you wouldn't abandon me.
The prices remain as they were.
Who took my keys?
I hope you have a good lawyer.
"How do you feel? ""Better."""
Why do you want me to stop?
I like pizza.
He told me that he'd like to become a scientist.
Tom is one of my oldest friends.
Hide that book.
The cost of living has risen.
I just want to be alone right now.
You're invited.
He lay on the bed.
Go to the hospital.
I could hardly understand him.
Let's sit tight.
Tom said that he liked skiing.
She won't make it.
Tom told me to answer your questions.
Shame on you.
Tom won't let me help him.
I should have known better than to believe him.
I'm pleased with the result.
Can you tell me why you did that?
Do you still want to give me a hug?
I thought you were right.
Tom walked back to his hotel.
Take it upstairs.
You promised that you'd help me.
That's ridiculous!
Call me tomorrow afternoon.
I told Tom about what had happened.
He's too old.
Turn it on.
I am so exhausted!
Tom and Mary have made sandwiches.
The question before us is a hard one.
Would you like to leave a message for him?
We have to help.
I didn't call you stupid.
Tom exercised.
We're all very proud of you.
You must get up at six.
Did you see the way Tom was looking at you?
Do you want me to stop?
"Stand up and introduce yourself, please."
Do you still have my phone number?
You'll be surprised.
You must pay in advance.
I lost.
Look at that smoke.
Tom watered the tree he'd just transplanted.
We apologize.
Tom is particular.
Tom and Mary work hard.
Tom doesn't usually drink wine.
"How're you doing, Tom?"
I must report this to Tom.
Be there at noon.
I know you want to go home.
The door won't close.
Tom gave his seat to the old man.
You looked like you were busy.
I'm alone now.
What do you think they'll do?
Are you sure you don't want this?
You have a choice.
Don't ask.
We'll do everything we can.
I remember the night when I first saw the Milky Way.
We admire you.
What are you doing up this early?
It was strange.
I think Tom will want to talk to Mary about that.
Let me do that again.
All the eggs went bad.
I don't know anything about ballet.
It's technically possible.
I have a friend who is a pilot.
Is there any place around here where I can rent a bicycle?
You don't have to answer if you don't want to.
That man is definitely a bachelor.
I'm sure Tom won't forget Mary.
Do you live here alone?
That was an unforgivable error.
Why did you show Tom that?
Don't blame yourself for what happened.
I don't think Tom wants to see Mary.
She went to the train station to see him off.
I'd rather be watching TV.
I think this dictionary is useful for beginners.
Your shift ends at 2:30.
I haven't said anything.
What will you wear?
Why don't we sing together?
This is the hottest summer that we have had in thirty years.
What did he look like?
"If you had asked someone for directions, we'd be there already."
I don't think that Tom knows what Mary is doing now.
I'd like to hear a lot more about your trip.
You'll need a ticket to travel by bus.
Ask Tom to help.
I met one of your old boyfriends yesterday.
Can I leave now?
Why do you live here?
I'm probably going to have to leave work a little early today.
How many feet are there in a mile?
I don't mind anymore.
It won't be easy persuading Mary to go.
I hope you had a wonderful day.
Who is your friend?
They supplied us with food.
I caught two fish.
Don't take that tone of voice with me.
I know that it's inevitable.
It's partly your fault.
"Tom is very kind, just like you."
"I'm not always late, but I admit that I often am."
If I want your opinion I'll ask you for it.
Your ideas are a little old-fashioned.
Where did Tom learn French?
I'm glad you were here.
I hear you're moving to Australia.
Tom has no friends.
Can we go upstairs?
I bought this three years ago.
I don't think Tom is strange.
Tom is no more suspicious than anybody else.
"If I won the lottery, I'd buy you a car."
I want to eat ice cream.
Tom is not a very good driver.
"If you can't afford travel insurance, then you can't afford to travel."
Tom tried to hide his nervousness.
I didn't know which one I should buy.
Did you pass the exam?
I probably shouldn't have said anything.
Can I take a shower?
I shouldn't have told Tom.
"You're a teacher, right?"
I've already told you I don't want to do that.
Everybody likes squirrels.
I think you know why I can't do that.
"When I called on him, he was talking on the phone."
The word is no longer in use.
She is no less beautiful than her sister is.
I didn't tell Tom how many eggs to buy.
I'll get you some brandy.
You've spilled your coffee.
Tom considered himself lucky.
You can go there if you want.
How do you like your new school?
I've waited for it.
I'm glad you realize that.
I assure you this isn't just about money.
I can see you're working.
I wish you hadn't seen that.
I hope you're not afraid of the dark.
My dog ate it.
Tom said that Mary is mad.
I have to go to Boston.
Did you rent an apartment?
How many schools are there in your city?
I thought Tom wasn't afraid of anyone.
What is he like?
I wanted to be the first to congratulate you.
I think that we all have the same interests.
Have you ever seen an elephant fly?
Hang the mirror on the wall.
Why were you there?
Ask Tom about it when he comes.
Tom speaks French sometimes.
Guess how much that cost me.
Tom doesn't understand the value of money.
Stop acting like an idiot.
I've never hurt anyone.
I'll be in Boston next week.
My parents never punished me.
You're so impatient.
I can't believe Tom is already a sophomore.
My basement has nothing in it.
I'm sure that won't happen today.
They climbed down the tree.
I really like hanging out with you.
I felt terrible.
He's popular with the students.
He changed his address.
"A bad habit, once formed, is difficult to get rid of."
I've made the same mistakes as I made last time.
Tom hates his tiny bedroom.
Tom thought that Mary wouldn't need to do that.
Call me tonight.
I saw a dog.
"Hey, I want to help you."
Everybody gets what they deserve.
We want to talk to Tom.
Tom is sleeping in the next room.
The last train has already gone.
I think it's time for me to go to bed.
We discussed the problem.
All of the balls are yellow.
I'd like to ask a question.
Tom told me he was hot.
Please teach me French.
I don't believe in life after death.
"Do you have a moment, Tom?"
I'm the only one you can trust.
Tom wanted to have lunch with me today.
These shoes are obviously not large enough for Tom.
We're going to Boston for a week.
I could tell you who did that.
Tom is really smart.
He hardly works.
Do you want me to be frank?
Tom begged Mary to slow down.
Aren't you glad we're here instead of Boston?
How did you come by this money?
"I have a coat, but I have no hat."
"This is Tom, my colleague."
I understand Tom's position.
Tell Tom to be careful.
Some people like him and other people don't.
Who took it?
Tom hated us all.
Tom didn't even shake my hand.
Your flight leaves at 2:30.
Tom didn't give me time to think.
He is a hard man to approach.
Your phone is ringing.
I soon noticed his absence.
I'm sure I turned off the lights.
I'd like you to wear this.
"Hey, don't touch anything!"
I never thought I'd find a woman like you.
The architect designed that building.
I can't tell you how that happened.
I am still attached to this bicycle.
She needs you.
He was accused of theft.
Do you know how to play mahjong?
I completely agree with you.
Why are you so smart?
I didn't change a thing.
Do you think I should go alone?
What are you reading?
"If I had known her address, I could have visited her."
I will not tolerate this.
I even wrote a letter to Tom.
Was that another joke?
Do you have any stamps?
I'd like to talk with you in private.
Tom showed me how to make spaghetti.
Are you able to tell the difference between butter and margarine?
Please help me with this.
It'll cost $300 to fix it.
What were they doing?
Tom had no intention of going away.
Tom is in the bathroom washing his hands.
Love doesn't die.
I'm tired of everything.
Don't think about it anymore.
"Tom is his real name, isn't it?"
Horses run fast.
Sorry for being so late.
Did anybody sing with you?
Tom is eating ice cream.
Tom has rabbits.
Can you do that faster?
Did you let Tom drive your car?
A moat surrounds the castle.
That's utter nonsense.
Did you really give Tom a key to your apartment?
You write well.
Turn the knob counterclockwise.
I can't make out what he says.
We had three wonderful years together.
My grandfather says he's too old to swim.
You must go to the dentist.
Have you ever dyed your hair?
I didn't make the train.
I want to be an astronaut when I grow up.
She held out her hand.
I'm going to my uncle's this week.
We're not strangers.
That was so stupid.
It's rather impressive.
Everyone is drunk.
That boy is very smart.
I was the only one who didn't know.
We know where your family lives.
He bought eggs and milk from a farmer.
You didn't have to leave.
I knew you wouldn't let me down.
I almost got killed.
Just calm down a bit.
It's so dusty.
I knew we were going to win.
What would you call it?
Why didn't you wake me up?
I don't have time to help you with your homework.
She told me that his mother was a doctor.
When do the shops open?
I thought you had a date.
Don't underestimate yourself.
Tom didn't notice me.
I rode my bicycle a lot today.
I hope Tom does it.
Tom needs to come.
Tom isn't going to tolerate this.
Computer supplies are very expensive in Japan.
We went to Boston last month.
Tom will stop by today.
Get some sleep.
Your shoes are here.
I'd better go with you.
Tom started running.
Tom will never forgive you.
Money is welcome everywhere.
I don't think that anybody can help me now.
I'd like to be alone if you don't mind.
Everyone called me Tom.
I can't rule out that possibility.
Nobody has seen God.
Tom has very short hair.
This time I'm going with you.
"No, I didn't go."
She really needs your help.
You've been very kind to me.
Are you going to go anywhere this summer?
The temperature fell several degrees.
I haven't been getting enough sleep lately.
Please turn right.
My mother had to patch my pants.
Tom noticed that the mailbox was open.
The matter is coming up before the board of executives tomorrow.
Do you want me to stay here?
"If I were you, I would quit my job and leave Australia."
There is always something to do.
I didn't know Tom didn't understand French.
Tom has to learn French.
She doesn't have a driver's license.
Do you like studying?
When will her wedding be held?
I'm adventurous.
Tell me why she is crying.
Is this really necessary?
I know where to start.
Who did you think we were?
What are you doing at this hour?
I don't understand how the human brain works.
Tom was the winner.
The laboratory is busy now on a new scientific experiment.
Just listen to me.
Tom said he isn't going to be here tomorrow.
I know you're still in love with me.
"I've been invited there, too."
I hope we can help.
When is your birthday?
Tom never thought about the future.
You will get the better of him in the next election.
Who invited you?
I do that a lot.
I'll show that to you.
I don't know who built this house.
I've gained weight.
Your account is empty.
I have three dogs and three cats.
You can't sell it.
Have you lost weight?
What's Tom doing here?
There's still time to do that.
I'm sure you're wrong.
Don't swear in public.
Your dress is already out of fashion.
Sugary drinks have no nutritional value and contribute significantly to weight gain.
I think that Tom is asleep.
They aren't our enemies.
I don't think you should quit your job.
Tom will be all right.
I've had similar feelings.
Don't close the window.
Don't count on Tom's help.
I'm actually looking for Tom.
What Tom proposes will never work.
Tom picked up the letter and read it.
We've got news for you.
We did what we were told.
Do you know anything about art?
Her voice was shaking with anger.
Tom is devoted to you.
Tom went back.
Dogs can't tell colors apart.
Please stop.
Tom hasn't yet even kissed Mary.
I don't think Tom is in love with me.
I met him in Tokyo by chance.
Tom should've asked Mary to come to Boston.
Tom isn't responsible for what happened.
Do you want to risk that?
It's the right decision.
The girls went shopping.
Be watchful.
I won't be able to attend your wedding.
I don't feel like going out.
She let the secret out.
This one's for you.
I know how much money Tom has.
He will be here in half an hour.
Tom has gained a lot of weight recently.
She has been studying English since the age of ten.
Tom's French isn't bad.
What else do you need to do today?
Tom should apologize for what he said.
Who is your friend?
I can't find it. Are you sure it's here?
Who did you think we were?
I've translated three French novels into English.
Tom asked Mary to help him reinstall Windows.
Tom doesn't eat rice every day.
It was then I started to cry.
Tom said that he didn't mean to hurt you.
"I'm sorry, I forgot your name."
Don't come here again.
We bought a comfortable new armchair.
Didn't Tom go to Mary's house?
Didn't you know that Tom and I needed to do that?
Where's my driver?
Did you kill Tom?
We know how to find Tom.
"To my surprise, she could not answer the question."
Why are you drying your hair?
I really like this word.
He screams a lot.
Can you help solve this mystery?
Tom can't have been all that surprised.
I can't say that.
You said that it was urgent.
I've never had this kind a problem before.
I wouldn't let you win.
I went to the airport by taxi.
There's nothing more we can do for Tom.
She sells seashells by the seashore.
I'm not sure I want to do that.
Don't let Tom do that anymore.
Tom arrived too late.
"During the break, I went to look for Tom in the lobby."
I want you to drive.
I'm glad to be invited to dinner.
He went to London in 1970.
Tom told Mary to be quiet.
Do you want to sit in the shade?
I have a headache.
I bought a watch.
Somebody came.
I'm sure it was Tom that I saw in the park.
The problem is solved.
I'm lucky to have had good teachers.
I arrived first.
I tried not to look into her eyes.
How much time did it take to do that?
You're not hurt.
What is it you want to tell us?
Just tell me you're OK.
It looks like you're tired.
Tom listened to classical music.
You'd better wait for the next bus.
Just tell me what it is.
Tom just needs some more time.
I saw the way you looked at Tom.
Where can I find you?
Don't expect everyone to agree with you.
They only care about themselves.
I've been in Australia for three weeks.
Tom soon caught up with Mary.
Try this candy.
My jeans shrank.
They killed someone.
He scolded her for having left the door open.
There's something mysterious about her.
Let's go get drunk.
I don't know how tall Tom is.
Tom accepted Mary's apology.
I have a favor to ask of you.
Where's your black suit?
Don't give them to Tom.
Cars are expensive.
Mary works part-time as a nurse.
I can handle it.
I really need your help.
I hope that that doesn't happen.
My room has a large closet.
Tom lowered his voice and told Mary that he loved her.
Tom led the horse out of his stable.
Wait for the tea to brew.
I've got an appointment tomorrow with Tom.
I just didn't believe you.
I don't have any close friends.
I don't have a family yet.
Tom said that he wants to read all these books.
I wish I were by your side.
Maybe Tom will change his mind.
I don't think Tom knows how good a cook Mary is.
I didn't know you couldn't speak French.
How does it taste?
That's a tower.
Tom despises Mary.
I could not sleep because of the noise.
You're testing my patience.
Tom doesn't want to do anything at all.
Who'll sing with Tom?
There are a lot of beautiful places in Japan.
Isn't it always like that?
There's only one problem with our plan.
Are you close to your parents?
I didn't think that we should tell Tom about that.
Some people believe that black cats bring bad luck.
How did you hurt your leg?
My sister has many friends.
He's a bus driver.
Take a shower.
Forget Tom.
I hope that no one saw you coming in here.
I've visited Boston a few times.
Where did Tom buy all this?
What does your brother do?
Nobody forced you to do that.
I joined the navy.
You did that on purpose.
Mary fell in love with a very wealthy man.
This chimney is made of brick.
"Tom can drive, can't he?"
We'll never forget that.
Just stay calm.
Tom took a book down from the shelf.
Why are you waiting?
There is a post office at the end of the street.
Tom thinks you did that on purpose.
"I tried to eat it, but I couldn't."
Do you like my car?
Tom will see Mary today.
Did you forget to buy eggs?
We have to follow Tom.
Don't trust him. He's very two-faced.
We'll certainly try.
Now leave us.
Nobody told me you were here.
We both know this isn't right.
I don't think that I have enough time.
It gets quite hot in the summer.
I'm just looking around.
It's none of your business.
I was looking for the remote.
He worked hard to save up some money.
You've never been like this before.
How long will this storm last?
I didn't know you were sleepy.
Tom leaned over and kissed Mary's cheek.
Have you seen my pen?
I don't think that's allowed.
Who was he?
Tom is in heaven.
Tom did this.
Tom is often disrespectful towards his teachers.
The bus is coming.
I thought you looked sad.
Tom isn't afraid of dying.
Do you want to speak privately?
Don't cut in line.
I felt guilty about it.
Would you like to see it again?
When can you start?
I don't need anybody's permission.
Tom says that he feels much better now.
How many foreign languages do you know?
I don't want to go outside.
Who broke the vase?
Didn't you know that Tom moved to Boston?
The flowers are opening.
I wonder if I can do it again.
I cannot do without this book.
I know I can rely on you.
I trust you and Tom.
Nature endowed her with wit and beauty.
Make a sentence with each of these words.
I'm confident I can do that.
She looks like a boy.
I'm not as stupid as Tom is.
Why don't you want to swim today?
The situation is extremely critical.
This gift is from Tom.
Nobody is forcing you to do this.
I forgot to feed the dog.
I don't want to sign that.
Tom doesn't have as many friends as Mary.
Does Tom like school?
I really want to meet Tom.
I know why you did it.
Tom goes to bed early.
I don't think that Tom understood what was happening.
There is a television in this room.
Her health seemed to suffer.
Will you show me what you bought?
I lost my glasses.
I don't know very many Canadians.
He bored us with his long stories.
I'll never forgive myself for hitting Tom.
I'd like to see him.
I speak French every day.
I wasn't told where we were going.
How busy were you yesterday?
Are you saying that this is my fault?
Tom knew it could be too late.
Tom turned off the engine and shut off the headlights.
Tom has chickens.
I've never seen you like this before.
I found this in our mailbox.
I saw that movie three years ago.
Tom came into the room a few minutes after Mary.
No such person exists.
I just changed my password.
This castle was built in 1610.
Tom hoisted the flag.
Today is my treat.
Tom loves going to movies.
It's not fair.
I didn't believe you.
It's all new to me.
Tom may be a traitor.
Tom is a harpist.
I think it'll rain tonight.
Is this your first time in Australia?
Tom had an accident.
He pushed his nose against the window.
That's alright.
I feel kind of sorry for him.
He had no distinguishing features.
Do you need money?
Tom said that Mary wasn't planning to go anywhere.
What time does the next train leave for Tokyo?
I have a first-aid kit in my car.
I think I know what Tom is doing.
Tom went to his study and locked the door.
I know what Tom is talking about.
Let me give you my phone number.
Do you have enough money?
I hope you're right about this.
They can't fire you.
I'm still thinking about it.
Tom has been married three times.
How much milk should I buy?
I know that I don't deserve you.
When did you realize something was wrong?
I am proud to work with you.
Why do you think that?
I'd have preferred you do that.
Can you drive?
I threw up three times.
He wanted to make singing a career.
I wish he had attended the meeting.
We never eat lunch before noon.
Let's ski.
We need to hurry.
He was paralyzed with terror.
Tom goes to Boston three times a month.
Tom is a hunter.
Does that mean you agree?
You should call your mother more often.
Tom told me he wanted to quit.
I'm ready to order.
Tom has no choice but to stay.
Tom has lots of shoes.
You said you'd help us.
Tom finished his homework.
"It's the rule, not the exception."
What do you need to know?
I think Tom made a mistake.
You have no idea how much time I've spent on this project.
I'm very optimistic.
Tom and I used to spend a lot of time together.
You did that quickly.
It's an hour's walk to the station.
"I forgave Tom, but I'll never forgive you."
Do you really want us to do that?
Tom wants me to give him everything that I have.
Tell Tom that I'm coming.
Let's wait till Monday.
You don't know what I was going to do.
Nobody likes them.
Compare the facts.
Nobody asked Tom.
Tom is too busy to come.
I can only walk about three kilometers at a stretch.
One of my tires blew out coming down here.
Maybe you'll succeed.
A boy your age ought to behave well.
I can smell flowers.
I'll never leave you.
He has just become a principal.
Tom said he didn't want to study French.
Tom is raking it in.
Will you tell the truth now?
I take a taxi to the train station once or twice a week.
Tom asked Mary not to leave him alone.
I'm very glad to hear the news.
When did you go?
Where's my phone?
Napoleon was banished to Elba in 1814.
Why aren't you wearing your scarf?
I always catch a cold in the winter.
I'm trying to figure out what happened.
"If we don't hurry, we'll be late."
Did Tom do that out of spite?
Is it time to go?
I'm just trying to find Tom.
There are a lot to choose from.
You don't have to pay.
Have you told Tom who to give that to?
Why do you want to go back to Australia?
Tom will be an adult soon.
Tom and Mary became friends.
Do you believe in the power of love?
I thought you'd speak French better than Tom.
"Without the map, he would have gotten lost."
He opened the cages.
Is it yours?
I had a pretty happy childhood.
She has a brother in Tokyo.
I plan to tell Tom about you.
"Tom is retired, isn't he?"
Have you ever met a famous person?
What do you have to read?
I'm pretty sure Tom won't do that.
Tom left before I could ask any questions.
His story was published in a magazine.
Do you like bowling?
I'm used to the noise.
I don't have to go.
We have to get as much information as possible.
I quit smoking three years ago.
It's probably cold in Boston now.
I tried to convince Tom to go to Boston with Mary.
Tom is so happy.
Do you know Tom's father?
That's the chair that I really like.
She danced with a grace that surprised us all.
The facts speak for themselves.
To some extent I agree with you.
Do you go to school by bus?
What do you think Tom should do?
Tom washed his hands and face.
Do you watch television?
Tom is no longer welcome here.
Tom told Mary a very strange story.
The doctor examined my throat.
Is Tom going to help Mary do that?
I'm glad to see you again.
That's just absurd.
I know about Tom and Mary.
What would you like to buy your mother for her birthday?
I know it by heart.
Tom didn't want to die.
I don't know how much money Tom and Mary spend.
I forgot my bag.
Go put on something more conservative.
I'd like to come to see the doctor as soon as possible.
Do you want to do that again?
I feel it now.
I owe you nothing.
I plan to do that at 2:30.
I don't know why they hate each other so much.
It will cool down tonight.
The waiter came over to take away Tom's empty plate.
I'm overworked.
I know that Tom is deaf.
I'll never forgive you for what you did.
"If you want to talk, talk."
Tom is going to drive you to the airport.
I won't leave this house voluntarily.
I lost my way in New York.
I just need to rest a little.
Tom has good chance of winning.
You fixed it.
I got first place.
This book is full of mistakes.
Tom almost died after eating the mushrooms that Mary had gathered.
We have a little time left.
Stay in this room.
I sent you the money you asked for.
Tom installed an alarm system in his house.
Tom gave it back to Mary.
I'm taking Tom to the park.
This is a private party.
Didn't you know that Tom is a French teacher?
Tom gave Mary some money.
They don't trust each other.
"No matter how carefully you choose your words, they'll always end up being twisted by others."
"Oh, have a heart."
Mind your manners.
Tom is probably not rich.
Let the kids have fun.
I'd like to do that now.
I don't think that it's Tom's fault.
I rarely eat meat.
We haven't increased our prices.
Tom will go in your place.
Please ask only one question at a time.
You can't be thirty years old.
I want you out of my life.
Do you like writing?
It happened so quickly.
Let's stay in touch.
Tom lived here for thirty years.
Tom just did Mary a big favor.
Please promise me that you won't do that.
There was a moon that night.
I'm very sorry I came home so late.
Leave it there.
Don't bother me.
Please don't tell anyone else.
I thought you hated Australia.
Your family needs you.
Tom asked me if I agreed with Mary.
I closed the doors.
We've won!
Do you think Mary wears smart clothes?
Somebody has broken into my house.
I don't know what to do first.
Ask your question.
The car drove away.
There have been some changes.
Tom played the drums.
"May I come in? ""Yes, certainly."""
Sometimes it's necessary to tell the truth.
Both Tom and Mary don't like John.
Tom says he really likes it here.
The child is always begging for something.
Both Tom and Mary know that's unlikely to happen.
We must stay perfectly calm.
They love us.
I don't think it's as important as Tom thinks it is.
You already know too much.
Please don't use Facebook during business hours.
"May I go with you? ""Of course."""
Tom is fed up with Mary.
What's the difference between a star and a planet?
Tom didn't sign the contract.
I'm going on a run.
He is a very careful driver.
I warned you.
"Tom's car needed a wash, so he left it out in the rain."
Tom doesn't like you.
Please clear out this closet.
I don't want to hurt anyone.
I'm conservative.
Did you watch the game?
I saw her for the last time.
Try to stay objective.
Call the FBI.
Don't believe that.
Tom is too young to do that.
"If you would like to have a sample, please let us know."
I wasn't even sure you knew it.
I usually get up at eight o'clock.
Tom chased Mary.
May I turn down the TV?
Tom told me you'd win.
I'll come and see you later.
Is there anything wrong?
Tom has already gone to work.
Tom became a drug addict.
I don't have a picture of you.
I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
Tom was badly beaten.
We're meditating.
I'm trying to calm Tom down.
Tom does anything I tell him to.
I told Tom why I decided to study French.
Tom said that Mary was angry.
Can you see the nest in the tree?
I don't think that Tom would notice that.
Why didn't you come yesterday?
Tom wants to visit Boston.
It's a good thing you have your umbrella with you.
Tom wanted Mary to speak.
Thanks for adding me as a friend.
Have you ever written a computer program?
Start writing.
I can't face the truth.
Tom is a fat man.
Tom stopped arguing.
The doctor advised Tom to have at least three alcohol-free days per week.
Mary doesn't understand why Tom chose a cat as his online avatar.
I made you coffee.
Where's the pharmacy?
I don't have time.
Tom couldn't understand why Mary frowned at him.
You're both pretty.
Do you have a complete set of Tom Jackson's works?
I think you already have enough money to buy what you need.
Perhaps Tom was wrong.
Please bring it back tomorrow.
He's done his homework.
Tom probably should've asked Mary to help him.
Watch what you're doing.
"If my brother hadn't saved me, I would've drowned."
I've been paid already.
There won't be any surprises.
Wow! It's been a long time.
Tom asked me to come inside.
I thought you were married.
I leaned forward.
Please go with Tom.
Friendship bound them together.
Please wake me up at six tomorrow.
Which one is my cup?
They are lazy. I can't understand such people.
Please ask him to call me.
Tell me where the wine is.
"All of a sudden, he proposed to me."
Tell Tom that you don't need it.
It's hard to ignore Tom.
I'm not going to do to you what you want me to do.
One's new. The other's old.
I thought that Tom was married.
Do you have any questions for us?
I paid for Tom.
I haven't eaten anything for days.
I paid for you and Tom.
You must tell me everything.
I'm too thin.
Call me back when you find it.
Tom wanted to be a teacher.
Tom opened a restaurant.
Get me a glass of milk.
This is gibberish.
Your mother loves me.
Do you want to sell them?
Don't throw stones.
They stayed at home because it was very cold.
Please let me stay.
I don't think anybody saw us do that.
A lot of people need our help.
All their efforts were in vain.
Don't tell them.
That sword is fit for a prince.
We can still break even.
I don't play any instrument.
Tom wasn't the only eyewitness.
"Tom is on this plane, isn't he?"
I have lost my watch.
I'm sorry I can't help you now. I'm busy.
Are you texting Tom?
It's not anything serious.
"You aren't going to tell my parents, are you?"
She grabbed him by the hand and pulled him onto the boat.
That's your seat.
Have you lied to me?
I'm the only one who can do that.
It wasn't an easy job.
I forgot to buy ketchup.
Tom left his laptop at home.
Steam trains were replaced by electric trains.
Tom and Mary woke up early to see the first sunrise of the year.
Have pity on me.
"Yes, of course, you're correct."
Do you actually believe that?
Ask me again in October.
I'm getting better.
We're just students.
I was unconscious.
Tom doesn't know who did that.
He likes drinking coffee without sugar.
I wonder if Tom cried.
Tom put his passport in his pocket.
You can't sit here if you're not going to play poker with us.
I don't know who he is.
How long have you been doing that?
I didn't know that you were so tired.
Tom isn't a carpenter.
I've learned my lesson.
I'd like a map of the city.
No one knows where Tom is.
Does Tom like it there?
That's enough for today. I'm tired.
That was the scary part.
Do you know who invented gunpowder?
I know Tom did that alone.
Tom admitted he was afraid.
I saw an airplane.
I'm lucky nobody saw me do that.
Tom plugged in the radio and turned it on.
That remains a big problem.
I do want to see you.
What makes you think Tom enjoys doing that?
Tom will come for sure.
Tom and I didn't go to that movie together.
I've been here since October.
You need to go talk to Tom.
Health is worth more than gold.
Tom wants a dog.
I think your answer is correct.
I'm going to go take a shower.
Tom told me about you.
We could do this some other time.
They aren't my parents.
I think the game will be exciting.
Come and see me.
I've done what you've asked.
We were at school together.
Tom doesn't like working the graveyard shift.
"I didn't know you could cook this well, Tom."
Tom doesn't know anything about us.
Why does this surprise you?
There are discrepancies.
I knew that he was reading.
You're hurting him.
Tom said he wanted to kill Mary.
She was about to go out.
The train stopped suddenly and I spilled my coffee.
I want to know who told Tom that.
Tom will always be here for you.
I handed him a map.
The noise kept me awake all night.
Don't expect a coherent answer.
You don't have to explain anything.
Everybody but you laughed.
You have a bright future.
Please come inside.
We know what this means to Tom.
The Smiths are our neighbors.
I'll tell you an interesting story.
Tom didn't have to hurry.
Are you busy these days?
They're staring at you.
Don't play here.
I need to put the children to bed.
You're interesting.
I'll be ready on Monday.
I couldn't say anything.
I would never forgive myself if anything happened to you.
It seems that Tom is unable to solve the problem.
We ought to leave now.
"If it doesn't stop raining, I won't go."
Choose carefully.
I think that anyone can do that.
Why don't you just forget it?
I still don't speak French very well.
It wasn't until I got home that I missed my umbrella.
The cost of living in America was rising.
I'd prefer meat to fish.
Tom is accustomed to hard work.
Tom used to be engaged to Mary.
I am engaged in a new business.
I have to choose between these two.
Tom did that yesterday.
I bought a gift for Tom.
Tom doesn't have any problems.
Tom hasn't eaten anything for three days.
We must learn to work together.
He's just like his grandfather.
Tom is in the van.
He's still sponging off his father.
I've been looking all over for you.
You weren't wrong.
You've won.
I don't like Easter eggs.
Do you have safety deposit boxes?
There's no need to exaggerate.
There is an urgent need for blood donors.
You are the only one who can help me.
The truck nearly ran me over.
Did you hear about what's happened to Tom?
Tom told me that he'd come again.
I'm sure they're talking about us.
Tom knew that I was cold.
Why are you whispering?
I say what I think.
It's sprinkling outside.
Tom was injured in the accident.
I knew this wouldn't work.
I need to talk to you in person.
Change your clothes.
I forgot my email address.
Why does Tom want me to leave?
I agree with everything you've said.
Your clothes are out of fashion.
"Tom died on October 20, 2013 in Boston."
I've been acting like an idiot.
I'll see to all the arrangements.
Is it true that you were absent yesterday?
I am glad that you have helped me.
He finally realized that Mary had made a fool of him.
The soldier took shelter in the foxhole.
Don't you think you could do better?
My legs hurt.
You must stay here.
Where do you work now?
I'd like you to translate this into French.
Are you a criminal?
Tom got angry because of what Mary said.
It'll be fall soon.
All we can do is wait.
He did a pretty good job.
I think Tom and Mary are right.
This is Tom's umbrella.
Tom acknowledges that he was defeated.
Look at the picture at the top of the page.
Nobody helped us.
I know Tom knows.
This soil is moist.
Is your father rich?
Luckily nobody was hurt in the accident.
I want to hear about it.
Aren't you going to help?
All legitimate claims will be settled.
That's what I thought.
We'll miss you.
Tom said he was unhurt.
Who do you think will win the election?
Tell me how it works.
We had hoped you could do it for us.
I suggest that you read this document first.
Tom is a doctor now.
I wonder if Tom knows how to play the flute.
I don't think that Tom knows when Mary will be here.
Tom wants to say something to you.
I hope no one saw you coming in here.
It isn't locked.
Are you waiting for someone?
I'll check again.
Twelve is an even number.
Tom is a thirty-year-old carpenter.
You shouldn't have sold your old car.
Tom came here from Boston.
I'll show it to you.
Wood burns easily.
We may as well wait.
I have a lot of friends now.
Which do you think is best?
Tom prefers to park behind the house.
I didn't want any of my friends to know that I was in prison.
I think you know them both.
It's terribly urgent.
Is anyone hurt?
On what grounds were you fired?
Who knows what happened?
This watch is ten minutes fast.
I'm going to quit smoking.
What's in this drink?
They each received a present.
Please stop that.
Will you go with Tom?
Why do you want me to leave?
Do you know where?
Tom's new book is about Mary.
Tom fell to the floor.
I'd give you more if I could.
So where were you?
Tom helped Mary get in the car.
Dating your coworkers is a bad idea.
We ought to win.
I can't talk about it now.
How long have you been in Boston?
Tom confessed to killing Mary.
Love blinded him to her faults.
I think I can reach the branch if you'll give me a boost.
You need to believe in something.
The bus just left.
You must remain calm.
You should've never interfered.
It was load off my mind.
This oak tree is very old.
The wedding will take place next spring.
Let's open all the windows.
"His name is Tom, not John."
Do you know what it is?
Tom tried on the shirt.
Tom and Mary don't know each other very well.
I will postpone my trip to Scotland until it is warmer.
Should we go?
Tom didn't say when he was going to leave.
When do you want me to call you?
Tom said he was sick.
Did Tom stay?
I don't have anything else to do.
The traffic light turned green.
We're on your side.
I'll find my car on my own.
Prices have gone down.
My father is in.
What happened to you last night?
Who are you and what do you want?
"In 2013, Tom was living in Boston."
I hope you're correct.
Tom has been awake since 2:30.
Tom is extremely forgetful.
Do you enjoy studying?
This custom dates back to the 12th century.
How do you know all of this?
It was dark and cold in the room.
Where do you have pain?
I can walk to school in 10 minutes.
I helped Tom wash the dishes.
How much are eggs?
Tom handed Mary the menu.
He behaved as if he were crazy.
You lost your chance.
He would not give the order.
Kids catch colds easily.
I came to talk to Tom.
I don't think Tom is back.
You never know for sure.
I'd like to give you a piece of advice.
It's been more than a month.
I'm not surprised that happened.
Tom's eyes are wide open.
Do you happen to know where Tom went?
How could you say yes without consulting me?
Tom didn't take a bath for a week.
Here are the rules.
Don't leave me alone.
I gave Tom a blanket.
A good deal remains to be done.
Has Tom told Mary that he doesn't really know how to speak French?
Let's play chess.
I'm not sure you're ready.
Please mail this letter on your way to work.
I don't know the person you're talking about.
The French like to make fun of Belgians.
Tom was generous.
Don't talk to anyone.
That's plastic.
I used to live close to Tom.
She asked him some questions.
I suppose I shouldn't have said that.
The lessons are getting more and more difficult.
Meet me at my office.
I can't stand babies crying.
I was thinking about asking her out.
Tom may have been poisoned.
Tom says I talk too much.
You forgot to tell me to buy bread.
Can you describe how Tom died?
I would rather stay at home than go out on such a cold day.
Tom is dieting.
You've got to help us.
Tom wondered what Mary would say if she knew he had spent the past week in Boston with Alice.
I invited Tom to go to a movie with me.
Is Tom going to die?
Yours is over there.
I will choose one of them.
Did you help Tom wash windows?
I don't get it either.
It is no use complaining about the weather.
I have to warn them.
She accidentally tore the page.
Come downstairs.
This was built some 500 years ago.
His suit was gray and his tie was yellow.
Tom is really rich.
You have no other choice.
I'm a stranger here myself.
Do you carry weapons?
Who have I offended now?
Living abroad is the best way to learn a foreign language.
Seriously?
How many people got injured?
I need a place to sit.
Tom had a new scar on his forehead since the last time Mary had seen him.
Don't think I didn't try.
Somebody laughed.
Tom wants to blame us.
I can't tell you when Tom will get here.
You'll need to wear a tie.
I don't think that I need to go.
I saw the car explode.
Wait. I can't walk that fast.
I cannot get rid of my cough.
The earth moves around the sun.
"Turn toward me, please."
Did you understand Tom?
Why wasn't I notified?
She isn't as stupid as she looks.
Tom wanted Mary to help.
I know that I don't deserve it.
Does that even work?
I'm not your servant.
All you need to do is listen carefully.
"My father doesn't drink. ""Neither does my father."""
Which floor is it on?
You're in my hands.
Tom turns thirteen the day after tomorrow.
Tom ate the apple.
It is close to seven o'clock.
You have your T-shirt on backwards.
I would like you to trust me.
Don't interfere in my affairs.
Tom said he needed to do that today.
Please don't do this.
I hope he comes tomorrow.
Do you like to cook?
I admit nothing.
How long will this go on?
This stone was too heavy for me to lift.
You don't know that for sure.
Tom is still in shock.
Why didn't you ask for my help?
That's one of them.
Don't let them in.
I'm the one who makes the decisions.
Tom wanted to prove to his friends he could do it.
Do you think I'm too tall?
You have something on your face.
I will help you all I can.
How much did you win?
The blueberries are defrosting on the table.
Tom rides his bicycle to work.
That man stole my purse.
The sun went down behind the mountains.
The blonde's name is Mary.
I manage a hotel.
Tom seems to want to help Mary.
How long have you been sitting here?
Tom asked us to go with Mary.
Have you ever heard Tom sing?
I came to Toronto at the beginning of June.
I made you cookies.
This dress will look better on you.
Who is this guy?
Is Tom ill?
I thought Tom was your boyfriend.
Is he still here?
You're a tall boy.
Tom is afraid to do that.
Tom doesn't really understand.
That was a lie.
Are you sure that's necessary?
Tom told Mary things she already knew.
Tom asked us to be silent.
There were no tickets available for Friday's performance.
Don't fail to write to me.
I got up very early today.
Don't worry. We can remedy the mistake we've made.
Are you asking me to resign?
You shouldn't have let this happen.
Tom is wearing a blue bandana on his head.
I didn't know Tom had a horse.
Things don't just happen.
Try to explain.
You have a beautiful family.
I've never fallen in love.
What does Tom do now?
He went to bed.
"It's possible, isn't it?"
"Stay with me, Tom."
You don't have to be so sarcastic.
Tom will pay for what he did.
I told Tom I'd made a mistake.
Tom did that without Mary's help.
Go to the barbershop.
Put it down.
I know that you won't like this movie.
Have some ham.
Tom is old enough to be Mary's father.
Don't flatter yourself.
We're survivors.
Thank you for closing the door.
Tom has been sick for three weeks.
Tom is having a lot of fun.
We can't close the deal until my partner arrives.
Tom pointed at the open window.
You don't know how much money I owe.
"I was born in the north, but now I live in Florida."
Tom doesn't always obey the rules.
Tom never told me he loved me.
Tom has already told me what you plan to do.
He does nothing but complain all day long.
Don't tell my wife that.
I bet Tom knows how to swim.
You're very attractive.
I have twins.
That doesn't change a thing.
You've got to get rid of it.
I know you're afraid.
Does Tom know how much you paid for that?
Our cat is missing.
What he said yesterday is not consistent with what he had said last week.
You've got to go home.
Tom will never consent.
Tom took care of them.
I went for a walk to get some air.
I wish I had a motorcycle.
Tom lives about twenty minutes away from Mary.
That's why Tom won.
Put the gun away.
You're a little weird.
Do you want to know?
He kept it secret.
Tom seemed to be staring at something in the corner of the room.
He paid his loan back to the bank.
I came to see you.
Have my kids been annoying you?
I'm not sure.
We've barely begun.
I've never trusted you and I never will.
Why don't you just ask your parents for money?
Everyone was surprised when I went into the room.
The airplane flies at a speed of five hundred kilometers per hour.
Please wait here until I get back.
Tom knows what that is.
I'll try to find out where Tom lives.
Can I have some tea?
We've already decided to do that.
The play is at eight o'clock.
We have to be at work by nine.
Tom looks happy today.
I thought it looked suspicious.
It's a sad story.
I'll take a shortcut across the garden.
You're not going to believe me.
I just want it to stop.
Would you like to join our team?
Are you sure Tom will let us do that?
I had to see you again.
Why are you pretending you don't know me?
I hope that Tom will never do that again.
I'll tell you about it sometime.
Tom handed me the binoculars.
I'll find another one.
Tom can do that for you.
We've got a problem here.
His head ached.
Chairs and tables were damaged.
I didn't do my homework.
I'm pretty sure Tom doesn't believe us.
Tom didn't eat the apple you gave him.
Tom wasn't perfect.
Are you still in Boston?
Don't let anyone press this button.
Tom has a really nice voice.
I was born on the 22 of November 1948.
We are trying a completely new method.
"Without me, you won't be able to do it."
Get Tom.
I'm as tall as you.
Why don't we find out?
I'd better take you to the hospital.
We can't leave Tom alone.
They're old friends.
This is technically impossible.
Didn't you know Tom used to study French?
Do you want to visit Australia?
Now isn't a very good time.
"I don't understand Dutch, because it's difficult."
I'll tell my wife.
I would leave if I were you.
I told Tom to stay at home.
It got colder day by day.
That's what I live for.
Tom chuckled when he heard Mary's joke.
We're sorry. The number you have dialed is currently unavailable.
Poets have compared life to a voyage.
Tom talked too much and let the secret slip.
Tom married Mary.
Tom wants me to help Mary.
Tom doesn't like it when people laugh at him.
I said I didn't remember.
It's his.
Keep the door locked.
Birds build nests.
"Unless you stop fighting, I'll call the police."
Tom finally realized there was something wrong.
Did you buy candles?
Civilization is the limitless multiplication of unnecessary necessities.
She is a very nice person.
I don't like repeating myself.
"You don't know Tom's brother, do you?"
I need another one.
Tom isn't likely to stay home alone.
Do you believe in soulmates?
You can't put toothpaste back in the tube.
I arrived at the village before dark.
"Don't be afraid, I'm here."
Tom wants a divorce.
We went back to the living room.
I've got something.
Tom fooled them.
Give me another one.
I can't add anything else.
What are you afraid of?
Tom and Mary intend to divorce each other.
Tom said that he didn't care what I do.
I used to work in the same restaurant as Tom.
Tom says he loves us both.
Put your pants on.
I felt like I would die.
I think there's been a misunderstanding.
Who else is going with us?
I am afraid your plan will not work.
My father grows rice.
Send Tom a note.
I suspect that Tom and Mary aren't very hungry.
Tom isn't the right man for this job.
Tom crashed his car a week after he bought it.
Tom told me that he was afraid.
I can't wait all day.
I repeated what he said word for word.
I hear that Tom is now a teacher.
Does Tom have a tattoo?
When did you start writing songs?
Do you want me to pick up Tom after school?
Tom bought his mother flowers for Mother's Day.
Did you tell the truth?
My regular waitress wouldn't have anything to do with me.
Tom stabbed Mary repeatedly with his knife.
I need to talk with you.
Let's ignore that.
How long after that did Tom die?
Tom picked up the dice and threw them.
Tom didn't finish his homework.
What do you know about Tom?
Are there any bananas?
I know I'm adopted.
You are rich.
It's not a fair fight.
I'm tired of playing games.
Tom has moved back to Boston.
Can I get back to work?
We're going to be in Boston all week.
You're experienced.
Tom needs open heart surgery.
You'll understand when you grow up.
Tom shouldn't be so greedy.
I'm sure Tom would be very interested in what you have to say.
I hope that doesn't happen.
I just wanted to be with Tom.
Do you want me to help you with the cooking?
Nothing would give me greater pleasure.
Let me think about it.
She refused my offer to help her.
Tom is meeting Mary in three hours.
Tom doesn't tell me anything.
Could you ask Tom to stop by after work?
When were you fired?
How long have you known about this?
I feel bad about what happened.
I don't like what's going on.
We often play tennis together.
Tom has cancer.
Tom doesn't like to talk about that.
He is well read in English literature.
I belong to the baseball team.
An Englishman would not use such a word.
Give me thirty dollars now and I'll pay you back Monday.
I got fined.
I told the truth.
Tom seems attracted to Mary.
What was Tom saying?
Did you read all of it?
I think you're just wasting your time.
How did the meeting go?
You don't know all the facts.
Tom disagreed with the decision.
Do you want me to go?
Tom said that you needed this.
Let me pay.
I don't want you putting yourself at risk.
I've already told you that.
We need to prepare for the worst.
Why are you afraid of Tom?
"If I had money, I'd buy a computer."
My brother is working at a gas station.
Tom was in the passenger seat.
"If you give me Tom's phone number, I'll call him."
I never told anyone about what happened.
Tom is a new student.
Everybody knows it now.
Tom and Mary will do that.
Are you still friends with them?
I love roast chicken.
I don't know what happened to Tom.
Tom and Mary couldn't agree on which one to buy.
Did you read Tom's letter?
Tom wouldn't let Mary quit.
Germany borders on France.
That's pathetic.
Don't give up hope yet.
Unlock it.
Thanks for sharing your thoughts.
Tom isn't my father.
It's Tom's turn to help wash the dishes.
I wonder who's going to help us.
My dream is to study abroad.
I can't express my feelings.
That's ugly.
Strange things happened that night.
A monument was erected in memory of the deceased.
Tom says Mary will cry.
Drop me a line.
Tom told Mary he wanted to move to Boston.
There's no evidence.
Why wasn't Tom invited?
I still have three months till I get out of prison.
Tom said that he didn't want me to win.
She did it on purpose.
A lot has changed since then.
Are you here on business?
We'll kill you.
We arrived home late.
Most of these are Tom's.
I got the job.
That's another concern of mine.
Are you saying that this is my fault?
Why don't you let Tom win?
I'm interested in that house you've got for rent on Park Street.
Show this gentleman the way.
You have to stop them.
I caught her by the hand.
We were trying to protect Tom.
Tom feels that his team will win the game.
I thought you'd gone to Boston.
Tom rushed out onto the road without looking both ways.
I ate at a restaurant.
I didn't show it to Tom.
It isn't difficult to do that.
"Hi, guys."
Tom has insomnia.
I've been waiting for you.
Do you have mobile phones?
I didn't wait for Tom.
Tom is acting a little strange.
Tom is faithful to Mary.
Who wants to learn French?
It's a miracle I'm still alive.
"Tom may be old, but he's in good shape."
Whose side are you on?
How are they doing that exactly?
Tom opened his desk drawer.
Why do you use this font?
They were talking about me.
Today was definitely shorts and T-shirt weather.
Tom became depressed after Mary left him.
Tom hates himself.
Sit here.
I didn't call Tom last night.
You've both been very impressive today. I'm proud of you.
All you can do is to wait.
How is Tom doing?
I don't want to let you go.
Have you eaten lunch?
What Tom is saying isn't true.
I forgot his name.
Do you like peanut butter?
I can't say anything at this time.
I don't know why that's funny.
I'll show you where I work.
The thermometer says it's thirty degrees in here.
He's helping me.
Tom has fully recovered.
Where do you plan to go fishing?
Tom's searching for his biological father.
Didn't you know Tom lived on Park Street?
Are you awake?
What sort of yogurt do you like best?
"Tom thinks he's a genius, but I don't agree with him."
I need to leave for a while.
Tom didn't tell Mary that he was leaving.
I have the feeling there's something you haven't told me yet.
We'll send the textbooks in three different lots.
Go wash your hands.
Mr. Jackson teaches us French.
Tom is supposed to be asleep.
Do you know anybody in Australia?
Tom is probably still busy.
His car was seriously damaged.
The doctor performed the operation.
Why do you think Tom was absent today?
Did you know that that's from Boston?
"Tom asked Mary to marry him, but she refused."
That child wants someone to play with.
Tom complained that Mary never helped him.
Nobody could remember the sequence of events.
Tom brushed the snow off his clothes.
He came home at six.
They walked down the street singing a song.
Do you have any ID?
Don't talk down to me.
Didn't you know that Tom lived in Boston for three years?
You didn't understand.
What did Tom do to Mary?
What did you have for lunch?
Tom felt a bit tired.
Where did you have your picture taken?
Are you still planning on staying?
Tom is a very creative person.
Tom didn't know how to express his feelings.
Tom doesn't speak French at work.
We'll catch Tom.
Tom isn't very religious.
It's a pipe dream.
I didn't even recognize Tom.
He will run for mayor.
I want you to take it.
I know a lot.
Tom was Mary's first husband.
They all thought Tom was crazy.
It was raining this morning.
I did it wrong.
It isn't raining much this year.
Is it OK if I start?
When did you learn to drive?
Do you think Tom killed himself?
I put it here somewhere.
I'll write to you.
I don't think that Tom can help you.
His speech charmed the audience.
I started going to the gym.
We finally published the book.
Tom told me he was unlucky.
It isn't going to rain this evening.
How much weight have you gained?
Are you going to be OK?
"She looks young, but she's actually over forty."
Tom wanted to learn how to read.
Please keep this door locked.
Tom has lost a lot of weight.
Have you got a match?
I don't want to be told what to do.
Don't ask any more questions.
Stop teasing your brother!
I only have one so far.
My brother-in-law is a cop.
Tell me what you know about it.
You should be in bed.
I'm going to Boston to visit a friend.
"To me, she's irreplaceable."
It was a dark night.
Tom can't afford to buy that.
Aren't these your books?
It is really wonderful.
"Tom always wears a hat, even inside."
Neither Tom nor Mary thanked John.
It looks good on you.
"Unfortunately, that hasn't happened."
Are you still talking about me?
Something's wrong with Tom's car.
Who wrote the book?
I'm your servant.
Nobody is insulting you.
Your car is being towed.
That's not up to you.
I lost my notebook today.
Why don't we sit?
I won't be able to help you today.
Are you happy here?
I hope Tom is waiting for us.
This is our only chance.
My father had once been in Greece.
"I'm very pleased to meet you, too."
I have a pretty good idea.
She was formerly a bank clerk.
There was never this much snow before.
Tom showered and shaved.
I don't think Tom knows how to ride a unicycle.
Would you like them to help you?
I don't care at all.
Do you have a shoehorn?
I'm staying at a hotel not far from here.
Nobody had ever asked Mary out before.
Someone coughed.
We couldn't open the door because it was locked from the inside.
Maybe you shouldn't go with Tom.
That was not my question.
That's just what I need.
Tom speaks without an accent.
Tom doesn't need to worry.
We need to talk.
I hope you feel better tomorrow.
Tom and Mary are the main suspects.
That was mine.
Tom started talking to Mary.
Tom insulted Mary.
Did you know that that was going to happen?
Help! I've been locked in!
There was a lot to talk about.
The meeting has been postponed.
I never sing.
I thought I told you to keep the door closed.
I think I've fallen out of love with Mary.
One of the men had a large red scar across his forehead.
Where can I meet you?
You deserved that.
Leave the bottle.
I hope that it doesn't snow tomorrow.
"At the beginning, I couldn't understand it."
This dress is too big for me.
A lot of people swim here in the summer.
Can you speak a little slower?
I'm living in Boston now.
None of us saw it.
Mary changes her nail color almost every day.
Go back.
We might not have enough time to eat lunch.
He has no choice.
What do you have planned for tomorrow?
"I'm sorry, I forgot your name."
"If we walk, we'll be very late."
I can barely see it.
Who needs it?
I'm headed downtown.
I read your book.
France is in western Europe.
You don't need this.
I didn't want to tell you this.
I wasn't expecting Tom to be here.
I didn't protest.
Tom called Mary and told her that he'd be late.
Tom said he couldn't find what he was looking for.
Tom said he would come to the wedding.
I was too ambitious.
She is in a bad mood.
I understood immediately what Tom meant.
Nobody is paying attention to Tom.
Tom and Mary are no longer in Boston.
I should've introduced myself.
You can draw your own conclusions.
Where did Tom buy this guitar?
There's a fine line between assertiveness and aggression.
Didn't you know Tom was interested in modern art?
Do you know who Tom is?
Is it hard to speak French?
He has a strong body.
Tom told me about it himself.
Milk makes us strong.
She fainted when she saw blood.
Do you know my son?
I would like to hear your opinion.
Someone scratched my car.
I knew we would come back.
Your T-shirt's on backwards.
I wasn't even here.
I don't think Tom is listening to me.
Tom said that isn't the only reason.
We caught the thief.
Ask Tom why he needs the rope.
We all know it won't work.
Tom just ate lunch.
I've already read it.
Tom and I often swim together.
Who can blame you?
Be calm.
She cabled us that she was coming.
What was your mother doing when you came home?
That's what I want to talk to you about.
I thought that you were joking.
I really don't like Apple products.
Can you feel the difference?
Tom said he'd be leaving soon.
"When I was reading a book, the telephone rang."
I didn't know you were coming here either.
When was the last time you changed your password?
I'm sorry if I snapped at you.
"Of course, I feel guilty."
I burned the cake.
You seem a little tense.
Please don't come in.
Tom's very annoying.
Is this my fault or your fault?
I remember one fellow in particular.
Why were you late this morning?
I work at a hotel in Boston.
Please take off your shirt.
I said I was sad.
Do you have your passport?
We'll pray for you.
Tom has ordered one.
Tom and Mary are still at home.
It is no use crying over spilt milk.
You're young and energetic.
Let's switch places.
I'm glad that you weren't hurt.
Mary is on maternity leave.
I never want to talk about this again.
I think that's a good idea.
I wouldn't tell Tom about that if I were you.
Tom has three months left until he graduates.
Tom said that he wouldn't help me.
It seems Tom is disappointed.
Tom was surprised that anybody else was there.
I'm not alone.
Why not come and have supper with us tonight?
How long does it take from here to your house on foot?
My mother can't read without glasses.
He solved the difficult problem.
Do you have a table near the window?
I was absent from school because I had a cold.
What do you want to hear from me?
The water in this brook is cool and clear.
Would you donate a kidney?
Where did Tom get this car?
Are you bachelors?
You'll find the way all right once you get to the station.
This is my business address.
You never say thank you.
I swear I'm telling the truth.
Tom came in thirty minutes too early.
Humans can't live without air.
We have lots of snow in the winter.
What's not clear?
It happened one year ago.
You're just cowards.
Do you have this in another color?
Tom carefully removed the bandage.
Tom had a rough day.
Tom bit his tongue while he was talking.
Tom tried to control his anger.
I thought you'd found someone else.
Tell Tom he should stay out of sight.
Tom had only one leg.
Who'll pay for this?
The TV is broken.
Tom has already done that.
I'm busy right now.
Let Tom go.
Tom is on his way here.
I know Tom is hungry.
It happened in the dead of night.
You have been warned.
Tom is supposed to wait for you.
How much longer will Tom be in prison?
Tom called my bluff.
Tom tried to persuade Mary not to do that.
She tried not to shed a tear.
He forced me to go.
Hold the rope.
I've never said this before to anyone.
Did you give Tom something to eat?
I couldn't help but overhear your conversation with Tom.
Tom set me up.
Does milk spoil quickly?
I don't think that it's possible to do that.
No one speaks this language anymore.
How long ago did the bus leave?
I feel so pretty.
I happen to agree with Tom.
I knocked again.
When did you go to Boston?
How many of these pills did you take?
Tom continued doing that.
"I think if I talked more often with a native speaker, my English skills would improve quickly."
"I failed to catch the last bus, and came home by taxi."
Come with me.
Can't you just leave me alone?
Who would you vote for?
I hope you like Tom.
Tom has a butler.
Tom has a little money.
Where did you park?
Let Tom stay there.
When will you return home?
She has some beautiful antique furniture.
Will he get well?
I'm sure Tom didn't even notice you were late.
We need to decide what to do.
Tom's answer was quick and to the point.
We saw another ship far away.
"Bring me another fork, please."
Tom has more important things to worry about.
Tom got off with a fine.
I'll go buy some bread.
He has come a long way.
Tom called me today.
Why didn't you mention this before?
Tom needs an operation.
I can see you don't believe me.
You have made the very same mistake again.
I can see a man and a woman.
I miss her so much.
Tom had a lot of problems at the school.
Do you really think you can learn to speak French fluently in three months?
Aren't you supposed to be at school today?
He extinguished the fire.
I didn't know who to give the envelope to.
I don't think that Tom understands what you're saying.
Who could be calling me at this hour?
Tom was late for work.
Do you have room for another person in your car?
I don't want to disturb you.
It is all right so far.
What are you going to do about it?
Tom says that's his favorite store.
I was advised to do that.
How much should I pay?
What's your favorite sandwich?
Hokkaido is to the north of Honshu.
I thought Tom knew Mary.
I wasn't the one who told Tom to leave.
I'll never be able to forget you.
You and I both know that's not true.
I think it's necessary for you to see him.
My brother was killed in a traffic accident.
Are you satisfied?
Nothing happened to Tom.
I have a persistent cough.
Are you ready for this?
I wonder if you ever think of me.
The contract expires today.
Please go straight.
Wolves wander in the woods.
I don't think that anyone suspected that you weren't Tom.
The company is on the verge of bankruptcy.
What advice did Tom give you?
You're in terrible danger.
Tom won't wait for us.
I have to wait for Tom's call.
Can you suggest something else?
The toilet is upstairs.
Tom's neighbors called 911.
Why did you tell Tom I was here?
I've been sitting here all night.
I cried.
They drink coke.
You really seem to dislike spinach.
Please be sure to let me know your new address soon.
Tom and I have a son.
Do you know what it is like to be really hungry?
Tom was three years old when his mother died.
Tom wants to play golf with Mary's father.
I just don't want to sing right now.
Yesterday I did not play tennis.
I think I left something here.
Tom couldn't do what he was asked to do.
Are you illiterate?
Tom is complaining to the manager.
You drank too much.
That's the book I've been looking for.
It's blank.
Tell us about your new book.
I'm never at home on Sundays.
Don't say a word to me.
Many Americans did not have jobs.
You should've told your parents about us a long time ago.
You looked at me.
He came to my house on the pretext of seeing me.
Nothing's impossible for God.
Tom felt fine.
I can't find my keys.
My mom is worried.
It's good that you were able to come.
Did you get her letter?
I feel like life is passing me by.
Tom wants a telescope.
Do you smell that?
Tom has good teachers.
Aren't you glad you didn't go to Boston?
You should tell Tom not to do that.
Does your mother know about this?
We have an answer.
I'll go with you and Tom.
I'll make us something to eat.
What'll you do there?
Either Tom is lying or Mary is lying.
Speak to Tom in French.
You don't need to go there.
It was in the news.
I wish I knew how to help you.
Tom and Mary discussed their plans for the future.
Tom says he dreams about Mary every night.
Tom left quickly.
He loves attention.
Stop acting like a spoiled child.
We have nothing to hide.
Do you think Tom was satisfied with the results?
The big tree was struck by lightning.
This package isn't heavy.
Tom chaired the meeting.
Tom's idea seemed good to me.
Did it work?
We have different points of view.
You have provided me with some very useful advice.
Tom said he regretted not following Mary's advice.
He showed it to me.
Men are pigs.
I have more money than Tom has.
"I'm Japanese, the boy answered."
Tom began singing.
Tom says he's unsure.
We all know what happened here.
I don't eat as much as I used to.
I'm not even sure whether Tom will come or not.
I owe you $30.
I know that you shouldn't do that.
I'm going to correct this.
We have to stop this.
I don't know how that could happen.
How was your job interview?
I learned how to cook from Tom.
I can't stand the cold.
Tom is ignoring you.
What frightened Tom?
I can tell you how to avoid the mistakes I made.
I thought Tom was drunk.
Tom shut the window.
I thought you might change.
I'd rather be hanged than shot.
Tom knocked Mary down.
Tom is a truck driver.
How long is this movie?
I can't get Tom to eat spinach.
Tom has changed his mind.
I guess I should get home to my wife.
Open the doors.
Tom bought himself one.
What do you want from me?
We don't have that.
His son disappeared seven years ago.
I can't be much older than you are.
I left my phone in the car.
The hotel does not permit guests to keep pets.
We'll definitely invite Tom.
Don't be naive.
I want to know why Tom couldn't come.
I think it's time for dinner.
We need all the help we can get.
Why don't you do it yourself?
"Don't tell them the truth, OK?"
Tom lost his car keys.
I've already explained that.
Tom is an arrogant idiot.
He is a living fossil!
I finished my sandwich.
You're both right.
She's at a meeting.
How is everything?
What impression do you have of China?
I want to be certain you are who you say you are.
I like that sweater.
Wait for me here.
This is getting interesting.
We want to be here for Tom.
Perhaps we should tell Tom about what happened.
Don't turn the light on.
You've got company.
Tom didn't say anything about what he had done.
We must keep a diary every day.
Fires happen all the time in this area.
I didn't know Tom was born in Australia.
Someone is inside.
We know it was you that broke the window.
You should've kept it secret.
Tom is a comic book villain.
It might be a wedding.
I told Tom what happened.
I'll tell you what to buy.
I'm working.
October is over.
Are you still up?
That sounds strange.
Tom asked Mary to the prom.
Will you translate this into French?
Tom's hungry.
Tom needs to know somebody cares.
Fresh air is necessary to good health.
I don't know what to buy.
"I have to lose weight, so I'm on a diet."
Even Tom spoke French.
She is listening to him.
Do we have a deal?
I'm driving.
I've already had a cup of coffee.
Tom made it back safely.
I don't know anything about it.
The water flows under the bridge.
I'm sorry for being late.
Tom and Mary flew to Boston last Monday.
Why is life so hard?
Tom says he'll correct it.
I don't know if I can come.
Tom was present.
Let's hope you're mistaken.
Why did you say that?
Some people are difficult to please.
It'll be hard to convince Tom to sell his house.
They understood that.
Let me know if you have any problems.
Who did Tom want to talk to?
I'm buying meat and vegetables.
Tom and Mary are back.
Tom has a flip phone.
Tom didn't know how to cope with the problem.
The enemy dropped many bombs on the factory.
It was snowing when I woke up.
Tom earned a lot of money.
Why is it locked?
What are you wearing?
Tom didn't come today.
Are you sure you just want water?
Tom definitely lied.
He took a deep breath.
It's a pain that doesn't go away.
"In my place, Tom would've done the same."
"Will you go? ""I will if I have to."""
I feel great.
I'd like to work with you.
He doesn't care much for baseball.
I'm still a bit groggy.
They won't be happy until we're all dead.
Tom peeled the apple for Mary.
I'm talking.
"Hello, girls."
Tom won't be missed.
He went shopping.
Everyone hates us.
Tom gave Mary the cold shoulder.
I have to do my best.
You can't go there.
Can anyone verify that?
Tom died last night.
You are the best.
Tom said Mary was pessimistic.
Did you want to speak with me?
That company produces microchips.
Is this what you want?
Tom said it cost too much.
Tom is the only one who knows what we have to do.
Tom is a drunkard.
Have you received a letter from him?
I'd like to borrow this.
"You really do change your opinions often, don't you?"
The telephone is a means of communication.
He fell and hit his head on the floor.
My father stopped drinking.
Here you are.
Tom was somewhere else.
Tom didn't say so.
You had better consult the others.
My mommy and daddy will love me no matter what.
Where do you think we are?
Do it for Tom and me.
We ought to be ready for whatever comes.
Did Tom make it back all right?
Tom is much shorter than I am.
Tom seems to be in a really good mood today.
I had hardly left home when it began raining.
Listen to me.
I'll show you to your room.
The boy adjusted his cap.
I remember singing that song long ago.
I brought you something.
I don't remember seeing it before.
Everybody ignored us.
We hope Tom will see it.
She asked him to help her father clean the garage.
I'm going to work as a builder with my father.
I went by train.
Do you want to watch this program?
I saw him enter the house.
I don't know Tom's brother.
Tom is going back to his hotel.
His eyes are red.
Tom started to talk.
Is she single or married?
This bicycle belongs to me.
Does it offend you?
You're very direct.
When can I see you?
I've never ridden a horse.
What can be more important than that?
Tom wrote a book on that subject.
We are not amused.
Tom has asked us to buy him something to eat.
"Why aren't you going? ""Because I don't want to."""
People need hope.
I hope I didn't wake you up.
Did you wash your hands?
Can I borrow yours?
Tom bent down and touched his toes.
The two candidates are neck and neck.
You are what you are.
You have a secret admirer.
I'll sweep the floor while you wash the dishes.
I was the only one who survived.
Tom and Mary kissed one another.
Tom forgot to bring his camera.
Please take Tom with you.
Tom has a wife and a three-year-old daughter.
It is going to rain very soon.
They were finished.
Tom walked into his apartment.
Tom hasn't gotten his driver's license yet.
Seven policemen were killed.
You sound just like Tom.
I have several meetings this afternoon.
This shirt costs more than fifty dollars.
I followed you.
Tom is a very rich person.
Tom is in a hurry to catch the train.
Tom didn't want to be a surgeon.
I don't want to attend the party.
Do you have any children you haven't told me about?
Can I use the bathroom?
I'm sure that'll help.
The plane left after a three-hour delay.
Aren't you going to eat?
It was their choice.
I did some shopping on my way home.
Why doesn't Tom want to go?
It is difficult for me.
Tom's conduct was beyond reproach.
Somebody should put Tom in his place.
Why is Tom even here?
All of us like you.
I'll be here all week.
That's my specialty.
Guess what I've got.
Tom had a feeling that the plan wouldn't work.
"He isn't here, is he?"
I just didn't want to do that.
I don't want to work with you.
What's your wife's name?
Tom was the only man at the meeting.
Tom is playing it cool.
He could not bear to think of his dog being sold to that cruel man.
I hear that his father is abroad.
He is the principal of the high school.
There is a bookstore in front of my house.
Tom thought quite highly of you.
We're fed up with your complaining.
The chances of being attacked by a shark are very low.
Tom takes a shower before breakfast.
We talked about this and that.
This report has many typos.
Please stop beating around the bush and come straight to the point.
Tom is cold and tired.
That's a cheap store.
Do you have this in a bigger size?
Tom is out.
I haven't accomplished anything yet.
It was a close match.
"By signing a contract, you agree to certain terms and conditions."
He was completely honest.
I wonder if life exists on other planets.
Tom knows this is the truth.
Most Hollywood movies have happy endings.
Do you know what happened here?
I already know what your opinion is.
I had a lot of help.
Why do stars twinkle?
Tom was in the room.
I know why Tom was doing that.
You're comparing apples and oranges.
I know that Tom helped you.
She put by some money for a rainy day.
I wish it would stop raining.
It doesn't exist.
I can't explain it.
We're making money.
Tom has never seen Mary naked.
Tom was eliminated in the second round of the contest.
The Qutub Minar and Red Fort are in Delhi.
Can we give Tom a ride?
That's a beautiful ring.
Is that all you've got to say?
You need to drink more water.
Tom didn't complain.
Is Tom lost?
Drop it.
Tom is taking a shower.
Are you taller than Tom?
I don't ever want to see you again.
You told me to come here.
Are you sure you don't want to wait till tomorrow?
It's my fault that you were fired.
I will always remember you.
Tom quit his job yesterday.
We don't usually do that.
Tom seems very friendly today.
Do as I asked.
Don't you recognize that guy?
I feel so lonely.
Tom doesn't have a girlfriend.
Tom thought that Mary was asking too many questions.
You should go there by taxi.
Tom said he was present at yesterday's meeting.
How much was it?
I'll go straight home.
"Hey, we aren't done yet."
I think Tom is just curious.
"Tom said he'd do that, so you don't have to."
There wasn't anything like enough light to read by.
I have a different opinion on that subject.
I wrote a book about China.
It's OK with me if you take that book.
I seldom wear a hat.
"You knew, didn't you?"
The baby was taken care of by its grandmother.
It's not too hard to do that.
Tom has an iPhone.
I have the feeling I've already seen this movie.
Tom is serious now.
Tom didn't have time to finish eating.
I just received some very disturbing information.
I often eat bananas.
Just give me my money.
We were late as a result of the traffic jam.
Tom isn't the only one here who doesn't know what to do.
I can't afford that.
What did he do after that?
I couldn't have done this without him.
Please tell me again how to do this.
We'll have to pull an all-nighter.
Tom is engaged to be married.
Tom has a twin brother named John.
Did you know Tom worked there?
Accidents have increased in number.
Didn't you know that your door was open?
I'm always proud of my family.
We all have secrets.
"Surprisingly, he swims even on cold days."
We're basketball players.
Look around you.
That's too expensive.
Tom told me you were crazy.
I don't have time to worry about you.
Can you wait?
Tom is still full of energy.
I like corn dogs.
Where did you go last Sunday?
We'll make sure of it.
Tom knew I'd be awake.
Tom was wrong.
This flower is yellow and the others are blue.
Why didn't you answer your phone?
I know you don't like chocolate.
Does Tom ever forget anything?
Did you know Tom had a son?
I know you feel helpless.
Tom wrote a message on a slip of paper.
Are you still doing your homework?
They had big plans for you.
"Why is it OK for men to do that, but not women?"
Sorry for being so late.
We'll go.
Is it true that Tom can't swim?
Mary never wears makeup.
Thank you for the help.
Japanese tourists can be found everywhere.
I need to talk with you.
Can it be repaired?
You have to come with me.
My cat loves toys.
What happens if I say no?
Don't get married.
We walked out of the movie.
She decided to go.
What do you like to do on Sundays?
We want something new.
Tom's wife doesn't know Mary's husband.
You must be Tom's brother.
There's a garden behind our house.
Watch out! There's a big hole there.
This is always the way it has been.
You have to be prepared for anything.
She is wearing a hat.
Tom said he didn't want to travel with Mary.
Do you want to work for us?
I'm in low spirits today.
How am I going to get out of here?
Everybody wants to win.
It's the only thing I can think of.
I'll use my imagination.
She is more famous than you.
I'm not leaving here.
Tom guessed the right answer.
Tom always gets up early in the morning.
I hate my boss.
You need to save the princess.
Tom swears a lot.
I was completely shocked.
Tom was carried off the ice on a stretcher.
We were both very sleepy.
Do you speak Chinese?
Tom made it on time.
Tom won't answer.
Save your voice.
I thought you wanted to wait.
How did he do this?
You're the only one to survive the attack.
"First, Tom read several passages from the Bible."
They all went to bed.
Why are you back so soon?
Tom is a very gifted young man.
"How old are you? ""I'm 16 years old."""

He shouted at the top of his voice.
Who lives in that house?
Are you sure I can't help?
I came on Monday.
"You're the expert, Tom."
Please give me my bag.
I thought you had a date.
We have to get him to the hospital before it's too late.
I told you everything I knew.
Tom is swimming.
"Where are you from, Tom?"
Everybody knows what Tom is doing.
Tom bought a mask and a snorkel so he could go snorkeling with his friends.
I don't know what else there is to discuss.
"Tom's death was an accident. ""Are you sure?"""
I want Tom to hear your story.
I've lost my strength.
This book is full of errors.
Aren't you working today?
"I'm sorry to say, but the service isn't very good."
"Yes, I did that."
I was waiting for you.
Is it too small?
I suspect Tom didn't do that.
I don't want to go swimming with you.
He is sometimes absent from school.
Do you wanna talk?
I am glad that you have returned safe.
There are many good reasons not to do it.
"We are the same age, but different heights."
Don't even talk to Tom.
I will deal with this problem.
Tom and Mary didn't kiss.
Tom has won three races in a row.
How much money do you owe?
Don't you want my phone number?
Both Tom and Mary don't like John.
The priest pronounced them man and wife.
Men talk about women all the time.
I need to discuss that with Tom.
The story ends with his death.
"Yesterday, I lost my wallet."
Tom stood up and walked to the window.
My mother told me to behave myself.
Are you giving me another chance?
We've only got thirty minutes.
I forgot the map.
He doesn't know what he's talking about.
Tom struggled to climb to the top.
I got divorced.
"Luckily, nobody was killed in the fire."
I want you to take me back home.
"If I were you, I'd refuse to do that."
I want to meet your older sister.
Tom works at a call center.
Tom isn't like us.
Tom had a heart attack and died in his sleep.
How about getting me another glass of wine?
Do you want coffee now or later?
I don't know why Tom is late.
I think I'll take that.
You must find work.
I heard Tom screaming.
Don't interrupt me while I am talking.
Tom went to the circus with Mary.
I'm glad to see that you're happy.
This isn't so rare.
I can't tell you how stupid this makes me feel.
It's Tom's birthday.
Tom wanted to lose weight.
Don't eat the oysters.
Tom put new pedals on the bicycle that he rides to school.
I suspect that Tom and Mary don't like spinach.
Tom would lend you money if you asked him to.
Aren't you going to sing?
The sky has become overcast.
What're we waiting for?
The lake was frozen.
You're going to be a father.
That is a leather belt.
This package was delivered last night.
I'd like to be alone if you don't mind.
You look good without your glasses.
Tell me what happened to Tom.
You underestimate your importance.
Everything was fine.
I can't believe we fell for that.
Why are you telling me all this?
Tom doesn't often eat at home.
How unlucky I am!
Humans are very capricious beings.
I think that jacket would fit me.
Tom reserved a seat.
Do you have a suggestion?
The Golden Gate Bridge is made of iron.
Look at that cat.
Tom is thick-headed.
Do you want to see them?
Tom was hoping he wouldn't need to do that.
The police could not control the mob.
Tom's eyes are blue.
We have two boats.
I wasn't so lucky.
I wouldn't mind stretching my legs a little.
I think you should take the day off.
There is wet paint on the door.
Tom is a bus driver.
That will be a problem.
I don't belong to any club.
Tom knocked on the door again.
Tom is playing tennis.
Tom isn't very busy today.
I needed you and Tom.
My father made a shelf for me.
Tom said losing isn't much fun.
Mastering a foreign language calls for patience.
Tom closed the curtains.
It's lunch time.
"Do you work there, too?"
Tom looks just like you.
Was that what you were afraid of?
These require careful handling.
Tom must be in Australia.
Why did you give money to Tom?
Do you have a bike?
Don't tell your mother.
Tom didn't want it to happen that way.
Don't be afraid to get your feet wet.
I'll teach you what you need to know.
I deliver pizzas.
"You have a thing for Mary, don't you?"
I'm related to you.
Do you have a plan?
What was Tom doing exactly?
This is not my home.
Have you told Tom I'm here?
I think you need to spend a little more time on your homework.
We have lots to do.
I don't like swimming.
Tom refused to move.
Tom poisoned Mary's dog.
Who are your most interesting friends?
Can art change the world?
Don't you see Tom?
Will you go?
Put your hat on.
How much did you cut off?
I would like to kiss you.
Why are you so pale?
Tom stole my girlfriend.
Let us sit down.
I married a Canadian.
He accused us of wronging him.
Let go of my arm.
Tom is hiding.
Close the window before you leave.
Do you believe it?
My dog needs a walk.
I am a translator.
Nobody knows you're my cousin.
Tom won't be able to get there in time.
I'd like to do that.
I always enjoy listening to classical music when I have some free time.
Please begin immediately.
I couldn't do anything about it.
I just want to visit Tom.
Tom claimed that he didn't kill anybody.
I bought a camera.
Be polite to your parents.
Follow Tom.
I didn't know you had a brother.
The station is a ten minute drive from here.
I just wasn't paying attention.
I knew something like this would happen.
"In any case, it's none of your business."
Mary is playing with her dolls.
Tom wanted you to know.
They waved flags to welcome the princess.
What's the tallest building in Boston?
When does the performance begin?
Give the flashlight to me.
Tom is doing OK.
Stop hiding your head in the sand.
Please wrap it up.
What you said made everyone angry.
Tom poured the remaining beer into the sink.
Tom advised Mary not to go.
Tom doesn't wear a watch.
Tom helped me fix my watch.
Tom didn't flinch.
I have a frog in my throat.
It is no wonder that you are turning down the proposal.
He is having lunch.
"When Tom woke up, everything was covered with snow."
I know that that isn't true.
That's something I hadn't figured on.
I didn't think you'd see us.
I accidentally shot myself in the leg.
We've got to call Tom.
I knew Tom was coming back.
Tom said that he had no money.
Is it bad?
You can't go to Boston this weekend.
Are we prepared?
Why did you try to run away?
Bring backup.
"I tried the door, but it was locked."
Pay attention to what Tom says.
Tom has finally succeeded.
It has had no effect on him.
I asked Tom why he wasn't here yesterday.
I cannot agree with you on this point.
Tom doesn't have much free time.
You shouldn't trust anyone.
You have a very beautiful daughter.
I thought you didn't see anything.
I can't find the address of my hotel.
Tom shops online.
Tom told me that I shouldn't go out alone at night.
Tell me where the supermarket is.
Will you look after my dog tomorrow?
Tom smiled hesitantly.
I didn't think you'd get here so soon.
I went to bed later than usual.
I wish you hadn't tried to help.
Tom just told me that he doesn't plan to stay in Boston.
Tom refused to sign the document.
This telescope must be used carefully.
Tom doesn't let his children drink wine.
Wait for Tom.
He knows how to learn a language quickly.
Tell Tom that I don't need his help.
I just don't want to go with you.
I don't want to burden you with my troubles.
Tom said that he regretted the decision.
Tom said he was looking for you.
"Do I have to do that, too?"
Tom grabbed a handful of popcorn out of the bag and then handed it to Mary.
I made friends with a student from abroad.
I think Tom has never been to Australia.
We're coming in.
He asked me out on a date.
Were there any glasses on the table?
What did you do for Tom?
Tom is terribly jealous.
Don't leave the TV on.
I hope to marry her.
Do you think there's a chance?
Are you Tom by any chance?
Have you spoken with Tom?
He's not stronger than me.
It doesn't rain here very often.
I suggest you visit Boston.
She came down to breakfast at eight.
I have never heard him speak English.
Tom and Mary ran into the air-raid shelter.
Didn't you know Tom was living in Australia?
We know what you're capable of.
Tom bought a dress for Mary.
He turned out to be innocent.
Everybody knows them.
Tom and I are getting married in October.
No one I know likes Tom.
I know it's difficult to believe.
You can't choose your parents.
Tom is the leader.
I should apologize to Tom.
The ancient Greeks knew as much about the solar system as we do.
We're going to need them.
We had to stop.
Do you remember who I am?
We import a lot of things from Australia.
I don't think that Tom knows where Mary is right now.
"I know Tom doesn't like Mary, but I don't know why."
Where does that road lead?
I'm proud of the work I've done here.
He likes to watch TV.
It seems pretty easy.
Can you promise me you won't do that?
Tom pretended to be asleep.
A tiger has escaped from the zoo.
How long will we have to wait?
Don't pretend you don't know what I'm talking about.
Tell me what you're doing here.
You make me so happy.
I don't think that I'll play tennis today.
Tom wanted to be a writer.
It wouldn't be hard to do that.
What would you have done?
Tom doesn't look reassured.
You look happy today.
Come in.
Tom saw Mary in the park.
I'm going to hide somewhere near here.
I suspect Tom has already left for Australia.
Is Tom injured?
"The sea got rough, so that we had to give up fishing."
We're all related.
Ring the bell in an emergency.
You'll have a hard time.
Life's not fair.
Our guests are arriving.
I hope no one sees me like this.
They saw me.
We've got thirty minutes.
I'd like to try that myself.
"If I can do that, so can you."
You're always dissatisfied.
Many innocent people were killed.
Do you know where Tom could have hidden his money?
It is not as good as it looks.
Everyone looked happy.
Tom refused to sign the contract.
The answer's tricky.
You're with friends.
Tom couldn't figure out what Mary was trying to say.
You don't know what it's like.
He is daydreaming.
I want to wait for the right moment.
This was in Tom's safe.
I drank some juice.
It is a curse.
I have to send these letters.
I feed my dog twice a day.
I'm going to need a bigger room.
Are you going to eat that bread?
We don't know whether to believe Tom or not.
Do you like ancient history?
"I think you've had enough, Tom."
Tom is now short of money.
I can make a distinction between good and bad.
I love the way you hold me.
Please buy me something to eat.
Where's the other one?
You have a point there.
Didn't you hear me shouting?
I'm sorry that I didn't believe you.
How many people will come?
Did you call me up last night?
There isn't time to explain.
Tom has decided to put off his departure.
He seldom writes to his father.
Is Tom big?
"This is a lot of fun, isn't it?"
Please have some cake.
This is his.
I saw Tom yesterday.
I'm still waiting for my order.
I am smart.
Please take me to Tom.
You look awful.
He was the first man to cross the Pacific.
Tom has achieved a lot.
When is your flight?
Tom intends to become a journalist.
"Tom, are you busy?"
I told you everything I remember.
How much candy did Tom eat yesterday?
He likes to work in the garden.
Don't you want to know where I'm going?
"Where's Tom? ""He's at home."""
I don't remember anymore.
I was just about to say the same thing.
How did you get here so fast?
Don't make a scene.
Where is this money coming from?
I'm flabby.
Does Tom have fire insurance?
I want you to behave yourself.
That has no bearing on the matter.
She is too young to understand that her father died.
How would that help?
Tom isn't doing any harm.
Only a few drops of rain have fallen.
I still say it wasn't a good idea.
Tom recommended this book to me.
That's Tom's room.
Where do you park?
You're Tom's friend.
"You don't believe it, do you?"
Did you hear Tom is leaving?
There will be an economic crisis at the end of this year.
Tom asked the teacher some questions.
I hope that we can be friends.
The situation is improving.
No one will be fired.
That's fantastic!
Did you buy these for Tom?
Bring me something to eat.
Is Tom still crying?
Listen to me very carefully.
Lead is much heavier than aluminum.
I have to see this.
Tom's dog started to bark.
Is that going to be a problem?
You're a murderer.
Life begins at forty.
We talked with the owner of the house.
There was no point in denying it.
Can I get you some tea?
Tom and I'll always be friends.
Help yourself to something.
This firm manufactures cars at the rate of two hundred per day.
All of my friends have bicycles.
Is that your mother?
Tom has agreed to babysit the kids Monday evening.
"Tom wasn't very hungry, so he didn't eat much."
Tom's barn was struck by lightning twice last year.
Tom began drinking heavily after his wife died.
Tell me who else is on your list.
Tom burned a hole in his coat.
There's another option.
Mary lost her husband in a car accident.
"The longer I live, the smarter I get."
The man walking over there is our teacher.
Tom would like to speak with you.
Tom believes in the existence of the soul.
You haven't told me why you asked me to come here.
It is time you told her the truth.
That sounds like another lie.
The snow melted away in a day.
Tom noticed a change in Mary.
She is very beautiful.
Tom and Mary are planning to move to Boston.
My family's not rich.
Tom is crying in his car.
"Since I have no children, I have more time to spend doing volunteer work than parents do."
You're a true gentleman.
Weren't you at home last night?
Tom asked me if I was all right.
I got my hearing tested.
Tell me why you're angry.
I was dreaming.
Many museums are closed on Mondays.
The house was struck by lightning yesterday.
What time do you eat breakfast?
Cut it out.
Buy me some candy.
Were you successful?
I took my shoes off and put them under the bed.
Tom sat on a park bench.
Did you show it to Tom?
It was cheaper than I thought it would be.
We're going to be fine.
Mary told me that she loved me.
If we go this way we'll catch up with them.
I'm ready to go back home.
Let's go to Tom's.
I don't want you to stay.
I told Tom that was ridiculous.
Tom will be very happy to see you.
I thought I recognized you.
I still can't believe Mary and I are getting married.
I can't save you.
Tom is very sad.
Tom thought he'd never see Mary again.
How can you be so calm?
Tom noticed that Mary was limping.
Tom's lawyer didn't think that the jury would think that Mary was a reliable witness.
You drink too much coffee.
The sky is full of stars.
Tom used to have a sports car.
She has more books.
Tom is unlikely to find what he's looking for.
We better be going.
Hear me out.
Tom helped Mary in the garden.
You're the only one who knows how to do this.
I said I would try.
I'll be in the kitchen.
We all got distracted.
Tom doesn't like it when Mary does that.
Let's be optimistic.
What Chinese food do you like?
I'll be alone.
Tell me where I am.
Tom has a blue car.
Can we stop there?
What's your plan for tomorrow?
A guy named Tom came to see you.
Just let go of the rope.
I usually eat a lot.
I don't think Tom knows why Mary is ignoring him.
Tom asked Mary when the last time she had bought a book was.
Tom is going to get help.
We know our rights.
The ice will crack under your weight.
Will anyone else be there?
Tom's train left five minutes ago.
Tom isn't in the mood for this.
How can we kill time?
"I ought to go there, but I won't."
Tom will never let me do that.
How did you sleep last night?
It's a rumor.
She is sitting on the bench.
I looked outside.
He has gone blind in both eyes.
I think it's a terrible law.
There are no broken bones.
He wants to work in a hospital.
When are you going to buy that?
Don't leave me alone.
I think I'll stay a while longer.
Let's think outside the box.
You can always ask for Tom's help.
Tom told me he'd try to win.
We can hear.
I think you're both right.
Tom moved away from the window.
I threw a stone at the bird.
Could you give me a little help?
We obeyed the rules.
I got out of the taxi.
Tom wants to see how we'll do this.
Get to the point.
I just woke up.
I spoke slowly so that they might understand me.
I'm trying to win.
There's hardly anything left.
May I suggest something?
She opened a new store.
"Oh, come on."
Tom must consider carefully whether he really wants a divorce or not.
Greeks also eat a lot of fish.
I didn't know that Tom was older than you.
Have you called an ambulance yet?
I told Tom to stop.
I know that Tom isn't very busy.
I raised my hand to ask a question.
I saw Tom leave the room.
I have a few questions for you.
I think you've got a really bad attitude.
I'll come again tomorrow.
I was trying to protect you.
It seems like the cat smelled a mouse.
I'm dripping with sweat.
Aren't you tired of doing this?
You can't be at two places at once.
Tom tried to trick Mary.
I can't think of any reason not to tell Tom what happened.
Tom knew Mary was unlikely to win.
I know what I like.
We're always complaining.
Write your name and address.
Do you want me to answer?
The day isn't over yet.
I doubt that Tom planned to spend so much time on that project.
I remember having seen her somewhere.
He will look after the cats for me while I'm abroad.
I turned on the lights.
Give me a call tonight.
Please don't speak to me.
That's a very beautiful picture.
It's for you.
He took a book from the shelf.
I wanted to meet you.
I wish you spoke French.
Why is life so difficult?
It was Tom who taught me how to do this.
What makes you think Tom hates you?
Tom can advise you.
Where did Tom go?
I want you to take me back to Boston.
I didn't want to get up early.
Tom drummed his fingers on the table.
OK. I agree.
It was six o'clock.
"As long as you keep quiet, you can stay in this room."
Tom and I could sing together.
Please turn left at the first corner.
Tom can stay at our place.
We've decided to remove Tom from life support.
We were unsure what kind of person Tom would be and whether he would like living in the same house as us.
I think that Tom knows what he's doing.
I think you know that Tom isn't going to be here today.
I'm looking forward to going to Boston.
Everything is clear.
You should come to Boston.
My sister will be thirteen years old next summer.
He was sentenced to prison.
There are wounds that time does not heal.
I thought that you already had a ticket.
Let me have a look at those photos.
Do you take sugar in your coffee?
He has a strong sense of responsibility.
Do you have any pictures I can look at?
I'd like to buy a wooden spoon.
Something strange is going on.
I don't feel like dancing now.
Tom won't likely do that today.
Losing my daughter has taken away my will to live.
Did you see Tom in Boston?
Tom beat Mary black and blue.
Tom has decided to go skiing next weekend.
Where did Tom get the money to pay for all this?
They all look the same.
"They stayed at home, because it rained."
I like the color green.
I really want to go.
You look younger.
Tom said that he was wrong.
Tom went to school by car.
Please give Tom this book.
I don't know him at all.
You should acknowledge your failure.
I'm glad you appreciated that.
Cut them with a knife.
I'm a lot bigger than you are.
Tom doesn't like the way Mary looks at him.
I don't think Tom is as selfish as everybody thinks he is.
Tom will never get out of prison.
I went to college with Tom.
Tom didn't understand.
We're all bound to die.
She boiled the eggs.
I've never noticed that before.
I want to talk to your mother.
It was handmade.
We had a nice time.
They stayed with me in the room all night.
Are you ashamed of me?
Please be careful.
How old was Tom when he moved to Australia?
Tom is taller than anybody else in his department.
Some people think that the voting age should be lowered to 16.
Tom is now old enough to do that.
I swore I'd never do that.
My father contracted pneumonia last month.
Mathematics was his weakest subject in school.
I heard a sound.
I know how to treat a lady.
Did I do that right?
There is someone here.
I have two sons and two daughters.
I've got a splitting headache.
How are you going to spend your weekend?
She couldn't keep from crying.
"Let me finish, OK?"
Tell me again what happened.
Is he a friend of yours?
"Sorry, I don't follow."
Just help me.
Is this your son?
You'll pay for what you did to me.
I didn't expect to see you again.
I take a shower every morning before I go to school.
I'm the owner of this land.
Tom is always in a bad mood.
"We see with our eyes, we hear with our ears, we touch with our skin, we smell with our nose, and we taste with our tongue."
The dog is dying.
I think I can speak French well enough to get by.
He ratted us out.
Be more careful from now on.
Tom spends a lot of time reading books.
Let me help you with your luggage.
The box is almost empty.
I doubt that Tom understands what we're talking about.
I'm afraid it may rain tomorrow.
Thanks again.
Tom says he regrets doing that.
Cut it out.
Tom sprinkled ashes on the icy sidewalk.
Tom was easy to find.
Were you home at ten?
Tom left an envelope on your desk.
How could I be so stupid?
It's fun to read my old diary.
Your ideas are a little old-fashioned.
Tom isn't working for me.
Tom escaped from jail through a tunnel.
You have no messages.
All you have to do is sign your name here.
French isn't that difficult.
I heard Tom talking to Mary.
I have a son who's sick.
I hope Tom continues to do that.
Let's turn off the TV.
Our new car is not very big.
Tom and Mary got married a few years ago.
He bought a car.
Everything seemed fine at first.
Tom knows what's going to happen.
Do you need it now?
Tom is a very interesting man.
Is it made of wood or metal?
Your hypothesis is plausible.
I forgot to ask Tom to do that.
That's right.
I didn't apologize.
What do you think of it?
Jackson could not believe it.
I'm going to get some sleep.
I don't speak any French.
The cat is dead.
I told Tom I was going to Australia.
Don't go too far away.
When did you get out of the hospital?
Tom has a bald spot.
I know you're hiding somewhere in this room.
The light was so bright that it hurt our eyes.
I want you to find Tom.
Tom called Mary a fool.
The police were accused of having used excessive force when arresting the demonstrators.
He has curly hair.
Thanks for all you've done.
I apologize for the delay in replying.
You can't just stand there and watch Tom die.
Where've you been?
When did you ask Tom?
Do you want to learn how to drive?
How did your weekend go?
Maybe she will not come.
I'm from a big family.
I opened the box and looked inside.
I've been waiting for you to wake up.
Tom looked at Mary and laughed.
I'll be quick.
I truly do not understand the question.
They looked tired.
Let us know whether you can come.
Have some ham.
Tom wasn't breaking the law.
What are their names?
Could you send someone up to make the bed?
How could they forget us?
Tell everyone the truth.
Tom tried to be polite.
I'm wearing a sweater because I feel cold.
Are you waiting for someone?
How many times have you done this?
Who's going with me?
I haven't forgotten you.
I know that you aren't ready.
I'll tell you how to do that.
This is bad.
Tom gave Mary John's phone number.
I doubt Tom will sing.
I was impressed.
I like winter.
Tom admitted defeat.
What'll you give me?
I got back from Boston yesterday.
"I saw Tom outside your door, eavesdropping."
Tom is very afraid of snakes.
I got an A in French.
How many cats does Tom have?
Have you looked in the bottom drawer?
Search dogs located the victim's body.
I asked them to call you.
I say it's worth a try.
Tom doesn't like my jokes.
I need some time.
Didn't you know Tom is in Boston now?
This book was translated from French.
What time is it by your clock?
Why did you like it?
That's the life Tom has chosen for himself.
They consider him their best employee.
Tom wouldn't listen to my advice.
Where should I sit?
Don't fight it. Just let yourself fall in love with me.
"I'd like to stay and chat, but I've got a meeting to go to."
How are things going at home?
Let's not invite Tom.
I'm finishing my homework.
Now I feel sorry for her.
The people revolted against their rulers.
I work in a post office during the summer holidays.
I had no idea that things were so bad.
What makes you think you're better than me?
Tom wasn't able to win yesterday.
We want to hire somebody who can speak French.
This candlestick is very heavy.
Tom isn't currently in prison.
How long have you been sitting there?
That's all going to change.
What do you intend to do?
I'm already thirty minutes late.
"As far as I know, he is reliable."
Tom said he'd wait for us.
Zucchinis are green.
Can I exchange this with something else?
The walls were painted white.
We have better weather today.
I remember that I gave him the key.
The cold is intense.
They went to the beach.
I know someone who can help you.
Tom told me he wanted to leave.
I know some of your students don't like you.
Do you want an apple?
How should I eat this?
You can count on it.
"If you want to, we'll go."
I just wanted to play baseball.
Tom liked that idea.
The door is open now.
Fill in this form.
Why don't you drop by sometime?
I think that it'll taste better if you add a little salt and pepper.
"Lucky at cards, unlucky in love."
I don't think that Tom will like this.
Please get in touch with me as soon as you arrive in Boston.
We'll wait for you here.
The joke is on Tom.
Tom hasn't told me anything.
You've got to help us.
How often do you ride a bicycle?
Tom's room was pretty clean.
The result was unexpected.
Tom told me you were still in Boston.
Why did you keep that a secret?
That was the only thing I had to do.
Do you still think Tom did that?
Tom wanted a dog.
We usually sleep in this room.
"If you don't go, I won't either."
Tom is going to need help.
We shouldn't give up.
Tom can help you out.
I'm forgetful.
Tom put on his shoes.
Did you go and see Tom?
"That is a large force with 5,000 soldiers."
Why are you here alone?
Will I still be able to do it?
I like to cook.
You can't always do what you want.
I don't remember when I took this picture.
No one agreed with Tom.
We have work to do.
I learned the truth from the letter.
Tom has already said he'll help us.
We live in a big city.
He had a new idea.
Tom wouldn't have done that alone.
A taxi to the airport costs about $30.
I haven't kissed Mary yet.
I'd like to know for sure.
Tom will tell the truth.
Don't hog the road.
I would give anything to win her back.
Did I fall asleep?
Did you enjoy your trip to Boston?
Tom was my only friend at that time.
Tom asked Mary some stupid questions that she refused to answer.
I read the most interesting book in my library.
They were grateful.
There are no mistakes in your composition.
Tell Tom that I'm hungry.
How did you know that I grew up in Australia?
Tom can't do anything.
You must break the vicious circle.
"We met in 2008. A year later, we got married."
The others will arrive in a few minutes.
Why are you angry with Tom?
I know you're smart.
Are you sure Tom won't be here?
Tom shut his mouth.
I'm ugly.
I'm a busboy.
Thank you for your letter.
"Anyway, it's not your problem."
I told you I could do that.
Tom thinks I'm very stupid.
I don't think we can get home by Monday.
Tom was afraid to cross the street.
Napoleon was exiled to the island of Elba in 1814.
Are you planning something?
I left in a hurry.
I didn't know you believed in ghosts.
I won't be long.
"For me, it's not acceptable."
You're no friend of mine.
Tom had no other choice.
Tom asked Mary not to leave.
Don't talk to Tom about this.
I want to buy a five kilo bag of rice.
He has to support his mother and his sister.
We won't be able to help Tom.
What'll you eat?
Do you mean you're giving up?
"You made that mistake on purpose, didn't you?"
We were younger then.
You're better than Tom.
I didn't ask Tom where he'd gone.
Tom died of old age.
Don't put your elbows on the table.
Who did Tom sing with?
The man is well-known all over the village.
Have you thought about what we talked about the other night?
His mobile has been stolen.
Protestants were in the majority.
Tom drinks coffee to stay awake when he's studying at night.
I still haven't told Tom how to do that.
Tom works in a hospital.
Tom said he was shocked.
I don't like sewing because I can't thread the needle.

Tom lost it.
Can you open it?
Could you do that for me?
Tom is staying with us.
She has been busy preparing for her trip to the U.S.
Tom is a maniac.
You won't be shot.
I wish my grandmother had seen it.
Everybody here but Tom has done that.
Your name was on the list.
Tom has finally finished doing that.
I have a friend whose wife is a pianist.
I would like to go with you.
They let me go.
The hospital food wasn't as bad as I expected it to be.
Do we have time to watch another movie?
I need to do it now.
Please put your shirt on.
Why is your French so good?
I told you to leave me alone.
Tom tore up the letter.
We're planning a party.
The gang was planning a robbery.

The teacher explained to us the meaning of the poem.
It's not going to rain this evening.
This dress fits me very well.
They don't sell it.
Tom wasn't very sick.
Do Tom and John usually wear ties to work?
Tom didn't tell you the whole truth.
I hoped Tom would do that.
I love my job.

"I have a stomachache, doctor."
He wanted to meet me.
You must've been wrong.
The rooms are deserted.
It's a big hospital.
Tom is Mary's closest friend.
He is said to have been born in Africa.
Ask him what to do next.
Tom gave me Mary's phone number.
Tom is alone in his bedroom.
You're ugly.
I don't like paying taxes.
I'll do what Tom says.
You live in my heart.
What can you give us?
She lived in the suburbs of Tokyo when she was young.
Tom drank coffee and Mary drank tea.
Don't drink beer before going to bed.
"Were you there, too?"
She married a musician.
It's unlikely she's as stupid as you think.
Do you think Tom will accept my invitation?
I have no clue what you're talking about.
Tom got into the driver's seat and drove off.
This stain won't come out.
Where were all of you?
I can't make out what you're saying.
Can I try it on?
I met one of your students.
I was thinking the same thing.
I don't know what Tom wants to do.
Tom plans to buy a new motorcycle.
That won't be easy for me to do.
I know Tom let you down.
Turn the volume up.
Go on board.
I know Tom's wife.
Where is the hotel?
How did you know that would happen?
I kicked the ball.
What else did Tom do?
I told Tom I intended to do that.
Did you take your pills?
Help me lift it.
Tom does want to do that.
I don't know which one.
It's unlikely our team will win.
Our train arrived on time.
I doubt that Tom is still asleep.
My kids don't usually lie to me.
Remove the chicken's giblets before cooking.
This is enough for me.
I hear you're from Boston.
They're rich.
That happens to all of us.
I am going abroad this summer.
Tom got a job.
Is that your husband?
Thanks for the compliment.
I bought a new chair for my office.
She looks sad.
Look at the price.
Isn't there anything you can do?
Tom has a beautiful car.
Let's do some exercise to work up an appetite.
Whales can remain submerged for a long time.
We don't think it matters.
I couldn't understand Tom's explanation.
Who brought this?
It's a secret.
Do you think Tom is cold?
I am on the right.
I will pick you up around six.
What were you talking about?
I suddenly lost my appetite.
Why don't you let Tom win?
"So, what is it you want me to say?"
I've tried to contact you.
Get away from Tom.
Stop yelling!
Tom could barely speak French.
I would do it if Tom asked me to.
It is only a short walk from the station.
Why do I have to go?
I know that Tom is intelligent.
Tom turned and walked away.
There's no way to translate it.
Tom will look at it.
You're insane.
You know that better than I do.
I'm not a big fan of blueberry pancakes.
I'll never let that happen again.
Tom quit his job last week.
Tom is your age.
I think it's necessary.
I'm miserable.
I don't have your number.
You've got to be ready for anything.
We can build that.
Be careful not to be late.
Tom robbed a bank in Boston.
"Tom is doing that to help Mary, not me."
What would we do without you?
Stop putting off finding a job.
"Eventually, Tom will realize that he needs help."
You don't have to work on Sundays.
I put the money in a three-year time deposit at the bank.
Tom did as I told him.
I'd think that the last thing you'd want to do right now is talk to Tom.
That can't be possible.
"There's something I've been wanting to ask you, Tom."
I guess we could.
What do you think they were doing all morning?
Our new home has an elevator.
Why are you here alone?
I warned you that Tom was coming.
I'm crazy about Tom.
We live together now.
Tom says we can start without him.
Have you paid your phone bill?
I love to fish.
Who do you blame?
Tom lived in Boston for years.
"Judging from her appearance, she seems to be very rich."
I'm afraid Tom will say no.
"Do as I say, not as I do."
I went to the library to read a book.
Tom doesn't play golf.
Do you want me to lock the door?

Tom has friends.
I demand you give me back my money.

Tom was dead drunk.
I'll gain weight again!
I'll put your name on the list.

The burglars broke into the bank at night.
Tom told me that my hair was too long.
Why do you need a new ladder?
This will be great.
Tom usually plays tennis on Mondays.
Keep your promises.
Tom said Mary seemed to be drunk.
He called at my house.
"Unfortunately, that hasn't happened."
Tom is proud of his stamp collection.
I can't remember very much.
Please call before you come.
What did you ask Tom?
I stayed in Boston over three months.
Don't listen to Tom.
Tom wasn't traveling.
I think everyone makes mistakes.
Tom didn't know how to do it.
You are lying.
Tom has a beautiful wife.
All those flowers look alike.
Do you know who stole my bicycle?
That's a reasonable question.
"Tom grew up near a lake, but he isn't a good swimmer."
What's the Wi-Fi password?
Tom has a secret room in his house.
He was compelled to sign the contract.
You'd better come see this.
Tom can drive.
"Don't I deserve to be happy, too?"
Tom gets the same salary as I do.
That's only half the story.
Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you.
I should've done this earlier.
I dozed.
I need you and Tom.
That costs 1.5 euros per kilogram.
It wasn't funny.
I'll go the way I'm dressed.
Am I going to need a lawyer?
What did Tom sell?
How old is this TV?
The boy talks like a great scholar.
I'd never hire Tom.
I was concerned.
How many times do I have to tell you to stop calling me that?
I used to be quite handsome.
Tom made fun of Mary.
Have you decided what your Halloween costume will be?
Put the rope in the box.
"Why did you do it, Tom?"
I don't think he has anything to do with the matter.
Is there something you need?
I can't decide if I should do that or not.
I don't think that anybody suspected you weren't really Tom.
Some girls were playing tennis.
How did you do that so fast?
I know you don't know who I am.
I was the only one who didn't know.
I told you Tom was busy.
I couldn't get him by phone.
Tom has asked Mary three times to marry him.
It is cold all year here.
The simplest way is often the best way to solve a problem.
You should have come with us.
Tom puffed on his pipe.
I wish you the same.
That seems suspicious.
Everyone thought that Tom was from Boston.
We're all angry.
I didn't think you even liked Tom.
Tom had a chance to travel to Boston.
Tom won't help you.
Tom read a book while he was waiting for the bus.
"You don't want me to miss my bus, do you?"
We'll have to be careful.
I know you like traveling.
Thank you for the warning.
There are no Canadians here.
Tom doesn't know why I didn't win.
I did what I wanted to do.
When does your next class start?
Can you give us a lift to the station?
This is not fair.
I should've introduced myself.
This could mean war.
I just want you to go away.
Tom wanted to work in a hospital.
It's close.
Everyone loves you.
We like playing in mud.
"As soon as Tom got home, he went right to bed."
I'm a fairly fast swimmer.
I know you're worried about Tom.
Tom would've told me.
"Some people tried to dig the treasure out, but they couldn't."
We're asking you to help us.
We haven't known each other very long.
"There will be live music at the picnic. ""What kind of music?"""
Statistics indicate that our living standards have risen.
You don't have to tell me.
Tom won't win again.
You're the person I've been waiting for.
Where did you learn to do that?
Tom used up all his bullets.
I received a letter from my friend.
Nobody knew you were in Boston.
They're both beautiful.
I feel so lonely.
I don't think Tom knows what he's doing.
Did you guess the end of the story?
Aren't you the group leader?
Have you already told Tom?
Tom gave up too soon.
There's a letter for you.
I'm a member.
Don't be coy.
Do you have homework?
You sound like my father.
Everyone had to learn French.
"Excuse me, but could you show me the way to the station?"
"When I don't have anything to say, I am not embarrassed to be quiet."
I have a violin lesson on Monday.
You'll have to get a permit to visit that factory.
It's actually very simple to do.
Tom and Mary made sandwiches.
I love you anyway.
Tom bought one for himself.
We took a vote.
Honesty is important in a relationship.
What museums would you like to visit?
Tom advised Mary to go to the hospital.
"Which do you prefer, white wine or red wine?"
Tom is traveling around the world.
The match was cancelled due to the heavy rain.
Tom told me that I had to do that.
You look like you're satisfied.
You're going to be famous.
When did you arrive? Did you arrive today?
You are wonderful.
Give Tom another chance.
Don't lie on the damp grass.
I didn't touch anything.
What were her final words?
Do you know who these skis belong to?
I was just talking to your mother.
I play with him.
Tom can't live here anymore.
He did not intend to hurt your feelings.
I wanted to show you this.
Let's go to Boston.
We've just run out of salt and pepper.
He does not like tennis.
Did I frigthen you?
The sand on the beach is very hot.
Tom might've followed Mary.
Why ask me? Wouldn't it be better to do it yourself?
At least we had fun.
I saw a light at the end of the tunnel.
I am so sick.
I wasn't born blind.
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
I'm hungry!
Thank you very much for that.
How are your grades?
I'm always ready.
I didn't have time to write it down.
We tend to forget this fact.
Tom needs your support.
Neither Tom nor Mary has studied French.
I'm always the first to arrive.
We're kind of busy here.
Tom's wallet is almost empty.
There's a white dove on the roof.
The computer's unplugged.
I intend to marry you.
I'll ask Tom if you like.
It doesn't bother me much.
Tom will leave next Monday.
Tom disappeared without a trace.
They're all on vacation.
How that happened is a mystery to me.
I just want to go to bed.
I told Tom to help Mary.
Mary works as a waitress at a restaurant on Park Street.
Go be with Tom.
Did you know Tom had gotten fired?
I have a friend whose father is a teacher.
What do you admire the most about Tom?
It didn't taste good.
Tom is a very influential man.
Tom watched curiously.
Why are people afraid of you?
I can't believe you still trust Tom.
He died five years ago.
Tom is a coach.
"Who do you love more, your mom or your dad?"
Tom turned 13.
Can one of you open the door for me?
Tom and I both have very few friends.
When did you buy this car?
You have to make a choice.
May I bother you for a moment?
Do you have anything else to say to me?
I didn't want Tom to help me with my homework.
They despise you.
What makes it so unique?
We both were tired.
Where were you when I needed your help?
You probably shouldn't tell anybody about that.
A cat was sharpening its claws against a post.
Did you really go there?
I think Tom is a coward.
She spends time with her grandmother every Sunday.
I met an American girl.
I won't tell anyone about this.
So what's your problem?
I'm reminded of an amusing story.
The house is too cold.
I hope Tom and Mary become friends.
This was unexpected.
What could've happened to Tom?
Tom and I were both invited.
I didn't grow up in Boston.
Tom is big and strong.
Why do they come here?
Tom says he had to study French.
I wanted to go home.
I must apologize to you for not writing for so long.
Is it time to leave?
Brush your teeth.
Tom was in a wheelchair.
I'm kind of surprised.
I'll find a way to do that.
Tom couldn't answer the question.
Next year is the year of the rabbit.
"If you see Tom, say hello to him for me."
Tom won't give you your money back.
We've got it.
Tom shouldn't have told Mary his secrets.
He often writes letters to his parents.
I heard about your problems from Tom.
I don't understand what this means at all.
"Let's not talk about money, okay?"
Tom said you needed a job.
I'm going to have a heart attack.
Father is away from home.
I wish I knew where Tom was.
You should be ready for the worst.
Life is very hard.
He is very talented.
Please tell me about your hobbies.
Tom said he liked it a lot.
Do you have any proof?
Tom was shocked to learn that Facebook collected so much information on him.
Tom shot himself.
How old is this tree?
This island has an ideal climate.
Tom seems to be running out of ideas.
Tom asked Mary to tell John what to do.
I'm expecting visitors.
Tom is in good health.
This table is heavy.
What do you think about astrology?
Tom was determined to kill Mary.
That isn't what I'm talking about.
You need to hurry.
How did you get here so quickly?
Did you sign it?
I don't want it now.
Why don't you play the banjo anymore?
You're very wise.
Tom told me he planned to rob a bank.
Who do you think I am?
Turn up the volume.
I won't be back soon.
I am ready to do anything for you.
We packed everything.
Tom shouldn't lie to Mary.
Let's talk about what you did in Boston.
Thanks a lot for the invitation.
Tom asked me why I didn't eat meat.
I was talking about you.
The police seem to know exactly where we are.
Do you think the police will ever find out who stole your car?
I can come back.
Tom's not busy.
I want to teach Tom how to do that.
How many years did it take to build the pyramids?
Tom is trying hard.
Let's not talk about religion.
They were evacuated.
You have lots of phones.
I managed to acquire two tickets for the concert.
You're the first person I told that to.
I'm just joking.
The boy grew up to be a famous scientist.
"Greeks often eat fish, too."
What made Tom leave?
Tom is completely crazy.
I've heard everything.
Did you vote yet?
You can take the bus to the station.
I look forward to meeting you.
He is teaching Spanish to the children.
Clothes make the man.
I'll be back home by 2:30.
She looked as if she had been ill.
Tom died at his home on October 20th.
Tom smiled when Mary winked at him.
I didn't know Tom was going to come.
Tom gave me back my dictionary.
I wonder what made Tom think Mary doesn't have to do that.
Tom's mother lives in Boston. His father lives in Chicago.
I don't think I should tell you.
It's terrible.
I don't think that anything is broken.
He has a fear that his brother will fail.
I’ve always wanted to have a pet squirrel.
I must warn them.
"The immigrants dream of having a new, better life."
I am going to leave tomorrow.
Why are you so mad?
What inspired you to do that?
You said you didn't want to go.
Let's not go.
Tom came home drunk.
I play the piano every day.
Tom started screaming at the top of his lungs.
I think I shouldn't have done that.
I'm putting boots on.
Tom dropped out of the tournament.
Tom rejected the idea.
Tom won't like that.
Be careful when you cross a road.
Does it matter to you?
I argued with Tom.
Did anybody sing with you?
Tom doesn't have to go to school today.
I don't think that that will fly.
"I, too, am not a student."
Tom was held hostage for a whole month.
I like bright colors.
Don't ever come back.
Put this book on top of the others.
There's no harm in trying.
Children go to school to learn things.
I'm looking forward to it.
"Open the window, please."
He's beginning to cry.
Her hair was similar in color to mine.
Tom became a French teacher.
Tom didn't know what to do with the leftover food.
They're a good team.
Tom has already apologized for that.
There's a bit of a wind today.
I'm glad to help you.
I outsmarted Tom.
I don't have time to explain.
Why isn't Tom wearing a name tag?
"As far as I know, Tom is retired."
My parents have kicked me out of the house.
What time will dinner be served?
I have my reasons.
Tom wanted proof.
I'm afraid that I don't share your enthusiasm.
About what time will Tom be back?
What you said made everybody angry.
You'll find a way.
I don't see any relation between the two problems.
I don't like the name Tom.
I didn't know you were nervous.
How long are you going to stay in Boston?
"If you don't have a pen, use a pencil."
I don't want to marry Mary.
Tom didn't know who the girl was.
I want to be with them.
Tom is walking behind Mary.
I've never been to that restaurant.
I had a nightmare.
The girl wearing the yellow dress is Mary.
You'll feel better now.
May I ask you a personal question?
Tom doesn't eat much meat.
I know you know I know.
Tom said you'd ask a lot of questions.
Have you lost weight?
What can they do?
Did you lose?
Tom has already decided he's going to stay.
I don't think that Tom knows whether to do that or not.
Why didn't Tom eat with us?
Which one would you like?
I want us not to get caught.
Tell me what needs to be done.
We have time to spare.
You look pleased.
Tom is Mary's ex-husband.
Only three people were in the room.
Tom didn't want Mary to talk to John.
What I want now is something to eat.
I'm having some problems compiling this software.
Tom asked us to wait here.
Could you tell me how to get to Park Street?
Tom is sitting on a bench in the garden.
I've had enough of your lying.
I'm very sick.
You're violating my civil rights.
We're wasting valuable time here.
Tom didn't bring them.
Tom said you'd come.
You've got to go now.
She got in the taxi.
I've been in Boston since 2013.
Who paid you?
That song was very popular three years ago.
Soon your efforts will be rewarded.
Tom ate.
Any questions?
You can come home.
We have broken off relations with them.
He is wearing glasses.
How many times have you gone there?
Some people take a bath every day and others don't.
I forgot to tell you about Tom.
I've kept the best for last.
I was about to leave for work when the telephone rang.
Tom left me alone.
You will soon come to like this town.
"This is serious, Tom."
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I helped Tom do it.
"You two don't trust each other, do you?"
It is a serious problem.
The economic situation grew worse.
What other choice do we have?
Learn these names by heart.
It was a competition.
Will you have a cup of tea?
"Since you don't believe me, look for yourself."
Our refrigerator isn't working.
I know Tom would never lie to you.
You may take this.
She became aware that her parents were watching her.
Hello!
I wish you could have been there.
Have you ever grown a beard?
Would you like a cup of tea?
I want to study Japan's history at university.
It isn't over yet.
Tom is the star of the show.
This book is so easy that even a child can read it.
Tom has apologized for that.
My father told me about this place.
Go away. I want to be alone.
I went out even though it was raining.
Tom took his boots off.
Please sing together.
I know Tom would never lie to you.
I know that you're coming.
I just did what you told me to do.
I just found them.
I didn't know that you were so old.
I have a cousin who lives in Australia.
Have you decided where we are having lunch?
Tom wasn't moving.
Tom called Mary a taxi.
What kind of women do you like?
There's nothing more to be done.
My socks are wet.
May I use your phone?
Why wasn't I notified?
You're not even sweating.
I knew you wouldn't like doing that.
I leave tomorrow.
"Let me tell you something, Tom."
I'm uncomfortable.
Now I can die happy.
I hope that I don't get sick.
I don't think Tom is still asleep.
Tom will probably regret what he did.
What's happened?
What do you usually do on Sundays?
I don't see your car.
What happened to my furniture?
I hope they're OK.
How can you live like this?
I should've thought of that.
How often do you brush your teeth?
Don't waste your time and money.
Tom already knows about this.
I don't want to speak with you.
I knew Tom had lied to us.
Tom isn't even here.
When did you find out?
She stabbed him in the back.
Your joke is funny no matter how many times I hear it.
Tom couldn't read until he was thirteen.
They dug a grave.
I thought that you liked pancakes.
Tom wanted to dance with Mary all night.
I'm not ready to go home.
Tom's way of talking gets on my nerves.
Tell me what Tom said.
Do you think I should tell Tom everything?
I fell asleep while watching TV.
There was a woman in the passenger seat of Tom's car.
It's a pity that you can't join us.
I'm trying to apologize.
Read the article again.
Who's that girl?
That's what I would do in your place.
I don't know what this means.
Please don't go home.
He is always laughing.
Tom thinks you can swim.
I think you did an excellent job.
When do you have to file your income tax returns?
You won't win.
Do you know how that happened?
Tom only plays the bagpipes when Mary isn't at home.
Are you sure you don't want to come tonight?
Hold the vase in both hands.
Thank you for telling me the truth.
Tom is indebted to Mary.
The problem will resolve itself eventually.
Tom always did the right thing.
I believe Tom is innocent.
It has nothing to do with this.
"If you drive a car like that, you'll end up in the hospital."
I know it isn't Tom's fault.
Tom said he was very sorry.
Is it harder to forgive or to forget?
I need a holiday.
Tom and I have helped Mary.
Tom helped again.
Tom's angry.
She passed the examination.
I can sing well.
Tom flosses his teeth every day.
I read several books last week.
I found it best to say nothing about the matter.
Why did Tom lie to Mary?
These shoes are Tom's.
I'm aware of your problems.
My children help me a lot.
I've told Tom everything I've told you.
I'm happy to hear it.
Everybody but Tom has already eaten.
Why are people scared of us?

I lived in Boston for three years.
The patient is always complaining of a headache.
Tom and I got married last winter.
I set the table.
Please don't shoot.
I've done everything that you've asked me to do.
I wonder who bought the cake.
I want a little money.
We piled the wood in the backyard.
Tom must've died.
You don't seem too worried.
Aren't you going to eat it?
Do you think I should throw this away?
My hands are shaking.
I used to play here.
Tom isn't going.
Where did I put that box?
I thought that you said Tom would do that.

Do you plan to rent a car?
Do we have a choice?
Tom will have to go by himself.
Mary and I became good friends.
I've lost the key to my room.
Tom brought that.
I don't think that it's strange.
I'm tired of living this kind of life.
Are you seriously thinking about going?
I'm thinking of you.
I don't need this.
I'm getting tired of this.
I brought you some ice.
Tom pushed the plug into the socket.

"Tom, I want to have a little talk with you."
Ice cream was Tom's favorite food.
My father goes for a walk every morning.
I have the authority to do this.
I'm looking for my mobile phone.
"She wished for a more relaxing life, but that was impossible under the circumstances."
I broke my glasses.
These are for you.
Tom has already given me what I wanted.
I don't want to know anything about it.
I may try again later.
I suspect Tom knows this already.
Accidents have increased in number.
They hated you.
The noise alarmed the whole town.

Tom didn't help us today.
I don't feel like eating anything.
Tom has been singing that same song all morning.
Tom wants me to follow him.

Tom told Mary about what had happened.
When will you finish your homework?
Are they all like this?
I didn't know that that would happen.
I got very sick.
Not even Tom would be able to help me.
I must have fallen asleep.
I'm not going to argue with you.
How long did you stay in Boston?
You smell like a dog.
There's no urgency.
I've already tried it.
I have everything.
The people were evacuated because of the flood.
You should get more rest.

Tom has written down a list of things we need to do.
He asked a favor of me.
Tom didn't press the button.
Just deal with it.
I told you Tom wouldn't want to go.
Don't worry. I'll come up with something.
I have to admit I'm curious.
You're quite an artist.
Start singing.
I've never felt so hot.

We'll meet at my house.
I drink milk.
Tom stabbed Mary in the neck with his ballpoint pen.
Tom was anxious.
You should thank me.
How many people live here?
How much butter did you buy?
"If I were rich, I'd give you money."
I thought we'd be safe here.
Choose the lesser of two evils.
Where would you like to go?
You may use mine if you want.
It's impossible to predict the future.
Tom told me not to tell lies.
Is there anything that I can do for you?
We usually have breakfast at 7:30.
I'm sure Tom is right.
Tom can swim much better than Mary.
The village I live in is very small.
I might faint.
My grades have improved significantly.
Let's not talk about that.
Tom's life's in danger.
Life is full of confusing things.
I really need a massage.
You're starting to scare me.
What'll you do this weekend?
It's completely normal.
Tom says Mary seldom cries.
Tom doesn't drink.
I like the sound of your voice.

Do you think Tom understands?
Won't you come with me?
Open the drapes.
That's the choice we made.
We'll try this later.
I want to travel with you.
Tom drives a black pick-up truck.
He is not good at putting his thoughts into words.
You know I don't have a car.
I think we've got enough money.
Tom wasn't here then.
Tom fixed the door.
Don't push this button.
I was hoping you could help me.
It's a stupid rule.
Tom is reluctant.
What should we sing?
He wanted to meet you.
See for yourself.
I concentrated on what he was saying.
What did you drink last night?
They need your help.
Tom filled the pool with water.
Why don't you come in?
Why did you choose me?
You're joking!
I've missed you.
That wasn't smart.
Do you have plans for this weekend?
Do you know a good dentist?
Memorize it.

This hat doesn't fit me.
Thank you for your detailed explanation.

You're running a fever.
Is this a challenge?
Did Tom tell you why?
Can't we work this out?
I've decided not to go to Boston until October.
Tom is still teaching French.
We're going to go to the airport.
"Tom will come again, I'm sure."
I don't understand these questions.

I peeled the potatoes.
We do not know her.
Tom's body was cremated.
Give me a call if you need help.

Tom has been waiting for Mary to do that.
Tom is just pulling your leg.
I doubt Tom will be punished.
I know that Tom has already done that.
Tom found a phone in the classroom after everyone else had left.
"If you turn to the left, you will find the church on your right."
Don't mislead me.
I know that better than anybody.
When was the last time you visited Australia?
Tom can sleep in my room.
I'm being accused of doing things I didn't do.
I hope Tom isn't sick.
Nothing is forgiven.
What's your greatest fear?
I must repay my debts.
You're too young to understand.
This book was more interesting that I had expected.
Tom told Mary he taught French.
Tom isn't in a very good mood.
Tom won't admit that he's wrong.
I need to take an exam in January.
Let's wait till he comes back.
I don't believe this.
Do you know the rules?
Tom is still too young to go to school.

Are you for real?

Tom took notes.
I told Tom where we had gone.

Did you say something to me?
Don't you feel cold?
Tom isn't very good at parallel parking.
Tom has a part-time job after school.
We were shocked by what happened.
Tom was trying to help you.
Don't you like this?

Take this to your mother.
You have to be home by nine o'clock.
"If you don't have anything to say, don't say anything."
Tom told me he used to be married.
I've never been so uncomfortable in my entire life.
I promise I'll be there on time.
You can't make me do that.
Tom doesn't yet know what he's going to do.
Tom will be released on October 20th.
I haven't seen her in years.
Nobody considers Tom a cheapskate.

There's something I forgot to say.
Tom used to date an actress.
Why are you not telling the truth?
Tom wanted something in return.
You're three centimeters taller than me.
He heard a noise.
Please don't look at me like that.
I'll miss you.
What effect will that have?
Would you like to go for a walk?
Eleven o'clock is my regular time for going to bed.
Tom will be very hurt.
I'm sorry. I don't have a lot of time.
You should have eaten more fruit.
I asked him if he wanted a watch.
Do you want some?
"If it hadn't been for his help, she might have drowned."
I said yes.
You're on the wrong road.
I seldom go out on weekends.
We'll discuss it later.
I didn't touch Tom.
Tomorrow's no good.
I find it difficult to express my meaning in words.

Do you plan to work until 10:00?
Your method is different from mine.

I must warn him.
Tom still doesn't know the truth.
The letter will be mailed tomorrow.
Are you finished reading the paper?
It's not for you.
Why do you want to learn French?

Why are you in such a bad mood?
I wonder what Tom can do that I can't do.

This was a lot of fun.
You've been missed.
I study Japanese history.
Where do you think we are?
Why are you in such a bad mood?
I think I should talk to Tom myself.
It's time for me to leave.
There wasn't any cat there.
Tom is a legend.
We discussed the problem at length.
You're right.
I thought everyone liked bananas.
It's not done yet.
Tom made it clear that he didn't want surgery.
I love doing this.
Don't come near me. You're filthy.
Are you in much pain?
I knew you wouldn't be busy.
I know that it's hard to believe.
Tom grabbed Mary by the throat and choked her.
He got off the bus.
I knew that this would happen.
Will she come home at five?
Why do you want to go back to Australia?
I'm punctual.
I think Tom needs something.
Retrace your steps and maybe you'll find your keys.
Don't take any chances.
Tom must be hiding something.
Almost everybody does that.

I think Tom is strong.
It just takes time.

You must come home.
I'm calling because I've lost my credit card.
Try to stop me.
Can we go fishing?
I've always wanted to live in a castle.

Do you want to go out tonight?
The restaurant was empty.
Most people don't like hospitals.
"I'm not sure, but I think I know what to do."

Tom bought a bag of apples and he ate a third of them in one day.
Did you read it?
"Tom will be happy to help you, I'm sure."
It was always like that.
How is your work coming along?
I'm glad it worked out.
He was lying on the couch.
He's feeling well.
There's no food left in the house.
I didn't know how to respond.
You've got to give me another chance.
I think we're finished.
I'm much older than you are.
You're not allowed to leave this room.
Tom will make a good doctor.
I wouldn't like that either.
It is said that he has a lot of old coins.
"You must do the work, even if you do not like it."
I'll call you again.
It's about 133 kilometers from London.
Are you acquainted with the man?
Tom is very clumsy.
Was it a joke?
The fact that I said nothing made him angry.
"Tom wanted to leave, but he couldn't."
Tom loaded the van.
How many apples does it take to make three apple pies?
I'm trying to regain my balance.
I know things you don't know.
My mother gets along with my aunt.
Can you tell me the way to the library?
He took off his clothes.
He listened to music in his room.
Why didn't you tell me?
I put a cup of hot tea on your desk.
It's more difficult than you think.
Tom added his name to the list of people who wanted to attend the dance.
Tom often watches horror movies.
Thanks in advance.
These aren't real.
We just want Tom to keep working.
We expected you at 2:30.
Tom was waiting for you.
I know that Tom is a hockey fan.
Tom is hungry.
I think Tom didn't understand you.
"If you studied hard, you would get good marks."
Your pulse has gone up.
Let's go before I change my mind.
Tom will go to Boston tomorrow.
Tom bought a very expensive guitar.
I've never seen a house without a door.
I'm enjoying it.
It is extremely hot and humid in Bali in December.
It's a stupid rule.
I'll be eternally grateful if you do that.
That word is very hard to translate.
I have already finished reading this book.
How many days were you there?
It was a ridiculous question.
Tom isn't waiting for us.
I think that you are right.
What's your favorite horror movie?
Is that what Tom told you?
"That's the problem, isn't it?"
We appreciate everything you have done.
I'm very broad-minded.
I'm going to chop this tree down.
Tom's French is terrible.
Let me show you where to put that.
I assure you they're exactly the same.
"Since I wasn't hungry, I only ordered coffee."
He came to see you yesterday.
I said that I liked Tom.
Please turn the radio up.
I explained what the matter was.
That's a risk we have to take.
It is difficult to put what we said in practice.
Tom was probably born in Australia.
Tom never talks about his family.
I wanted to see you.
Have you fed the horse?
We can't let Tom die.
I wonder why Tom is naked.
Open the gate.
The office was empty.
Tom'll know.
We're on the right floor.
You may do whatever you like.
Which one's yours?
How could you allow this?
I know that Tom likes classical music.
What have you concluded?
I went to the airport to meet my father.
Tom is an honest man.
I don't think that I'd change anything.
I promise I'll pay you back the money I owe you before the end of the month.
I can't remember the last time we did that.
We will soon take off.
That doesn't sound very promising.
Do you want to drink some beer?
Is this your first time in Korea?
"Look at this picture, please."
The design is quite interesting.
The accident was due to the driver's carelessness.
Cars are expensive.
May I use your dictionary?
I was in Boston yesterday.
We've read what you've written.
You are safe here.
Where did you put it?
Do you have a green sweater?
Is it true that Tom lived in Boston for three years?
My phone is ringing.
How long does it last?
The fire consumed the whole house.
"You're not in a hurry, are you?"
You said you didn't want to go.
Please tell me what you want.
I was in shock.
I'm hungry and thirsty.
Let's eat out for a change.
Not all Germans like to drink beer.
I will give you a call tomorrow night.
He'll be here again.
Tom allowed his dog to run free.
I know the reason why.
Tell us everything you know about Tom.
Why do you like it?

The child will be six.
Can you take my dad to the airport?
I want to know exactly what you said to Tom.
Tom said that it didn't take him so long to do that.
I know that Tom is picky.
I don't know whether she will show up.
My comment was deleted.
Tom and Mary started arguing.
I just can't help worrying about you.
What will the neighbors think?
That never happened to me.
I said ignore it.
That would reduce costs.
I have to talk to Tom about what happened.
I don't understand how it happened.
I have my own assistant.
You seem very nervous this morning.
I want many things.
Tom lured us into a trap.
They are disappointed with each other.
I'll tell you exactly what to say.
"Tom asked Mary to stay, but she didn't want to."
Don't forget that Tom still loves you.
I hope you'll be comfortable here.
Tom has to go to the bank.
That patient may die at any time.
I want to know when you're going to start.
"Tom won't be there, will he?"
The brave captain saved his ship.
Her vanity knows no bounds.
You shouldn't smoke.
Tom was no angel.
She seems to be fond of talking about herself.
I thought you hated Australia.
"So, what exactly is your point?"
Did you buy a gun?
I forbid you to smoke.
He was snoring loudly while he slept.
I'm not celebrating.
Your seat is here.
Open your eyes.
I hope that'll change soon.

Our website seems to be getting more popular.
I think Tom is a really nice kid.
Tom seems lost.
What did you do this summer?
We can't prove anything.
Tom said he'd be back soon.
Have another cookie.
It's the ideal place.
Am I hurting you?
Do you really want to know why I didn't do what you asked me to do?
That's fun.
Tom showed us his photo album.
The Shinanogawa river is the longest river in Japan.
I know that I'm crazy.
Tom doesn't want to go.
I think Tom was trying to warn us about something.
Tom never told Mary about it.
Don't blame me for that.
Tom was the one who gave Mary my number.
Who says I'm afraid of you?
I know what you did.
Mary is the girl wearing the yellow dress.
Tom waived his rights.
Of course he lied.
Tom has a rich uncle.
You told me that you'd come.
Is that car yours?
I can't remember where I parked my car.
Tom usually walks his dog on a leash.
Tom wants me to talk to Mary about her behavior.
Do you really think Tom can win?
"I'm sorry, we have no vacancies."
I knew you'd come.
Tom may have left for Boston already.
"It's not what you say that counts, but how you say it."
This is very risky.
My sister usually walks to school.
I'm sure Tom wouldn't let that happen.
I think those are Tom's books.
Hey. I know you.
I can eat insects.
He was shy at first.
Tom attached the string to the kite.
He tried writing a short story.
Tom and Mary got married last week.
Tom is never on hand when I want him.
How exactly did you do it?
Tom pulled out his wallet and took out some money.
Could I drop by your place one of these days?
He promised to sell.
That's what's funny.
Let me do the talking.
Tom knew he couldn't save Mary.
You're too kind.
I think it's perfect.
Will you tell me?
That's fixable.
The princess was beautiful beyond description.
Keep quiet.
Don't you like fish?
I don't think I said any of that.
Tom came about 2:30.
We will respect your wishes.
Tom wanted me to tell you he can't come today.
The weather got cold.
I'd like to stay home tonight.
I persuaded Tom to help me.
I had to work.
Tom often quotes the Bible.
I'm aware of your problem.
Turn around slowly.
I didn't know how unhappy Tom was.
I swear I'll never do that again.
Do you want to win or don't you?
I don't think Tom would mind.
I hope you'll be able to sleep.
I'll find it.
Did she forget her money?
I'm going to sit on the bench over there next to the street lamp.
You know it doesn't matter.
I don't know those men.
I don't want to see your faces.
How much does a first class ticket cost?
Did Tom remember to do what we asked him to do?
I never thought of that.
I live in the house my father built.
It's your home.
We traveled through the south of the France.
I haven't eaten for three days.
What do you hope to find here?
Can you predict the future?
Who do they think it is?
I didn't feel like celebrating.
You don't have to know all the details.
Do you want to see your room?
Maybe it is destiny.
Do you have children of your own?
Neither you nor I are mistaken.
Tom felt a little dizzy.
I have a feeling it's not going to be that easy.
I need some money to buy some food.
"Why aren't you going? ""Because I don't want to."""
I'm a golfer.
Tom can't change anything.
Why do you want to go to Boston?
I thought you had plans.
Let's go by bus.
Why are you so pale?
We already know you did that.
The bus will take you to the center of the city.
Don't pull my sleeve.
"Where were you when your wife disappeared, Tom?"
I'd never allow that.
Can we do it another time?
My brother's in Australia now.
We don't have any more bread.
You won't be the only one there.
The nation ceased to exist.
Tom is dealing with that problem.
We hired Tom.
Could you ask Tom to be quiet?
They're coming back.
Tom was hard to convince.
I told you not to do that.
Nobody'll ever find us here.
"You guys will be there, right?"
I forgot where I put my umbrella.
How much more do we have to suffer?
Tom told me I was wrong.
Tom said that he was sorry.
Didn't you know Tom was Mary's uncle?
He found the door closed.
I thought I was invincible.
Just a moment ...
She left home ten minutes ago.
I'll be here until Monday.
What do you want to give Tom?
Do you always speak French?
This coffee is undrinkable.
I caught the flu.
I'm very sorry for what I've done.
I can't believe your parents let you come here by yourself.
Please tell me what it was.
You will miss the train.
Tom is a distant relative of mine.
This is a problem you have to solve by yourself.
How many years have you lived in Australia?
The power's out.
Permit me to stay.
The street is very narrow.
I'm going to see Tom today.

Look at it again.
I knew Tom wouldn't be surprised.
He said his name was Tom.
Can't you see we're talking?
"If you loan me money, I'll be grateful to you."
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Please write this down.
Tomorrow is a new day.
"The longer I listen to her, the less I like her."

You're not that old.

You've done something wrong.
I will never forget your kindness as long as I live.
Tom saw a bear.
Will it rain today?
I was very tired.
Do you really think Tom will cry?

Tom opened the trunk and took out the spare tire.
It's done.
His French is improving little by little.

I saw fear in his eyes.
How many cars do you have?
I figured you wouldn't want to go there without me.
Don't blow it.
Tom robbed a bank in Boston last week.
Who else do you miss?
Please correct the sentence.

The job is as good as done.
"Tom can drive, can't he?"
Do you think Tom will be back?
How did this window get broken?

I have never come across such a stubborn person.
Is your wife a good cook?
What's wrong with yours?
Don't be shy.
I'd like that very much.
The king got undressed.
Are you saying you can't fix it?
Call me if something happens.
Tom is too picky.
Don't you think I know what people say about me?
When will we start taking lessons?

Are you looking for something in particular?

I know exactly what you mean.
I did as I was told.
Tom enjoyed doing that.
He suddenly stopped.
She is a beautiful woman.
I was scratched by a cat.
She looks like an Indian.
I was picking strawberries in the garden.
These apples are rotten.
That movie is worth seeing.
Please open the door.
It wasn't any bigger than a soccer ball.

I know it's difficult.
You'll be told when you can go.
Tom moved to Australia just three months ago.
"Tom is with Mary now, isn't he?"

Will it be hot tomorrow?
You're way taller than Tom.
She is wrong.

Give us three minutes.
What a cute cat!

There's no way to avoid it.
I have to brush my teeth.

Aren't you going to say anything?
The boy drew a picture on the wall.
"Which would you recommend, spaghetti or pizza?"
Tom helped Mary clean the bathtub.

You ain't seen nothing yet.
That was great.
I thought you needed it.

The cake was crawling with ants.

I think Tom said his last name is Jackson.
All we can do is wait for Tom.
Can you give that to Tom?
We need heroes.
I have no idea who you're talking about.
I don't see any way of stopping Tom from doing that.
We're fine.
I'm just saying you shouldn't trust Tom.
He went to Paris at the end of May.
You could've drowned.
I often visit my relatives.
Try to think of something else.
I'll give you a fair price.
Tom's composition had a lot of mistakes.
I cheated.
Don't ever ask me to do that again.
You should rest.
Wait until dark.
I know your brother.
Why don't you just tell Tom the truth?
I'm about to go out.
You have a wonderful voice.
Have I disappointed you?
They have brown skin and black hair.
What are you following me around for?
I'll pay anything.
The yen is expected to lose value against the dollar.
Tom has trouble fitting in.
Just follow them.
You're going to be very proud of me.
"If your child drinks poison, rush him to the hospital."
I'm sure that won't happen today.
Is that what you wanted to hear?
I can't fire you.
Tom was told to leave.
Don't be afraid to do that.
Aren't you brothers?
I'm wiping the table.
I know that you don't do that anymore.

Tom used to date a girl named Mary.
Tom has told me not to do that.
I just got married.
I have absolutely no intention of ever doing that again.
"To my surprise, he had a beautiful voice."
They're hollow.
What do you know about them?
What are your plans for Christmas?
Tom told me what was happening.
I'll come at 2:30.
It is necessary for you to go and encourage the girl.
Can you deliver it?
There was a large crowd in the park.
I can't hug Tom if he doesn't want to be hugged.
I had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
This tradition is followed in most households.
The power is out.
I won't leave you alone.
Everybody but Tom smiled.
Tom has very white skin.
I haven't seen Tom.
Give Tom the disk.
I'm sorry I ruined your wedding.
Any student can solve this problem.
Tom was captured.
I'll be ready on Monday.
I'll be punished.
I'd like to say a few words by way of apology.
Tom speaks French to some extent.
Tom's strange.
I had a bad feeling.
The teacher caught the student sleeping in class.
He said two or three words and left.
We don't have enough beer.
Tom wasn't talking.
We should be able to help you.
Tom will sue you.
Would you mind leaving us alone?
I hate Tom's guts.
Will you tell me the truth?
We walked to my room.
I'd like to go for a walk.
Why do you work?
Where do you want to go?
We need to keep moving.
The turkey was tender and juicy.
It really works.
We have a lot of work to do yet.

No one is calling you a thief.
Are you really that stupid?
He has one son and two daughters.
Tom leaned forward and whispered something into Mary's ear.
I didn't know that Tom was studying French.
Nobody answered my question.
Do you have a generator?
The strong wind indicates that a storm is coming.
I thought you didn't like them.
Tom left right after breakfast.
All that I know is that Tom is lying.
The prices will remain as they are.
That's a horse of a different colour.
Tom told me he'd never be late again.
Everyone thinks that Tom and I are a couple.
Tom slept a lot longer than I did.
I can't order Tom to do it.
Why didn't you speak?
Tom has no idea what he's doing.
Do you really like that?
Why did you talk to Tom?
I seldom go out on weekends.
I want to help you.
I don't want to tell you the truth.
Do you think Tom has enough money to buy that?
Didn't you see the sign?
Did Tom go alone?
I'm very hungry now.
The scene was quite touching.
Why did you let Tom go to Boston by himself?
I know you're learning French at school.
What aren't you telling me?
Tom is just a little taller than Mary.
Who's going to be next?
Tom wrote about his family.
Tom showed Mary a picture of his children.
"There's nothing to do, so I may as well watch television."
Why would Tom do it?
Tom wasn't able to explain what had happened.
Tom never mentioned it again.
Why didn't you tell me that Tom was here?
I like children. That's why I became a teacher.
I can't believe your parents let you come here by yourself.
Tom loves his parents.
I've seen a lot of him recently.
Tom spends too much time watching TV.
How long have you been waiting?
Please take my advice.
I think it's unreasonable.
Give us everything you have.
"No matter what he says, I'll never believe him again."
I've been called worse.
I don't think it'll rain.
I saw a lot of birds flying toward the south.
Tom is still too young to do that.
It's a pity that I have no ear for music.
Look at the map.
Exactly how does this work?
I'm still talking.
We have freedom.
They're a couple of cowards.
Please water the flowers.
My mother is to meet with my homeroom teacher tomorrow.
None of the money is yours.
I can't call Tom.
No one ever came to see me in the hospital.
Tom very rarely does that alone.
Can you keep an eye on Tom?
I missed my train.
Tom is learning how to drive a car.
Tom works at the school where Mary teaches.
I heard the door slam.
Tom claimed that he didn't know Mary.
"No one loves you, Tom."
He got his neck broken in the accident.
It was difficult to convince him to cancel the trip.
Can you tell me how to fill in this form?
Stranger things have happened.
You have strange tastes.
I don't know that yet.
We haven't been invited yet.
I think you're hiding something.
We're going to miss you a lot.
I love the way you look at me.
We tried to stop Tom.
I just don't understand what happened.
"I'm the type who gets nervous in front of people, so I'm bad at speech making."
We still have so much to learn.
That would be fine.
No kidding?
She insulted him.
Please wait for me outside.
"If it tastes bad, spit it out."
"Tom was murdered on October 20, 2013."
I'd like to ask a favor.
It'll be a difficult decision.
I want to buy a house on Park Street.
You've never been like this before.
I'm glad Tom came back.
I wasn't here this morning.
What're you thinking about?
"If Tom doesn't want to go, he doesn't have to."
He was smiling as if nothing had happened to him.
I can't believe you agreed to this.
I don't think that it's funny.
Tom told me he wants to die.
She told me you were sick.
Tom stopped me from entering the bank.
Do you spend more time with your friends or with your family?
I went shopping with a friend.
"Tom married Mary on October 20, 2013."
Stars twinkled in the sky.
It weighed about 14 kilograms.
I should've warned you.
Why didn't you say something before?
You are going to be OK.
Tom'll remember.
I know Tom better than he knows himself.
"After he heard the news, Tom was in seventh heaven."
Tom is probably already in Boston.
You should stay away from that guy.
I wish I hadn't given Tom any money.
You'll have to ask Tom.
Tom dashed toward the door.
Tom didn't know that that would happen.
I pushed Tom into the water.
"You still sometimes win, don't you?"
"I want to travel this summer, but I don't know where to go."
He returned to Japan after graduating from college.
There was no doubt in my mind that Tom was the one who stole my motorcycle.
I knew Tom was going to cry.
Tom has been deceiving Mary.
"Where were you? ""I was at a friend's house."""
I want to eat something good.
That would be terribly wrong.
I must've forgotten.
Tom asked me how many countries I'd visited.
I'm not sure I'll be able to do that.
I found something I thought I'd lost.
Tom woke up toward the end of the movie.
We'll explain later.
Tom doesn't have a phone.
Tom looks younger than you.
Can I have a cup of tea?
A dog ran about in the garden.
I went to the Jacksons' house.
Tell us why you're here.
I will call on you again.
Why are you in my house?
I answered the questions correctly.
My parents don't like my girlfriend. They think that she's not good enough for me.
Tom left a large fortune to his son.
We want peace.
I can't believe it.
Don't touch what isn't yours.
Tom and Mary played chess.
I knew you wouldn't be fired.
I didn't know you were so ambitious.
I voted for Tom three years ago.
Tom wanted to be a pharmacist.
I'm only too happy to help.
I touched Tom.
"Tom tried, but couldn't do it."
I'm not sure what I want to do.
"I'm sorry, but I think you're mistaken."
I have an interest in Oriental ceramics.
Tom has many bad habits.
Tom told Mary he didn't intend to do that.
Can I come over?
I'm fascinated.
I'll tell Tom you asked about him.
Tom told me he wasn't afraid.
I hate people like you.
It's not quite ready yet.
It's time to go to sleep.
You're observant.
I know I've helped you.
The girls are facing each other.
I thank you for that.
Shut it off.
"Although I didn't like math, I had to study logarithms."
Why are you getting married again?
I'm going to keep singing.
When did you go?
What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
How was the ballet?
The girl tried hard to hold back her tears.
We'll never be able to do that without help.
We'll keep trying.
I'm too busy.
We have a lot of English books in the library.
You've answered my question.
Tom has twice as many books as I do.
They continued working.
I want to get in touch with her.
I have no time left.
We're different.
I need something smaller.
I just followed your instructions.
I won't ever sing that song again.
"Hey, what's this?"
I'm glad you were here.
They're paying rent.
Which one of these boys will you give the book to?
I would like to go with you.
I knew Tom wouldn't help Mary.
I grew up in a small town.
Tom didn't let me answer Mary's question.
That was a big help.
Help me hide this money.
Tom never stays anywhere very long.
We were ambushed.
They both relaxed.
We'll go tomorrow.
Tom wanted to be like Mary.
We never figured out why.
You're driving me nuts.
Do you want to get married?
Tom made coffee for us.
I didn't read any books yesterday.
I suggest you do that today.
I never wanted that.
He has a prejudice against foreigners.
Tom can't use it.
I can do that for you.
Give Tom your seat.
How much cheese did you buy?
Did Tom ask you to do that?
What kinds of meat dishes do you serve?
Tom takes everything too seriously.
I wouldn't think of doing that.
She took off her coat.
That's not something I would joke about.
I'm OK now.
We ran after the thief.
How would you have answered that question?
Tom said Mary was here.
Tom plays volleyball well.
Tom has been behaving like a kindergarten kid.
Tom said he had an alibi.
Just say something.
What's on the table?
Let Tom decide for himself.
There's only one store on the island.
The doctor pulled the paper from his pocket.
The doctor placed a stethoscope on the patient's chest.
I don't sing.
They had several children.
Tom was talking to Mary.
Ask her what she bought.
They never found out the truth.
What's all the commotion?
My dream is to become an artist.
The earthquake caused widespread damage.
You shouldn't believe either of them.
What was in the oven?
This table's surface is smooth.
It was worth it.
Pelicans have large beaks.
I hope no one breaks into my apartment.
Tom wrote a story for the school magazine.
Tom is waiting for us in the car.
We need to clean the house.
Why are you here alone?
You probably think this is stupid.
That's your loss.
I'm learning French on my own.
Why don't you call Tom?
Don't forget to pick me up at 6 o'clock tomorrow.
You have a message.
We need to find out who did this.
Where were you this morning?
I broke a glass.
Wait here till I return.
Tom was worried about Mary.
You must be very proud of your children.
How was your trip?
Tom has to go to work.
It's totally dark outside.
I bought it yesterday.
Tom is finally getting married.
"For all I know, he could be in Paris right now."
I sell clothing online.
I didn't see anybody.
Tom understood that.
The same thing happened on Monday.
You don't need to come in.
Tom didn't know anyone.
Will I be allowed to tell my story?
I haven't told Tom yet.
We all have a lot to learn.
It's the first time I've heard that.
Tom intends to stay in Australia until October 20th.
I never thought I'd find it.
How's Tom going to do it?
I thought you didn't want me to stay.
I'd like two kilos of apples.
How can I help Tom?
My parents won't let me have a dog.
I can't stand kids.
Stop asking questions.
I don't think that I'll be able to fix it.
Tom died on the operating table.
I thought I could trust Tom.
Where do you usually buy eggs?
Tom used to be the fastest swimmer on our team.
I didn't think you were still alive.
What Tom told you isn't true.
Could you tell me what's going on?
I asked Tom to give me a second chance.
He trusted you.
You spend too much money.
You're always right.
Is there an easier way to do this?
Pretend nothing's going on.
She panicked when she heard the news.
What is his nationality?
Tom learned how to play golf while he was living in Australia.
Tom and Mary stopped kissing when John entered the room.
I decided to follow Tom.
Is that normal?
I come from far away.
I plan to go there alone.
It happened that the day was my birthday.
I wonder what made Tom think Mary doesn't need to do that.
Tom has surpassed expectations.
Tom bought a Chinese-Japanese dictionary.
The TV's stopped working.
Are you free this evening?
Have you seen this already?
Did you ask the others?
I will fight.
Tom showed me a picture of his wife.
Have you recovered from the shock?
We won't win.
We're going to make changes.
Do you have a picture of Tom?
Try on both these coats and compare them.
That's how I injured my ankle.
I refuse to sing that song.
I can't wait to go on a vacation.
"If you don't like this, you don't have to eat it."
May I put it here?
The train is late.
"After Tom explained it in French, he said the same thing in English."
I hope that I've done the right thing.
"I told Tom to help Mary, but he didn't."
"If you don't go, I won't go either."
Tom said that he'd wait.
Tom said Mary was tired.
I'm not sure I can afford it.
It's Tom that I want to see.
What do you do in the evenings?
I have little money now.
Tom is the tallest person I know.
Tom is flying to Australia on October 20th.
Where is your friend from?
I'm not sure I'm ready.
Spring has come.
That's not an orange tree.
Continue without me.
He's not in the least interested in what is happening in the world.
I've drunk three cups of coffee already.
Don't swim here.
Tom put on his coat.
I am not sure.
Tom tried a coat on.
Tom is a crane operator.
Is it too salty?
Typhoons are frequent in this region.
I've already considered that idea.
Did Tom confess?
Show me today's paper.
I knew you wouldn't let me down.
Tom was fired on Monday.
Marry me.
I don't want to quarrel with you.
I knew Tom would be back.
Tom and Mary studied together.
Who could resist an offer like that?
Tom is twice as heavy as Mary is.
Have you gone crazy?
Didn't you know there was a Chinese restaurant on Park Street?
Does this building have an elevator?
He avenged his dead father.
Tom got killed in an automobile accident.
Who's your mother-in-law?
You've only a few months left.
I am not acquainted with him.
Let us talk to Tom.
Tom's parents only stayed together for the sake of the children.
I'd prefer not to speak French.
I've learned a lot of things.
Tom usually sleeps with his windows open.
Tom is extremely dangerous.
I dreamed I was water skiing.
I'm glad you didn't do it.
Tom asked for a pen.
Spinach is good for you.
Let me explain.
I wanted you to like me.
Tom lost everything and then started over.
I knew you would understand.
Tom was Mary's stepchild.
I can read between the lines.
I needed you.
You're always dissatisfied with something.
Tom and Mary are bad parents.
They say he's a good doctor.
The wind has abated.
Don't you think we should do something to help?
I don't think this is for you.
It is hard to distinguish you from your brother.
He asked for my permission to use the telephone.
I need that medicine.
I'll leave that up to you.
Did you come here by car?
I've never had a girlfriend.
Tom kissed Mary today.
"Tom is outside, playing."
I'm neither optimistic nor pessimistic.
Tom checked the answering machine for messages.
Things are very different today.
The cat played with the toy mouse.
Do you like French cuisine?
You're the only one who understands me.
Why are you asking me this?
The car ran down the policeman.
That was incredible.
I've missed you so much.
Use your charm.
Tom never admits that he's wrong.
I must do as Tom wishes.
Who do you live with?
"You'll like it, believe me."
Does Tom know my name?
She told me to open the window.
We're in the forest.
The sky has become clear.
I was grateful.
Where exactly does Tom live?
You can't give up.
"Our car is rather old, but so is theirs."
I know you're afraid.
I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
What are we doing wrong?
Tom sorted his laundry.
It's in the closet.
Tom couldn't look me straight in the face.
I'm eating.
Don't hesitate to ask for advice.
We're getting stronger.
I'm used to talking to foreigners.
Don't leave them alone.
Are you still sure?
We started in 2013.
Don't make eye contact.
That was such good a book that I read it three times.
I'm surprised to see you here.
Who did Tom contact?
I didn't think you would come.
I didn't say I liked Tom.
People should do their best.
Tom never was strong.
Tom has never had a good job.
Let's work together on this.
Doing that will be extremely dangerous.
I've only used it once.
It is difficult for me to solve that problem.
I sing at church.
You should have nothing to complain about.
Mom is now in heaven.
I didn't tell Tom.
You're back again.
Tom was evasive.
I can help you.
Tell them what happened.
A lot of people do this.
His life is in danger.
That's incredibly boring.
Did you ask the others?
I promise that I'll protect you.
This is a matter of the utmost importance.
How can you not like horses?
We don't have much in common.
I didn't really feel like going out.
I wish that I hadn't gone to Australia.
Tom and Mary are at the bar drinking.
The library is in the center of the city.
I'd suggest you be more careful.
Who called you?
What's wrong with your phone?
The cat caught the mouse.
I told Tom to take off his shoes.
Tom and Mary are growing further and further apart.
You seem to be in a bad mood today.
Tom was run down by a truck.
Don't let the children fight.
Tom worked as a gardener.
You're not studying hard enough.
They put the blame on me.
It took him five years to write this novel.
What would you do if you were in my place?
Is this some kind of joke?
I'm tired of always listening to the same kind of music.
Why didn't you stop?
Tom is strong.
Tom is fluent in French.
"Grow up, Tom."
I've been studying French since I was thirteen.
Tom hopes that Mary will win.
We often help each other with our homework.
I didn't even notice you.
Tom is a bad father.
I consider Tom one of my closest friends.
I'll be glad to.
I doubt that Tom will do that.
Tom is writing a letter.
How many does he want?
Tom seems to have left already.
Would you be friends with me?
Nobody expected anything from me.
I don't trust men.
Even Tom couldn't blame Mary for everything.
I never would've done that.
We didn't find it.
It's all part of the plan.
Tom wants me to talk to Mary.
Tom thought Mary would be absent.
I want Tom to help me clean the garage.
Please show me how to play this game.
I just wanted to play golf.
You aren't expected to do that.
I saw nothing.
I don't know if Tom has a brother or not.
Please give Tom something to eat.
Do you want coffee or tea?
I have never eaten with chopsticks.
My dream is to travel in a space shuttle.
I found Tom in the garden.
You're polite.
The soldier was decorated for his brave deed.
I quit my job.
I can hardly wait until summer.
Has everybody eaten?
Do you believe Tom is innocent?
Tom believes that the rich deserve to be rich and that the poor deserve to be poor.
They couldn't help us.
Tom advised Mary to take a rest.
I thanked him for what he had done.
I didn't know that you were going to Boston with us.
I need a drink.
Tom and Mary were confused.
Did you ask Tom what was wrong?
You weren't supposed to see that.
Can I see Tom today?
The bus burst into flames.
I keep forgetting her name.
I'm important.
I always have eggs for breakfast.
Tom isn't a very good driver.
I'd like to have my hair trimmed.
Tom bought a new pair of sunglasses.
I am sorry to have kept you waiting so long.
Tom was sure Mary was alive.
Tom was only trying to protect you.
Remember this rule.
Your car is three times as big as this one.
Spring is in the air.
I'll have to confiscate your knife.
What exactly is your point?
You'll remember this for the rest of your life.
"Tom is in his room, counting his money."
"This dictionary is very expensive, but is worth buying."
Monkeys love bananas.
When can you start?
Let's go fishing.
He hesitated before answering.
Do you have a message for me?
It took 22 years to build the Taj Mahal.
Do you think it's necessary to do that?
Don't wake him up.
When's dinner served?
I wish I hadn't told Tom that I'd go to Boston with him.
I kept on walking.
I can't help you today.
Tom asked me the same question.
You don't have much time.
The thief slipped into the house.
What a happy coincidence!
One of Tom's friends told me that.
Are there any more problems we need to deal with today?
Where did you take your shoes off?
Maybe it won't make any difference.
"Tom wanted to go, but he couldn't."
Diet is important.
The policeman signaled him to stop.
My uncle has a deep interest in art.
Tom told me to knock on the door.
I have no desire to argue with you.
"Because of yesterday's heavy snow, the ground is very slippery. As soon as I stepped outside, I slipped and fell on my bottom."
You don't look Japanese.
How did you get your first job?
What do you learn French for?
He drinks a lot of milk every day.
Stay a little longer.
Who else is on the team?
It was understandable.
Don't expect Tom to win.
I hope you found something in the end.
I'm sure Tom didn't even notice you were late.
Do you know what you need to do?
Grandpa fell down the stairs and was seriously injured.
Why don't we ask for Tom's advice?
Tell Tom I won't do that.
My sight isn't as good as it used to be.
We've never tried doing it that way.
The picture was wonderful. You ought to have seen it.
You'll pay for what you did to me.
I ate the cheese.
I've never tried it.
I think Tom killed himself.
I want a pen pal.
This has nothing to do with you.
Tom misses you.
You work for me.
I won't tell you what to do.
I awoke to find myself lying on the floor.
Never have I seen such a beautiful picture.
I saw Tom smile.
Tom lives across the street from Mary.
Tom has probably gone fishing again.
I think she won't come.
Tom played football.
I really wanted to help.
Don't stick your hand out of the window.
No one came yesterday except Tom and Mary.
Only one person knows the answer to this question.
Did you see the sunrise this morning?
Tom is limping now.
Tom didn't answer any of my questions.
He's so stupid.
"She shouted, but nobody heard her."
Tom said Mary threatened him with a knife.
Tom deserves to know the truth.
Say it again.
Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius.
Don't forget to take a camera with you.
I just don't want to marry Tom.
You're so stuck up.
I will not let you pass.
Tom has a very high opinion of you.
I will have to help them.
Tom couldn't help but laugh out loud.
I will always remember you.
Take some aspirin.
They're walking without shoes.
You shouldn't smoke so much.
"If you don't want to do it for Tom, then do it for me."
Tom knows me well.
Is that all you want to say?
You've been told this many times.
It's dirt cheap.
Everything is under control.
Tom is the perfect father.
Tom will never find out about what happened.
How do they know the bear is dead?
"I'm not making myself clear, am I?"
Who are you looking for?
I can't believe Tom's dead.
That's just what I wanted.
You're the only one here who can speak French.
Are you done now?
They were conservative men.
Don't distract me while I am studying.
You're desperate.
Tom has no complaints.
Tom won't go to Boston next week.
I gave Tom a chance.
I think French grammar is difficult.
I guess Tom didn't want to bother you.
I'll never leave.
We stayed overnight in Boston.
I'll try doing that this weekend.
I met her an hour ago.
I was strong.
Does Tom know you can't do that?
It's rainy today.
Tom blew his nose.
I hope you know what this is.
I thought you'd like it.
Tom put on his new shoes.
What time was it when we entered the building?
I want to see my kids.
Have you ever been in love?
What're you saying?
Tom didn't lock the door.
I missed my flight.
Tell Tom he has to get up.
His story was so funny that everyone could not help laughing.
You can never be too careful.
I've remarried.
That's a strange question.
Tom said Mary hardly ever does that.
"Excuse me, do you speak English?"
I didn't do that and Tom didn't either.
You said you'd call.
These questions were written by Tom.
Tell Tom that I don't want to go.
It seems I was wrong about you.
Cats are smarter than you think.
I don't care much for Tom.
I don't want to talk about it now.
Tom gave Mary a rose.
Tom has no problem with that.
Tom flew to Boston yesterday.
I tanned myself on the beach.
May I lie on the sofa?
Tom doesn't believe Mary did that.
Tom held the book in his hand.
You know that I'm married.
I don't want to end up like Tom.
We'd like to speak with you.
You forgot to erase your name.
Tom switched off all the lights.
Did Tom enjoy it?
It worked.
Can we talk about this outside?
There's no need to be that tense.
Do you know who invented the microscope?
"If you see Tom, say hello to him for me."
Why are you giving up so easily?
Tom is very flexible.
What time do you get up every day?
Be careful with Tom.
Have I done everything correctly?
He wants you to come home.
I know a lot of people who can do that.
That was sensible.
Do you think that we'll find her house?
"Open the window, will you?"
He can do both at the same time.
"Hey, what are you doing?"
Have you forgotten about me?
I suggest a different approach.
The two of us are finally alone.
Didn't you know Tom was in Australia last week?
Do you think Tom can find it?
She spends as much money as she earns.
I wonder what Tom thinks about this.
I found them.
How many books a month do you read?
You can't fool me.
Tom told Mary about that.
This used car is for sale.
Tom isn't altogether wrong.
You need to sign your name here.
You can't stay here.
Please don't cut yourself.
Tom's drunk.
Hawaii is a popular tourist resort.
How deep?
Did Tom tell you why he did that?
Don't open your mouth if you are not certain that what you want to say is better than silence.
I gave a speech at Tom's birthday party.
Tom turned the light off.
There is an urgent message for you.
How do you know Tom will be there?
Sorry for the harsh words.
It's almost time to get started.
I know this is weird.
That plan is unacceptable.
Respect your elders.
I hope I haven't offended you.
He has big hands.
He had to clean his room.
"When she was three years old, her father died."
I want to buy a pineapple.
I agree with your proposal.
How many beers did you drink?
You will soon cease to think of her.
We knew it could be serious.
Tom's eyes were open.
What's the joke?
We don't get out much.
Why does Tom care?
Tell me what you think's inside this box.
Try to be there on Monday.
When is the next full moon?
Please don't ask me to do this.
"I used to wear ties, but I don't anymore."
Is this place far from the bank?
People thought that she was dead.
They wouldn't give Tom a visa.
Tom will go with you.
They're immature.
I don't like it here.
Tom isn't used to this kind of hot weather.
Do you have a camera?
I wouldn't miss it for the world.
She spoke in a weak voice.
Let's go and see.
"Tom is still working as a bartender, isn't he?"
I wonder how long Tom will stay in Australia.
I'll say I did it.
I was just going to ask you about that.
Keep children away from the pond.
I have something to ask you.
I will help you when I have finished my work.
Tom said that he'd walk Mary home.
Be very careful with this.
I've been to Australia quite a few times.
Tom and I are in love.
I'm not asking your permission.
Why is Tom hounding me?
Why are you always so early?
She transferred from the bus to the subway.
I don't usually do that.
I always knew that you could do that.
"Newspapers, television, and radio are called the mass media."
Tom lived alone in the woods.
Scroll down to the bottom of the page.
I'm a French teacher.
I told you it was funny.
Stay here a little longer.
Did Tom run?
A portrait of an old man was hanging on the wall.
Why should I believe you?
What's next?
"Deal the cards, Tom."
He told me to speak more slowly.
We don't sell that book.
Tom isn't as bad as you think.
I can't remember the last time I saw Tom.
Will you please lend me a stapler?
Go home.
Tom lost his job.
I sure hope Tom doesn't win.
Tell everybody.
Please remember what I tell you.
Tom and Mary are different.
Keep in touch.
I need to explain that to Tom.
He wanted to come with us.
Tom died some years ago.
Tom and Mary have postponed their wedding.
Tom became suspicious.
Tom didn't answer the phone.
You guys are stupid.
Let me look at you.
I came to wish you good luck.
I hope you can swim.
I'm so glad you said that.
Why don't you ask Tom to go with you?
Do you go to school on foot or by bicycle?
How high is it?
I always study hard.
Do you want to go to prison?
I'd better say goodbye.
I don't want to talk about music.
She has a little bread.
Have you paid the rent?
I have a friend who shaves his head.
Tom saw a large bird.
I don't think Tom will notice.
I'm writing an article for the school newspaper.
You're not obligated to come.
I don't think Tom wants to sing with us.
Can you promise me you won't do that?
Are you threatening me?
It's too high.
Do you have an elevator in your house?
Tom didn't want me to go to Boston with him.
I think that Tom is afraid.
I'm not ready yet.
The sisters are quite unlike.
The Apollo program greatly advanced our knowledge of space.
Tom is going to Boston this winter.
I shouldn't have called.
Have you received the letter?
He has no fear.
I've already told you that several times.
They were going to kill you.
This is the most interesting book I've ever read.
Do you want to know why Tom left?
"To tell you the truth, this is a little too spicy for me."
I assure you this isn't just about money.
I know you're confused.
There are only three girls in the class.
"I'm kind of busy, too."
She had her baggage carried to the airport.
It's an abuse of power.
Tom is coming tomorrow.
He dropped out of college in the first year.
What should I call you?
Why did you want me to leave?
Tom doesn't want to go to kindergarten.
Has Tom said anything?
Don't try to force it.
I joined Tom for lunch.
The whole family was there.
It was difficult.
The captain ordered his men to fire.
Tom has been waiting patiently.
Tom bought some expensive meat to cook for dinner.
Tom wasn't dressed.
I didn't do it for you.

You're such a pig.
I'm out of town next week.
I don't think I'll need an umbrella today.
Don't spoil your appetite.
Tom seems to be in love with Mary.
I don't want you to do anything or say anything.
Here's $5.
You should've stayed in Boston.
Tom realized it was time to go.
I was here first.
How much do I get?
This bamboo is too thin to bear much weight.
The faucet is leaking.
Tom swims almost as well as Mary does.
Most girls think that they are pretty.
You're the only person who hasn't yet made a donation.
These are heavy.
I knew Tom would have enough time.
Are we just friends?
My bicycle is much newer than yours.
What's worrying you?
"If it annoys you so much, file a complaint."
I refused to do that.
Tom went to the parent-teacher meeting.
I must do it now.
Tom promised to do that for Mary.
I'll get some help.
I want to ask you some questions.
His victory made him a hero.
I won't tolerate it.
Tom may have left for Australia.
I did no such thing.
He's a strange character.
I folded all the towels.
What did Tom buy from you?
I'm not ambitious enough.
It doesn't hurt anymore.
Can you deliver that?
Tom snores.
Tom told Mary that John would be at the party.
I've read all of these books.
We aren't married.
Do as I tell you.
I think you know that we have to do that.
Tom told me the road was closed.
I hope you like the job.
It seems to me that she has a tendency to exaggerate.
I have never heard him speak English.
I said I'd wait for you.
"You can do whatever you want to do, of course."
I wasn't scared.
Ask Tom if he speaks French.
Would all the mothers please wait here?
He wants to be more independent.
What makes you so special?
Tom fell asleep on the bus.
I'm only doing this for your own good.
I gave Tom a present.
Tom asked Mary to help him clean his room.
They're going to Boston.
Tom can't keep up with Mary.
When was the last time you checked?
We bought a new washing machine.
I'm going to make some bread.
I think I know as much as you.
The new designs are much better than the old ones.
I can't recall when he moved to Boston.
Tell me what else I should know.
I've never seen Tom so disappointed.
I saw you looking.
Tom barely speaks to me anymore.
He took a coin out of his pocket.
We want you to do that.
A loud noise in the night scared him.
Maybe I should've told you.
I can't understand a single word.
I feel sorry for Tom's family.
Tom thinks Mary would be jealous.
Tom has come up with a few new ideas.
She's in a bad mood.
I've come for Tom.
I bought it on credit.
Why is your French so good?
I don't know how other people do it.
I called Tom and pretended to be you.
I'm in the cellar.
"We're busy, Tom."
Where's the nearest post office?
Nickel is a hard metal with a silvery luster.
Tom wants to know where you hid the key.
Tom baked muffins.
I deserve to know the truth.
I won't be voting for Tom.
Mary stripped off her clothes.
I have a job that pays well.
The only one who knows for sure is Tom.
Tomorrow is my day off.
I got acquainted with the chief executive.
Which tooth hurts?
Have you told anybody else about it?
Are you always this quiet?
Do you have a house?
We stop loving ourselves when no one loves us.
Why don't you answer?
Call me if something happens.
I met him when I was a student.
This is a nice restaurant. Thanks for bringing me here.
Dogs are permitted.
I'm not allowed to tell you.
You'll be asleep by the time your father gets home.
Why did you poison Tom?
Stand up when I am talking to you.
What do you call that?
I took my dog to the vet.
Feed the hamster.
A new year always brings hope.
He is a jealous man.
That coat is too small for you.
He explained the literal meaning of the sentences.
Tell me where you went.
I just want to help Tom.
"You aren't listening, are you?"
Tom really hates Mary.
Tom has an appointment at 2:30.
Tom doesn't like the way Mary talks to his kids.
You heard what I said.
I'm looking for a gift for my wife.
Tom is in the kitchen washing dishes.
Here's some water.
He came to Japan as a child.
I'm up next.
Will you go to Australia next year?
I wonder why Tom is so disappointed.
He is a good man at heart.
It could still happen.
Tom was getting under Mary's skin.
Tom hasn't yet read the report you wrote.
How many ties do you have?
You may be correct.
Tom is a musician.
Who's paying?
This juice would be even better with two ice cubes.
Be merciful.
How many books have you read?
I'm sure Tom is glad that Mary is here.
That toy is made of wood.
Why don't you listen?
Tom and Mary made eye contact.
I think Tom is wrong.
We'll help you find it.
Don't put that on the table.
Tom decided to do both.
Everyone in my family enjoys watching TV.
I'm a bit nervous right now.
Tom never learned French.
I didn't know you were busy.
I'm normal.
I must speak with you alone.
I don't think that Tom is going to win.
My mother worries about everything.
Recently he's become a really nice person.
Tom said Mary lied.
Do you know what'll happen next?
Tom and Mary both know how to swim.
Who taught Tom to drive?
We have to postpone our departure.
I wonder what Tom would think about this.
Tom didn't come to the dance.
Tom unplugged the lamp.
I forgot to tell you something.
You're a very handsome man.
Tom is a castaway.
You'll be safe here.
Say it in French.
I respect my teacher very much.
Tom certainly knows why Mary left town.
Is it a compliment or an insult?
Give me your telephone number.
The judge fined Tom three thousand dollars.
I don't think I've made enough spaghetti for everyone.
This is the same necklace that I lost yesterday.
They thought they were invincible.
Tom died alone in the desert.
My horse is white.
What hat do you like?
I'll discuss the matter with my family.
I was 13 in 2003.
It will be hot tomorrow.
You're always together.
The children are asleep.
Are there any bears around here?
It's like summer outside.
My opinion differs from hers.
I remembered I was late and stepped on the gas.
I need more time to prepare.
Find out what Tom is doing here.
Tom is aggressive.
I wish Tom had stayed in Australia all summer.
I'll take back everything I said.
I'm a coward.
I don't know whether to tell Tom or not.
You don't have to eat it.
She was supposed to call him at 2:30.
Tom wasn't there yet.
Tom asked me who that man was.
We're not safe here.
I was lucky today.
Do you remember the first time I came here?
"Be polite, but firm."
I don't have any details.
It's all your fault.
Tom didn't have an alibi.
I have a cousin who lives in Australia.
Do you know if Tom can swim?
Why did you become a bus driver?
Tom asked Mary if she knew John.
Why don't you want me to tell anyone?
I wonder whether Tom will help us or not.
Write your name and address.
Who did you go with?
You can't handle this alone.
I want the other one.
Tom didn't want to pay that much.
Tom is leaving tomorrow morning.
How far away is Boston?
Let's just be friends.
Write me.
"Generally speaking, the climate in England is mild."
Didn't you know Tom and John were brothers?
I knew Tom wasn't as rich as Mary.
Tom dropped out of the race when he fell off his bike.
I have only one picture of my grandmother.
Cats were sacred animals in ancient Egypt.
Do you need a coat?
Don't let Tom go.
Is your father a teacher?
I'm sure there's a connection.
Those two don't get along.
I hope that I can do it.
I already did that twice today.
Do you think that we'll have a white Christmas this year?
I thought you didn't need anybody.
They need to find an apartment in the city.
I don't think Tom will want to go to Boston with you.
She worships him and the ground he walks on.
Would you like a newspaper or magazine?
"You can't speak English, can you?"
Tom didn't know where to go.
I'd rather help you.
Tom didn't even know I was here.
We didn't complain at all.
You're a brat.
There was a meter of snow after the storm yesterday.
I know what really happened to Tom.
She informed me of her decision.
The ship changed its course.
I want a picture of that dog.
Tom doesn't look sick.
There's nowhere you can hide.
I'm looking for an apartment in the center of town.
I want you to lie down.
Was it worth it?
Is there someone with you?
"You aren't in a hurry, are you?"
Tom was impressed by Mary.
Let's not deceive ourselves.
I often wear a hat.
Are they the people you saw yesterday?
Take a wild guess.
Tell Tom I'll be ready.
I think I impressed Tom.
I don't think that Tom will be able to talk Mary into doing that.
I need a massage.
This place hasn't changed much.
I asked Tom to tell you that I wasn't coming.
I've eaten enough.
I think I did well.
My room's a little messy.
I stopped smoking for the sake of my health.
I asked Tom to explain what he meant.
Will Tom go with us?
We should plant more flowers.
The score was even.
We're all hungry.
Tom has never been to England.
It was the least Tom could do.
My boat ran aground on a sandbar.
Tom looks a bit sick.
Stick another stamp on the envelope.
It was dark green.
Will I see you tonight?
Why are you being so difficult?
Take things a little more seriously.
Tom told Mary to do that more quietly.
This is an entirely new problem.
Don't call anybody.
I could not understand what prevented me from moving.
These ice cubes will melt soon.
I want everybody to go home.
Tom has promised to stay here with you.
I think that Tom is still homesick.
Tom won't let you go.
I'd like to visit Boston in the spring.
I want to eat it.
Tom lost a book.
I dreamed about you.
"If you want quality, pay for it."
"Are you going to go with us, too?"
Tom may have told us the truth.
Tom owes me thirty dollars.
I want you to understand what I'm trying to say.
There's one cup on the table.
That ticket is good until April 29th.
I decided to go swimming.
Tom didn't want to do that either.
You're stronger than Tom is.
"Excuse me, may I have another cup of tea?"
I found this book very interesting.
Don't you hear that?
I hope this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
I'm getting sick and tired of all your complaining.
Give me the spoon.
What kind of music do you usually listen to?
I'm used to the noise.
I politely turned down his offer and hung up.
Tom has no chance of winning the race.
A dog can run faster than a man can.
We have our backs to the wall.
Tom never complains.
Tom should've offered to help Mary.
Tom asked us to sit down.
I knew this day was coming.
I know you don't want to talk about what happened.
Do you know Tom's dog's name?
Call me if you find something.
My mother doesn't like watching TV.
Tom meant to tell Mary about the party.
Stay here and wait for him.
I didn't want milk.
I hope that your dreams come true.
My lawyer is on his way.
It was wonderful.
Cats' eyes are very sensitive to light.
It isn't my place to question Tom's loyalty.
Could we talk for a moment?
Didn't you know there used to be a Chinese restaurant on Park Street?
Last week my grandmother turned 81 years old.
We talked for a long time.
Sit down.
Tom has been a very bad boy.
Turn in your homework.
Tom would be proud of you.
You're always complaining.
Tom has a picture he wants to show Mary.
I borrowed this book from Tom.
Tom couldn't go on the picnic with us today because he had an important business meeting.
Nobody tells the truth anymore.
I'll definitely try to see Tom.
Tom and Mary have several mutual friends.
Those people now had no jobs.
What do you think of this plan?
Please turn off your engine.
Did you know that was going to happen?
You haven't been listening.
He made her a bookshelf.
I soon fell asleep.
It's good to be home.
Tom has a foreign car.
Is that so terrible?
Tom was tense.
Tom was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis.
Now I understand.
I think you know what you should do.
There's so much I want to tell you.
Tom and Mary immediately became friends.
I didn't know Tom would be nervous.
I got distracted and I lost track of time.
You're observant.
Keep singing.
Can you help me?
Tom said that Mary was irritated.
"Seeing me, they suddenly stopped talking."
I'm a human being.
Dry wood burns well.
The building is one hundred meters high.
She poured coffee into the cups on the table.
Mary is a remarkable woman.
I want to know what you know.
Do you want me to get rid of this?
It's good to be in love.
This is the heaviest snowfall we have ever had.
When does the museum close?
I hate this music.
Tom is Mary's twin brother.
Tom should probably spend more time with Mary.
Norwegian is similar to Swedish and Danish.
She was a bit late.
Why do you think that Tom didn't want to do that?
War affects us all.
Tom knocked on Mary's window.
Look at my new car.
Tom is going to Boston for three weeks.
I'm looking for Tom.
How long will this cold weather continue?
What are the minimum requirements?
I thought we were going to your place.
Tom was a bad man.
Did Tom tell you that?
Why were you helping Tom?
Tom needs to know about this.
Wait a moment.
You're probably tired.
Gas is cheap now.
Both drinking and smoking are bad for your health.
Don't buy it.
Tom speaks English with a French accent.
Tom has probably already left.
Didn't you know Tom was in Australia last year?
Tom spent all day on the beach.
Let's not talk about Boston.
We don't live in Boston anymore.
Tom is an active boy.
She works all night.
I have tenure.
The plate is dirty.
I don't think I'll dance with Tom.
You were perfect.
Everything's changing.
Don't even talk to me.
Where are the other survivors?
I can read you like a book.
Did you think about me at all?
I'm glad Tom didn't win.
It's cold and windy outdoors.
I need to be more patient.
Tom said he would do it.
I take that as a compliment.
Nobody has made a decision yet.
Tom had to tell Mary what happened.
Stay in your cars.
"Write an essay on ""Friendship""."
Tom called me at home.
How did you hear the news?
She began to cry in a loud voice.
Tom's real name is John.
I want to do that sometime.
Tom is young and inexperienced.
It's pretty hot today.
Tom has been here since 2013.
It isn't as cold today as it was yesterday.
My house is close to the sea.
Why did you turn me in?
How much honey is left?
Let me ask another question.
Tom speaks French better than me.
I'd like to thank you both.
This is extremely confidential.
I need help solving this problem.
Tom is nuttier than a fruitcake.
I didn't buy any bread.
Will you go to Australia next year?
Do you want them?
I'd never let you do that.
You have many enemies.
I don't think that anybody would do that.
Nobody got up.
Is Tom a good chess player?
Tom was very active.
I hear that you're moving to Australia.
Tom likes to stay at home alone.
We worry about your future.
What would you do with millions of dollars?
Did you know Tom at that time?
Aren't you a bachelor?
I don't sleep that much.
Show me the way.
I just told Tom what time he needs to be here.
"Frankly, I don't like your idea."
Our guests will arrive in a few minutes.
What'll you wear?
You should tell Tom that Mary is planning on staying.
"A long time ago, there was a bridge here."
Don't be afraid to try new things.
"By the time you get there, it will be nearly dark."
I have to go to the station to meet Tom.
Don't think I don't appreciate what you've done.
Tom doesn't believe that Mary is happy.
Don't touch it.
The water is rising.
My kids grew up here.
Tom said that Mary was very drunk.
Help me and I'll help you.
How old is Tom?
I can tell you where to find Tom.
You have to come.
You left me with no choice.
He doesn't want to go to school.
I can't sing.
That's my dad.
The event attracted more than 300 people.
The Jacksons are always home on Mondays.
I sometimes leave early.
I didn't know that you had a dog.
You seem to know a lot about me.
You seem busy.
Tom and Mary become friends right away.
I heard him go out.
Everybody thinks I'm dead.
Is there any doubt?
We don't need it anymore.
Your new dress looks very good on you.
Nobody ever helps me.
I'll be very frank with you.
Does Tom still tell you everything?
Tom knew that he'd be punished.
I didn't know you were joking.
Don't you have school today?
Tom is a lot smarter than me.
Stop for a moment.
What's the matter with you?
Sit at the table.
A storm prevented the plane from taking off.
Tom opened the book.
Tom said that Mary often cries.
This sort of work calls for a lot of patience.
Everyone in my family can play an instrument.
Who is your dance partner?
Are you sure nothing's wrong?
Girls are nothing but trouble.
Please remove your hats.
This water tastes good.
I've never spoken French to Tom.
Tom is getting married on October 20th.
I didn't say it was easy.
I'll be leaving the day after tomorrow.
Tom works for me as my private secretary.
I live here alone.
Why is it important to eat healthy food?
They smell bad.
I was as surprised as you were.
We have to get Tom to a doctor.
Do you write letters?
What did Tom do with the money?
Did you get stuck in traffic?
Did you know that Tom is planning on moving to Boston?
I can't finish this work by 2:30.
I have an idea for a song.
That's encouraging news.
I met Tom at a party.
I know you want to talk to Tom.
Tom was doing well.
I had enough sense to get out of there.
I was frightened.
I wonder why people always want to know the truth.
How many days did it take you to do that?
Tom is unconscious.
I work at a zoo.
The death toll from the hurricane climbed to 200.
Tom didn't know what he wanted to do.
Tom didn't want to go with me.
Three people came.
Have you had breakfast?
Tom sat beside Mary and opened the photo album.
Tom wants someone to love him.
Tom's been looking for you.
How many suitcases did you take with you?
Are you angry?
I have seen enough.
Touch it.
How long does it take from here to your house?
How much jam should I buy?
Tom didn't cry at Mary's funeral.
I'll see to it that it never happens again.
The girl playing the piano is my sister.
Tom told me to call the police.
I really appreciated it.
Follow us.
Tom is lying down in the back seat of his car.
It wasn't premeditated.
You promised me that you would take care of them.
I'm not going to tell Tom.
We must try again.
That would cost a lot of money.
I just wanted to look at you.
Tom got his nose out of joint when he wasn't asked to Mary's party.
The dishes are piling up in the sink.
The tank was empty.
We need you.
The automobile has changed our life.
I lost my wife last year.
I know him better than anybody.
"Sorry, I've got to go."
Tom ate pizza for breakfast.
I hope we find a way to do that.
Tom is respected by everyone.
I couldn't have done it without you. Thank you.
I hope Tom finds happiness in his life.
He admired her.
I stole it from Tom.
I won't betray you.
What difference did it make?
I wasn't too surprised.
Mary wants to be a ballerina.
My father is a proud man.
Half of the apple was rotten.
Did you have lunch with Tom?
I want you to see this.
I brush my teeth with a toothbrush.
The equator divides the globe into two hemispheres.
His house is across the street.
I know I can't be replaced.
"You're back, are you?"
Is this beef or pork?
It now looks as good as new.
Call me if you find it.
Do you always have coffee with your breakfast?
Tom will watch the Super Bowl with Mary.
The wine was excellent.
Was your grandfather a soldier?
Men and women need each other.
It's only three miles to the village.
Lightning precedes thunder.
Maybe Tom's got something to hide.
You're not bad at this.
That's exactly where you're wrong.
I decided not to sign the contract.
Do you know what Tom wants for Christmas?
You stole my idea.
Tom got the lead role.
He often drives his father's car.
Would Tom really eat this?
I'm very fast.
It's rumored Tom will be arrested.
Travel and public speaking are integral parts of Tom's job.
How was Tom killed?
I was in the army.
All my friends like playing videogames.
Tom was supposed to be here yesterday.
Listen to your mother.
Didn't I tell you to close the door?
Tom solved the problem easily.
We are going to leave tomorrow.
What are the animals that you can see in this picture?
Tom told me he was going to the gym.
This is exactly what I want.
When are you coming back home?
How long is the flight?
I kept still and said nothing.
How did you find that out?
Listen and learn.
He asked me to pass him the salt.
Tom was married at the time.
I knew Tom would be late.
He rarely gets angry.
Please wash your hands.
We helped him financially.
This box is heavy.
I've never been to a professional baseball game.
He walked through the forest.
Did you hand in your essay on time?
Tom said that he didn't want me to tell Mary what had happened.
Tom got three presents for his birthday.
I swear I'll stop you.
Let's wait till 2:30.
I know that Tom is almost ready.
I'm afraid to go home.
I have to leave.
We'll hide it.
What time should I pick you up?
You never told me you were a doctor.
I'm going to go wash my hair.
Did Tom say what he wanted?
Start over.
They've never met.
Seven minus two is five.
I don't know who I can trust.
I have to write a letter. Do you have some paper?
"If Tom is the problem, maybe you should get rid of him."
You must get ready.
I want to try something new.
Tom is right and Mary is wrong.
I'm much better now.
She rejected him.
You got it wrong.
Is he asleep?
Can you teach me some French words?
I don't think Tom would like Boston.
Are you still alone?
I don't think you mean that.
You betrayed me.
I didn't know your father had passed away.
Boston is a beautiful city.
Michael Jackson was the most famous singer in the United States.
We have no electricity.
I didn't know Tom needed one.
Tom said that it probably wouldn't rain until evening.
I need to find Tom.
One of us will have to go.
Tom carried Mary's suitcase to her room.
Some animals are active at night.
He is acting on his own behalf.
It's very likely somebody will be waiting for us.
You killed my father.
I decided I wouldn't do that.
"Of course, I'll marry you."
Tom won't stay.
I think Tom is still sleepy.
Tom shot Mary.
Your life's in danger.
I said put it down!
You have a future.
How did you discover that?
I may have to wait a bit longer.
We'll deal with it tomorrow.
Tom moved closer to Mary.
Tom is sure it wasn't an accident.
How good are they?
I know you won't do that.
"Tom's eyes are red, and he looks very tired."
I don't have a dime left.
I also speak French.
Tom seems to want to say something.
My parents died when I was three.
Do you know the reason why two-thirds of the students did not attend the student meeting?
Put this coat on a hanger.
Could you show me how to do that?
Put the book on the table.
Thanks for telling us that.
I won't be quiet.
The policeman is wearing a gas mask.
Tom wrote a poem for Mary.
I stayed at his place yesterday.
Why do you study so hard?
I'd like to cash a travelers' check.
How did you get Tom out of that room?
You're always nagging me.
Did you answer Tom's question?
I'll show you how to properly use it.
Who did Tom bring?
The stolen jewels must be recovered at any cost.
Tom and Mary were both at home.
Just get inside.
What are you doing in here?
I know that you know.
I hear something.
We got ready.
Why aren't you looking for a job?
I spent all day home with Tom.
Who ran?
Tom wanted me to help you.
Can I speak with you?
Tom can't see anything without his glasses.
You'll never guess where I've been all morning.
Nobody thinks you're the one who did it.
Do you have a favorite song?
"Tom, do you have a moment?"
I'm not interested in football.
What do you have for breakfast?
He had no objection.
Tom heard some birds singing.
Should we wait here?
Hang the mirror on the wall.
The party's Monday.
I taught Tom everything he knows.
Tom is very good-natured.
Where did you learn to make pizza?
Tom and Mary didn't know each other until John introduced them.
I just want to ask you a few questions.
What's in front of you?
Do you remember what time you woke up this morning?
Tom and Mary were in love with each other.
Tom asked Mary to wake him up at 2:30.
I know that Tom is a brave man.
Get out of my sight.
It will be snowing tomorrow.
I like apples more than oranges.
Isn't that great?
How many rooms are there on the second floor of your house?
I'm upset.
I made coffee.
Let me eat in peace.
I need to borrow three hundred dollars.
Tom said you were hungry.
I must go.
How long have you been studying Japanese?
Will you make coffee for me?
I'd love to dance with you.
I prefer coffee without sugar.
He showed me the way to the store.
I knew I could count on you.
I knew Tom was a bartender.
The door is half closed.
I don't know how to play this game.
Tom wants to become a plastic surgeon.
What do you like about Tom?
I've known about this for years.
I noticed she was wearing a new hat.
I can't disclose that information yet.
You don't have a clue.
A cat was sitting on the chair.
I have a brother and a sister. My brother lives in Tokyo and my sister lives in Nagano.
Aren't you a policeman?
Tom is almost there.
I'm very poor.
Why did you leave Boston?
This was the most interesting book that she had ever read.
Tom kept on walking.
Don't touch my camera.
"I owe you $1,000."
You are free to go.
I'm sure Tom will forgive you if you explain everything to him.
Am I really sick?
We're the best.
Tom opened the door and I went in.
There are several reasons.
I have something.
When was the last time you had a cold?
The English lesson started at 8:30.
You'll never guess.
Tom wants a banana.
It has to be done.
Tom will be able to do that if you help him.
Tom gave me a key.
It seems like you're in a bad mood this morning.
Can you climb up that tree?
"Tom was waiting for me in front of the station, but I thought he was going to be waiting behind the station."
Would you mind if I asked you some questions?
Tell Tom I'm on my way.
What do you value most in a friendship?
I'm not ready for that.
Did you have a good meal at that restaurant?
Did you see any children in the park?
We should wait here.
What kind of software does Tom usually use?
There's something I want you to do.
I don't want to go to Australia.
The book I bought is on the table.
Tom doesn't listen anymore.
We were eating.
"It's true, isn't it?"
Do you know how to tie a tie?
Close your eyes and picture a log house.
The mirror is very dirty.
Tom said he was dog-tired.
Does anyone here know French?
Why are you trying to help me?
What are you doing in my office?
Tom is the one who puts the children to sleep.
Didn't you know Tom had relatives in Australia?
I don't have enough time to eat lunch today.
"Your name and flight number, please?"
Why didn't you protect me?
Tom is a martial arts expert.
Are you through with your homework?
I didn't mean to hit Tom so hard.
It snowed a lot last year.
Bring your daughter.
Why are you awake?
Don't you know what this is?
I know that I've changed.
I bought him a clock.
Tom insisted on paying the bill.
I felt obligated to help.
I thought Tom was in love with Mary.
They kept singing until a rescue team came.
I went to bed before midnight.
Tom said he wanted to watch a little TV.
There was an attempt on the president's life.
Where are you going in such a hurry?
"Listen, he doesn't know what he's saying."
They hunted deer and foxes.
Tom tried to stay calm.
We don't know where to go.
We didn't have to wait.
Why are you always so aggressive?
Explain yourselves.
I'm not very good with children.
Nobody has seen Tom recently.
Say it again.
Tom doesn't have a ticket.
Tom shot the wolf.
I met her by accident on Third Avenue.
"Who can speak French better, Tom or Mary?"
I can no longer trust you.
Do you have a pass?
My father was never around.
I need a pair of scissors.
Tom died when I was three.
Tom goes to work by car.
Tom asked Mary if she was happy.
Tom said he'd call at 2:30.
I remember it as if it were yesterday.
The dog follows me wherever I go.
I don't have the time to do that.
Tom told everyone that I didn't want to go.
Who can stop us now?
Why doesn't somebody do something?
Tom was late for his own wedding.
Do you agree with Tom?
You used to be so much fun.
Let's go to the movies.
Thanks for pointing out my mistake.
Are there books on the table?
Tom said that Mary was scared.
Tom is on sick leave.
That's just awesome.
"No matter what you say, I'm convinced I'm right."
Wash your hands before meals.
He talked about her illness.
Now turn around.
They're about to start.
I really need a vacation.
He is well known in our country.
It was handcrafted.
Tom won't let me do that.
Are you free tomorrow afternoon?
Why didn't you ask Tom to do that?
I feed my dog once a day.
I didn't think about it.
I know Tom personally.
Will he ever change?
The room was packed with people.
Tom pointed out some problems.
Tom said Mary might win.
"When I opened the door of the refrigerator, an apple fell out."
I know that Tom doesn't know why I can't do that.
Can I have another one?
Ignore them.
Tom and Mary decided to get married.
I know it'll be difficult.
Weather's pretty nice tonight.
Don't you want to know what I was doing?
Tom has known Mary for years.
There is only one bus every two hours.
This is my city now.
It's the perfect number.
I told you not to talk to Tom.
I bought two more just like that one.
I'm going to be a doctor.
Is Tom your friend?
My father neither drinks nor smokes.
Do you think Tom can help you?
The Klan often terrorized blacks.
You need to go.
Everyone was very surprised to discover that the slave girl was in reality a princess.
Tom and Mary don't talk to each other anymore.
Tom said that he'd do it later.
His reply was short and to the point.
He is the very man that I'm looking for.
Tom may not want to do that.
I've been waiting for Tom.
Tell me that you've forgiven me.
I was too drunk to drive.
I can't live without TV.
Tom told me that the heater wasn't working.
Do you know how to play mahjong?
I want you to go to Boston.
I hear you got married again.
I've always wanted a pet.
I don't even know anybody there.
No one knew who he was.
It was very small.
Tom went to a classical music festival.
I told Tom to wait over there.
I go to the museum whenever I get the chance.
I was deeply touched by the story.
Can I pay you tomorrow instead of today?
Wait there for me.
What kind of truck was Tom driving?
It was a wonderful surprise.
They don't want us to see what they're doing.
Could you save me a couple of cookies?
Do you think the situation will improve?
I think I missed my bus.
The prospects aren't very bright.
Tom earns double my salary.
They won't find Tom there.
I was a healthy child.
Tom told me that he was unafraid.
I am thinking of going abroad.
We found a great restaurant.
I won't ask you anything else today.
He knows how to read Chinese.
Can you help Tom and me?
I'm sorry that I didn't reply to you sooner.
I don't think I understand.
What time does the next train to Boston leave?
Tom moaned with pain.
I'm healthy.
The moon is low in the sky.
I couldn't contain myself any longer.
You aren't ready.
What else could you do?
Can't you speak French?
Did you go to office yesterday?
My uncle said that he jogs every morning.
How much time has passed?
What are your plans for Christmas?
I'm getting married this year.
I don't understand what's happening to us.
I'm scared of dogs.
"The lower your self-esteem, the more you tend to focus on negative things."
Tom was a friend of my father's.
It was difficult to keep up the conversation.
Summer is the season I like best.
Why do you want to do this?
Tom patiently listened to Mary.
Tom deserves the prize.
"I don't know about you, but I'd like a drink."
They're both wrong.
"To tell the truth, I don't really like him."
I like Boston.
Tom advised Mary not to drink too much.
I have no intention of getting wet.
The villagers tried to freeze us out.
I'm assigning this work to you.
Tom always thinks he's right.
He cannot stop us.
Tom was surprised by Mary's reaction.
My phone doesn't work.
This is your destiny.
Tom called Mary to see how she was doing.
Tom said he had a knife.
You shouldn't have talked to Tom.
That's something I won't encourage.
I have a feeling Tom is lying.
"Everyone laughed, including Tom."
What'll it cost have this tree cut down?
Elizabeth I became the Queen of England in 1558.
Focus on your breathing.
I know that I'm safe.
You're not very polite.
"Two fried eggs and coffee, please."
I am a bit crazy.
What train is Tom arriving on?
That was a great comment.
I said drop your weapon!
They took Tom away.
Turn right at the next intersection.
I don't understand why you want it.
Tom asked if he was invited.
Anybody can read it.
Did you find it?
I let you catch me.
He advanced his departure by two days.
Get out of the water.
Please buy me that bracelet.
I'm tired of doing this.
Tom is a security guard at the airport.
Will you tell me the way to the station?
Do you like haggling?
I haven't said yes yet.
The sun will soon set.
Do you know when Tom will get back?
Are you still unlucky?
I've never loved anyone as much as I love you.
I have pneumonia.
He admired her.
Tom says he's been asked to give a speech.
Ask Tom not to go there.
Tom probably missed his train.
The guards are watching you.
I forgot my money.
I do like you.
You told me that you were tired.
I knew you'd say that.
He has a sweet voice.
I'm going to Boston next spring.
Tell Tom that I'm too tired to help him.
I winked at Tom.
My favorite tree is the weeping willow.
See you at 2:30.
Didn't you know Tom and Mary were married to each other?
I know you'll do the right thing.
I think I should see a doctor.
You should've called me.
I like people who are not afraid to grow old.
"Tom saw Mary. He saw John, too."
I believe in God.
Why is everybody staring at us?
Tom seems to know who did that.
You have only yourself to blame.
I cannot stop it.
You are wearing your socks inside out.
Would you like to go to the theater this evening?
How often do you come here?
I'm glad Tom is gone.
Tom looked into the room.
I don't agree with your conclusions.
Don't believe anything that Tom says.
My father fell ill because he worked too hard.
You're turning red.
Don't forget to leave a tip.
Who's going to replace Tom?
The boy took off his cap.
You must see this.
Tom thinks Mary won't be worried.
I wasn't even thinking about it.
There is a cookie under the table.
Tom told me what happened here.
I asked him to open the window.
We'll do that together.
I didn't think I'd see Tom again.
Please behave yourself.
Put your books on the desk.
Why not go to Boston?
I've never been a junkie.
You should have knocked before you came in.
All you have to do is to join us.
Do you still want to give me a hug?
I need to talk with you about Tom.
What time will the train arrive in Boston?
I knew you'd come back for me.
What can Tom say?
Many new factories have opened.
I've told you that a hundred times.
Can I borrow yours?
How long have you been away?
I'm tired of standing here waiting.
Why's everybody staring at Tom?
We need to show you something.
What do you think of modern art?
How do you normally do this?
Don't let that dog come near me!
It is time you got married.
I wanted you to be proud of me.
Where did Tom find it?
I don't think that it's odd.
Try to be on time tomorrow.
Tom jumped over the fence.
They have a plan.
Tom is actually younger than Mary.
Tom is going to have a great time.
"If I knew it, I would tell you."
You shouldn't do that anymore.
Tom works the night shift.
I worked hard to succeed.
What's the first thing you're going to do?
Tom says that all the time.
Bring Tom here.
My sister has many friends.
Who told you I'd do that?
What did Tom really mean by that?
So what should I do now?
Tom told me not to do that.
It will not be long before he turns up.
I've never noticed that before.
Tom is in his room now.
How'd you find me?
It was dark.
I have a good crew.
My dog barks all the time.
Excuse me for being dressed like this.
We'll never do that.
Tom doesn't trust me anymore.
We don't need to see it.
Take this medicine.
I'm very happy in Australia.
Tom won't listen to his mother.
I expect to win today's race.
His efforts were in vain.
What do you want to do in Boston?
That sounds too good to be true.
It's happening too fast.
What was it you wanted to ask me?
Tom plays chess very well.
That's my concern.
Pay attention to what's going on.
You have a message.
I don't want my son to be like you.
All of us went to the theater to see a play.
One of us will attend the meeting.
Tom usually drinks coffee.
He knows the secret.
Most of us shouldn't do that.
Don't tell me you forgot.
Mary has her problems.
I don't want Tom to think he has to interpret for me.
Not all of them will go.
Please don't leave without us.
What was it that Tom said?
We used to be neighbors.
Tell us about your brother.
Tell us how you did it.
You can't judge a book by its cover.
Did they talk to each other?
Tom comes from a working-class family.
Didn't you know I could speak French?
Mary is knitting a sweater.
How did you get that information?
Tom has decided not to go Boston next summer.
They are boiling water for tea.
Did you do it yourselves?
You said you'd do anything for me.
You didn't tell me that you were a doctor.
Tom thinks Mary will cry.
I was very puzzled.
Which one do you choose?
She was too shocked to speak.
You are hearing things.
I still have a lot of work to do.
Who else helped you?
How do they manage to find time to do that?
Tom plugged up the hole.
I'll do the same thing you do.
You had your chance and you blew it.
Tom was the one who taught me how to ski.
They all looked at you.
Tom has lived here for a long time.
"You didn't go by yourself, did you?"
I knew that I'd seen you somewhere before.
I can read it.
Who should I believe?
I don't like his hat.
Tom isn't my cousin.
I was able to swim across the river.
Tom owes me a lot of money.
Stop joking around.
You'll get over this.
How long does it take to go from here to the Hilton Hotel?
Quit gambling.
I enjoy chess.
"In Japan, the new school year begins in April."
I'll ask Tom to wait until Mary arrives.
Tom speaks too fast.
Why are you so unhappy?
No one is allowed to go there.
My grandfather will be seventy this year.
He thinks I'm jealous.
It is not a watch.
You should be ashamed.
You're the expert.
He's about the same age as you.
She's busy now and can't speak to you.
What you lack is stamina.
"Since it rained, I did not go."
This isn't gasoline.
Does it please you?
Tom is still too young to drive.
I'd like to go to France one day.
What you told me wasn't true.
I sent the parcel by airmail.
I don't remember you asking me to do that.
I know Tom can win.
I used to do that all the time.
You're a good listener.
Do you like going to work?
Tom doesn't like anyone.
This'll be interesting.
It's interesting to talk to Tom.
I hope that'll happen soon.
Why does Tom think I'm here?
His pace quickened.
Moderate exercise in the evening helps induce sleep.
Why is Tom doing that now?
You look a little tired.
I will take the one that is more expensive.
"If we'd followed Tom's advice, we wouldn't be having this problem now."
Have you written your will?
Was Tom the one who told you to do that?
Lightning can be dangerous.
Tom's yelling.
Please don't argue.
Dynamite was invented by Alfred Nobel in 1857.
I won't go anywhere without you.
He is eager for success.
Please just leave me alone.
Tom hasn't replied to my letter.
I know that Tom and Mary are married.
Its origin remains unknown.
Tom was arrested by the police.
I always wanted to make an around the world trip.
You'll have to discuss that with Tom.
They're family.
I was negligent.
Don't mention rope in the home of a hanged man.
I'm going to teach you some karate.
Why did they search us?
Tom closed his eyes before he kissed Mary.
I need more room.
I was nice to Tom.
He had to pawn his watch.
I want you to do this.
Tom was never late for school.
We're going to Australia for a month.
Tom says Mary is often late.
You need technical knowledge to understand how this system works.
I know you're going to say no.
I wonder whether or not Tom is in Boston.
I missed supper.
I left.
Tom's house is large.
He had his car stolen yesterday.
He gave me a curt answer.
I wanted to thank you for everything you've done for me.
Tom called me out of the blue one day.
I want something to drink.
I just sold the car.
It's a great opportunity.
This joke is not funny.
Tom is the only boy in the class that Mary likes.
It wasn't very fun.
I think that you paid too much for that.
You have to pay in advance.
I think I don't understand you.
I know you stole it.
I think they did it on purpose.
Why did you say no?
I have trouble working with Tom.
Tom was skinny.
Do I need to meet with Tom alone?
We've become like brothers.
We've got to help Tom.
Many people died during the war.
It may hurt.
Tom's father left his family.
Tom won't listen to you.
"I'm sorry, I misunderstood."
Tom was first one to turn in his homework.
A police car just tore past the house.
Does he come here?
He asked me who that man was.
I don't like it when you cry.
Tom's legs are swollen.
Maybe I was wrong.
Are we allowed to use the elevator?
Why's Tom still waiting?
I asked her out on a date.
I'll take them to Tom.
We were all happy.
Let Tom know.
Perhaps I can help you.
"You saw Tom, didn't you?"
You're successful.
They should respect our rights.
We'll never catch Tom.
He plays World of Warcraft.
Both of us can speak French.
Tom says that he can drink a whole bottle of whiskey without getting drunk.
What keeps you up at night?
You must come with me.
An automobile has four wheels.
"In the early days of American history, blacks lived in slavery."
"Tom wanted to make a mix CD of music for Mary, but all he had were DVD blanks."
Tom and Mary hated one another.
Can you prove that?
Here's a sample of the material I want.
We were mistaken.
Tom and Mary are crazy about each other.
You'll need someone to care for you.
The show's about to start.
They kept on walking.
I suspect that Tom has already left Australia.
I'll get you something to eat.
Come closer.
I've only used it once.
I love life.
Don't take everything so seriously.
This is insane.
I've seen you dance.
I'm married now.
The boy talks as if he were a man.
Why don't you tell me why you're really here?
I hope you're staying for dinner.
My watch is five minutes fast.
I was ready to do it.
Tom knew the poem by heart.
How can I get to the airport?
We still don't know.
Are you sure you don't mind?
Measure each angle of the triangle.
I wish I had gone with the others to the game yesterday.
Have you finished reading the book?
Nobody answered the door.
Tom wants his money back.
Can you buy weapons here?
Tom quickly scanned the manuscript.
Tom is wearing sandals.
I need you to understand what really happened to Tom.
I suppose I'd better go.
Is it OK to feed my dog the same thing that I feed my cat?
Maybe I'll call you.
The train was so crowded that I had to stand all the way.
They all drank.
Please wait here until I get back.
We all want to go to Boston.
You're conservative.
Tom really misses Mary.
I know that Tom is replaceable.
What didn't you understand?
I'm tired of studying.
She doesn't live here any more.
I thought Tom was in Australia.
Haven't you washed the dishes yet?
I'm glad that you made it home safely.
What should we eat first?
Nobody goes there anymore.
Stop talking to me about Tom.
Tom didn't blame me.
Everybody's concerned about you.
How old were you when you left Australia?
I know that Tom is a lazy kid.
It's probably a false alarm.
I'd like to stay home tonight.
Tom is waiting for Mary's call.
This is going to take years.
What a beautiful city!
I wouldn't recommend it.
Take Tom's place.
I've already told Tom how much the tickets will cost.
I'll see you on Monday.
"Speak louder, please."
Keep going straight.
Tom and Mary spoke quietly in the corner of the room.
Language can be used in many ways.
Your room isn't very clean.
Are you a golfer?
There's standing room only.
I don't like your dad.
Speaking English isn't easy.
You may use mine if you want.
Have you ever seen Mary without makeup?
Why were you holding his hand?
Tom drives very fast.
I haven't kept any secrets from you.
"Why didn't you come? ""I had no choice."""
How far is it from here to the station?
Do you have any pictures of Tom?
Tom would do anything for you.
He spent the evening reading.
Tom is going to win for sure.
I will probably get up early tomorrow.
Hurry!
We need to stop them.
I've already told Tom what I can't eat.
Exhaust from factories pollutes the air.
I wouldn't repeat that.
Show it to them.
"Tom, I want to hear it from you."
Monday's a holiday.
Tom told me to speak French.
You'd do the same thing if you were me.
Let's see what happens.
Good luck on your exam.
I didn't have anywhere to go.
"I knew that Tom was a good chess player, but I didn't think that he'd be good enough to beat me."
Today we have a lot of food.
This is the hardest question.
We're trying to find an antidote.
We're running out of fresh water.
Tom was fired after being caught playing Tetris at work.
You learn quickly.
I've been told to get out of town.
How did you get that much money?
You'd better not argue with Tom.
Smoking is harmful to your health.
I'm too scared to think.
Do you like to study French?
Can you jump that high?
Tom wants to be a French teacher.
Tom is always arguing with me.
We can't afford to waste any more time.
What's the best way to get over a hangover?
I don't like fish with lots of bones.
What you said surprised me.
Do you really want me to go?
My computer has got to be useful for something.
I think that everyone knows that.
"Why are you angry? ""I'm not angry!"""
How long do you intend to wait?
Many weeds were growing among the flowers.
It's the only way to do that.
I'm sorry that I can't help you today.
We're freshmen.
"Enter your password, please."
He sent me an urgent telegram.
I'll call Tom at 2:30.
This morning I got up an hour earlier than usual.
This will help keep you warm.
Tom is too young to go out by himself at night.
I think this is a big mistake.
Is that your brother?
I always wanted a daughter.
Tom and I haven't discussed that.
May I call you tomorrow?
Aren't you sleepy?
Aren't you supposed to be in Boston?
Tom and Mary laughed.
I'd like you to meet him.
Tom asked me if I knew how to play the clarinet.
"Why are you allowed to do that, but not me?"
Take off your wig.
Don't forget to talk with him tomorrow.
He has rough manners.
Describe your day.
I can't say I wasn't disappointed.
I don't think Tom is still alive.
Your shirt is inside out.
What an ugly dog!
I need a ticket.
Tom ran back into the cave.
Call if you need me.
It was mesmerizing.
I think that Tom will be able to help Mary.
I don't believe you can do it.
I've never seen him really get down to work.
Do you think we should do that?
I woke up early.
Tom put sugar in his coffee.
This year is an important year for me.
I have to buy this medicine.
My list is quite long.
What do you think of that?
I'm first in line.
Do it by yourself.
We respect them.
Tom loaned me that DVD.
That helped.
We had to start somewhere.
You can't substitute money for health.
The car broke down after half an hour's driving.
Tom gave Mary some useful information.
He's in Tokyo.
How much is the fare on the bus?
I think you've mistaken me for someone else.
My plan was adopted by them.
I made a phone call.
How many pies did you bake?
The school is located within five minutes' walk of the station.
Tom dropped out of school when he was thirteen.
Tom told me he was alone.
Would you help me?
I was born here in Boston.
That is a very good idea.
I think you're ready.
I got bored.
I knew how you'd react.
Tom has made a serious mistake.
He explained to me that he had no money.
I couldn't believe it was you.
I planted a peach tree in my garden.
Put it over there.
"Tom couldn't find a job in Boston, so he came back home."
Tom said I looked sick.
Tom doesn't know how to tie his shoelaces.
I found this book interesting.
"Now that you're my girlfriend, I'm happy."
Don't provoke me.
We can do it ourselves.
What's your favorite action movie?
We can't go.
Tom told Mary he knew how to do that.
Deaf people can converse in sign language.
Don't make any dinner plans.
Tom is having coffee now.
Which wine do you like best?
I've already told Tom I'm not going to do that.
Tom is very upset by what happened.
That boy is smart.
I never lied to you.
My father plays the piano and so does my mother.
You don't know what it's like to be poor.
Is everybody OK?
"We're going to need your help, aren't we?"
Tom liked living in Australia.
We've been dating for three months now.
What did you eat last night?
Tom isn't a religious person.
Tom wouldn't believe us.
I don't think this is very funny.
Tom didn't want to move to Boston.
It is almost 12 o'clock.
When did you start having trouble with Tom?
He made no response.
I bought a new guitar today.
We succeeded in finishing the project.
She took a deep breath.
Is something different?
Who do you think's wrong?
He is the best for this project.
Yours was better than mine.
How fast can you do it?
I think you're too old for Tom.
I would do anything for you.
I thought you didn't want to talk to us.
Let's hope Tom is home.
You ought to be ashamed.
There is no excuse for your actions.
They're unemployed.
I couldn't help smiling.
His father is an impostor.
Tom was in Boston last month.
I'm not a very good swimmer.
You're the only person I've told.
The train hasn't arrived yet.
They are both unmarried.
How can you be sure Tom's telling the truth?
Have you read this book yet?
I told you to stay away from me.
Give me your money!
Tom's house is near the park.
Tom won't let Mary go.
Tom said he's depressed.
I'd like you to leave immediately.
I really don't understand what you're saying to me.
Tom used to work with Mary.
That wasn't enough.
There was no need to worry.
It was very cool.
Tom stayed up late last night.
Tom objected.
He reads novels every day.
What does the UNESCO stand for?
Let's speak in French.
I know that's not what you want.
You should get some rest.
I'll give you Tom's address.
"Which do you like better, the sea or the mountains?"
I have the best job in the world.
Are you still dressed?
They'll find me.
Something was wrong with Tom.
Please turn on the television.
We'll win.
Is French taught at your school?
"If you rest, you will be back on your feet again soon."
I came here to tell you something important.
"Who's older, you or Tom?"
Tom broke numerous laws.
Tom died young.
Don't blow your nose like that.
Tell Tom to meet me there.
Tell Tom you're not ready.
Tom tried to hide a smile.
Where is the school?
I fed the dog about an hour ago.
Tom does it faster than me.
I'll accompany you to the hospital.
It is true that he went bankrupt.
I recall less and less of my childhood.
Tom came here today looking to start a fight.
Tom walked over to the door and opened it.
Tom punched Mary repeatedly.

The stars were twinkling in the sky.
"I underestimated you, Tom."
Everyone was late except me.
I'd rather die free than live as a slave.
We have a break from 10:40 to 11:00.
I've never seen Tom laugh.
The virus is starting to mutate.
I'm not worried.
I'd like to eat spaghetti.
Perhaps we can help Tom.
I will return your book on Tuesday if I have finished it.

Butterflies are pretty.
I didn't go.

He came several times.
May I write it in pencil?
I bought a used car.
Was Tom telling the truth?
I never called Tom an idiot.
It may help to look at the problem from another angle.
We couldn't sleep on account of the noise.
I want something sweet to eat.
I'm not going into details.
I don't think that Tom likes to do that.
"If I were you, I wouldn't do it."
I hope no one saw you come in here.

What Tom told us isn't very likely to be true.
I did it all by myself.
May we go home?
I can't stand noisy children.

Drowsy driving kills.
Tom took pictures of all the animals at the zoo.
I'd better call Tom again.

We didn't do it.
Are you finicky?
You should have told me that before.
He asked me if I knew his father.
Where was your father?
Try it and see.
My room faces the garden.
They're discussing the problem.
I have no family.

I'm still not certain.
Do you want to eat this?
I knew Tom would want to sing.
What do I do then?
Please turn to the right.

Do we all have to do that?
Tom has lost 30 pounds.
Do you plan on doing that?
I didn't understand what was happening.
Tom was about to leave when Mary knocked on the door.
There's nothing you can do for Tom.
I'll go and check.
I've never hunted.
What was your question?
Have you thought about it?
I still need to deliver these packages.
She used to work for our company.
Tom knew that Mary wouldn't cry.
He is always punctual.

I'd like to know what happened.
I took Tom's picture.
I can't believe that she did that to me.
Do you need me?
The living room adjoins the dining room.

You should write a song about that.
Tom said he could smell something burning.

You could've invited me.
Did Tom find it?
You aren't thirty.
I think Tom likes you.

You know where to find me if you need me.
I'm still waiting for my money.
I'm worried about it.

I'll be back late tonight.
How wide is this road?
I know you have it.
You are very fortunate that you have such friends.
It often snows here.
I didn't notice that Tom was there.
You'd better let me drive.
Five years is too long to wait.
It probably wouldn't be safe to do that by yourself.
Tom didn't mean to hurt Mary.
I think Tom knows.
Please don't open that window.
What's that boy's name?
Tom doesn't like volleyball very much.
Tom told Mary that he didn't like her sense of humor.
Do you want me to help you do that?
We have work for Tom.
I'm trying very hard.
I know you're cowards.
Perhaps it will rain in the afternoon.
A guy named Tom came to see you.
Please be careful with that.
Don't threaten me. I won't say anything.
She was always finding fault with me.
I'm all set.
Tom arrived a day earlier than we expected.
Give me another one.
I came here to see you.
Tom used to tell me I was beautiful.
"Tom lost so much weight that one of his friends walked straight past him in the street, without recognising him."
Tom's dog attacked me.
Gray hair makes you look older.
Allow me to show you to your room.
Tom and Mary have three children under the age of thirteen.
I have no idea where Tom put his umbrella.
I don't think that I'm the best person for the job.
I'm unmarried.
Tom doesn't want to talk about school.
I've told you the truth.
I think Tom and Mary are married.
You should begin right away.
My car won't start.
Tom told me to answer all your questions.
Don't leave town.
We slept in a tent.
I'm used to the dark.
I know that you've been avoiding me.
I didn't know you were so lazy.
"Wake up, Tom."
I had to leave Boston.
I don't want anyone to know about this.
I didn't know you were hungry.
The girl resembled her mother.
It stopped snowing an hour ago.
Another man has died.
What do you know about cockroaches?
I've talked with Tom about that already.
I recommend Boston.
She makes me happy.
Who does Tom think he is?
I'm not happy about the situation.
I don't work for anyone.
Tom will probably wait.
Go and apologize to Tom.
That's not what I told you.
I won't bother you anymore.
Tom knew I was busy.
Tom didn't speak to me.
I won't ask for help.
He's not serious.
Where did you buy flowers?
Why haven't you done that yet?
Do you think I'm ugly?
There's nothing more important to me than my family.
I play trumpet in the school band.
What's your favorite opera?
Didn't I tell you not to close the door?
I had to have two fillings.
I don't think that Tom cares.
I'll be with you forever.
Tom won a gold medal.
Tom spread the towel out on the ground.
I hate insects of all kinds.
Is there sufficient light?
Look what they're doing.
"Tom doesn't care, but I do."
We're going to fix those things.
I think it's highly unlikely that Tom will go bowling.
I can't believe Tom has children.
I'm surprised you don't agree.
Get on your knees.
You bought an expensive coat.
Why are you always so cynical?
They were so happy together.
I still have a lot of questions I want to ask you.
You're everything to me.
Their relationship is falling apart.
Tom is going to be arrested.
I never imagined we'd be talking about this topic today.
I like the taste of watermelon.
Tom asked me if I liked Mary.
I have a friend whose father is a famous pianist.
Someday we will be able to go on a voyage to Mars.
I didn't find everything I wanted.
Tom said that he didn't want to work here anymore.
I told Tom you were in Boston.
I'll tell you what needs to be done.
My house faces to the south.
You're nothing.
Your blood pressure's low.
I'm sure Tom had nothing to do with this.
How much does it cost to get a haircut nowadays?
We're working on it.
Do you know how that looks?
Tom smoked a cigar.
This is an opera in five acts.
Will Tom go with you?
Tom said Mary was happy.
Tom doesn't know where Mary's umbrella is.
I have some paperwork to do.
Why are we doing all this?
I know your brother very well.
I'm glad to see that you're happy.
Who was that you were just talking to?
Tom lost his reading glasses.
It isn't easy to learn a foreign language.
I went home.
Tom intended to kill himself.
I know you hate your job.
Tom has two options.
How are you two related?
I've already told you that I don't know how to do that.
I remember seeing you before.
Tom and Mary did what they were told.
I met one of my friends on my way home.
Do you want it?
I didn't give Tom any money.
Tell me where you found it.
"You forgot to comb your hair, Tom."
I don't know what I'll do without you.
Tom and Mary make a very nice couple.
I've lost my keys.
Tom tried to pry open the box.
I know you're not serious.
What would you like to eat?
Almost no one lives there.
Is she all right?
Umbrellas sell well.
Tom bought a camera that was made in Japan.
"Out of twenty students, only one has read the book."
Let's look upstairs.
I want to know what I can do.
Neither Tom nor Mary has agreed to help.
Tom came too early because of a misunderstanding.
Tom's mother often left him alone when he was a baby.
I like everything.
I got a lot of pleasure out of seeing Tom.
We need a large amount of coal.
What a splendid idea!
You're supposed to be in Boston.
Let me know if you are in need of anything.
What can you give me?
I asked Tom to stay at home.
Do you have a part time job?
What did you do then?
Tom jumped on his horse.
Tom is too weak to lift himself.
You're all I've got.
You've never talked much about Tom.
You are quite right.
It was an awful accident.
The movie was too long.
You don't need to think about that now.
I've been wanting to see that movie for a long time.
Why did you show it to Tom?
He sat there surrounded by his children.
Maybe Tom didn't see us.
You will be able to see him tomorrow.
What did Tom tell you about us?
I brought you some ice cream.
I swore at Tom.
I stand corrected.
That's what's going to happen.
Don't lose your cool.
Our little boy is growing up.
Tom bought lots of souvenirs.
I'm very glad to hear the news.
You can't go alone.
Why do you want to go back to Boston?
Would you like to sit down?
How much does this book cost?
I knew I needed to do that.
He was conscious of his mistake.
Tom and I were born on the same day.
Tom came a few days later.
I have the same question.
We're never going to get there.
Put the baby to sleep.
I'm inside the bathroom because I'm washing my hands.
Anybody can use it.
Tell me why you think you can't trust me.
Does Tom have a job?
Anybody can do that.
Did you receive the flowers?
It's all very strange.
I'm sure that's being done already.
Please leave everything to us.
I trusted them.
What's taking you so long?
Why don't you take a look at this data?
Did you break it?
I can't ever forgive you for what you did.
The guys all made fun of him.
I don't think Tom knows anybody who is able to do that.
I hope nobody saw you coming in here.
It's easy to understand why people hate Tom.
I like to be alone.
I didn't know Tom was your father.
Just put it on the table.
I left a lot of good friends in Boston.
"He did it not once, but twice."
School starts in September in Europe.
"One way or round trip? ""One way, please."""
Did you study?
You'll have to pay.
I want you to dig a hole.
I wonder where Tom is from.
When was the last time you cleaned your room?
Love is complicated.
Tom always drinks his coffee black with no sugar.
He set fire to his own house.
Tom picked up all the information he could.
Tom mentioned Mary's name twice.
Couldn't you go someplace else?
I was surprised when Tom told me.
It snowed hard yesterday.
The room is very clean.
What an absurd idea!
I told Tom not to do that.
It's our duty to always obey the law.
I don't like this music.
The concert lasted three hours.
Don't read in this room.
Love is never without jealousy.
I didn't expect to see you.
Tom prefers jazz.
I saw him again.
Please tell me how to get to the airport.
He gave three wrong answers.
Did you do the homework by yourself?
I'm afraid I have addressed the parcel wrongly.
We have a single for 50 dollars per night.
Tom now requires around-the-clock care.
I'm not the only one.
I forget his name.
I know who the thief is.
Tom reminds me of my first husband.
I was going to visit a friend.
Tom had a date with Mary.
Tom started to untie his shoes.
I'm not pessimistic.
This is the best book I have ever read.
It's beyond me.
You've been very kind to Tom.
I can't figure out why nobody comes here anymore.
Tokyo is bigger than Yokohama.
Please fix it.
"Yesterday, Tom studied all day."
You're a lot smarter than you think.
I lived in Boston last year.
I often borrow books from Tom.
Three people are absent.
I am about your age.
I hope that the weather stays this way.
Why isn't Tom eating?
Tom's car is stuck in the mud.
I've never been late before.
I don't work today.
My father and sister are carpenters.
Are you afraid of that?
I don't want to hear another word about it!
Tom needs to be more careful.
Tom got a small piece of pie.
I never suggested that.
Tom has to go to school early tomorrow.
I told them all about you.
Please do it.
I can't believe anything Tom says.
He's very stingy.
Tom asked us to wait until Monday.
We're both very proud of you.
Tom's signature is illegible.
The scientists analyzed the data.
Tom is half Mary's age.
I have to change.
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?
Wake me up early tomorrow morning.
Are you just going to stand there all day?
Why are you afraid of me?
Don't be so lazy.
I did that all on my own.
His son disappeared seven years ago.
This is the coffee shop I first met my wife in.
It was interesting.
What impressed you most?
Tom wanted a fresh start.
I knew you wouldn't come.
I have a few friends in Boston.
Here it is.
"Tom is still wearing his wedding ring, even though he's not married anymore."
I plan to never drink again.
I'm not the only one who didn't do that.
Tom doesn't know anything about what happened.
Tom doesn't want to go outside.
I don't think that I can answer that question.
Keep going.
Did you understand what Tom said?
How many miles did you walk yesterday?
Tom told Mary John couldn't swim.
His house is very far from the station.
Answer my question.
Tom likes to sleep late.
I like your new hairstyle.
"If I'd had time to do that, I would've."
Tom's popularity is growing.
Stay with Tom and me.
Sirius is one of the 27 stars on the flag of Brazil.
Tom refused Mary's offer to help.
Don't give me any hints.
I want to visit you.
I tried the shirt on.
Tom gave Mary some good advice.
Where's the toothpaste?
Tom got so angry.
He looks his age.
You look like you did three years ago.
I don't agree.
I asked for a seat in the smoking section.
I don't think that it's my fault.
He lost his sight in the accident.
Tom handed Mary the keys.
Don't shout at me.
I don't think anyone else wants to come.
Do you really want that?
I have no wish to see Tom again.
I'd do anything to protect you.
You can't come in.
Why did you ask Tom to do that?
I told Tom no.
I have a feeling that something horrible is about to happen.
"May I call you tonight? ""Sure."""
I want to change.
Are you and Tom both from Boston?
I won't do it.
Tom told me to come closer.
It reads like a fairy tale.
Tell us what to do.
Why is the train late?
We've got to tell Tom.
I want to eat now.
I love golf.
I like your T-shirt.
I'll give you my car.
The blue lines on the map represent rivers.
I don't owe you an explanation.
I would never say that.
I wonder how many buses can fit into this garage.
What did Tom recommend you do?
Is there anyone who can speak Chinese here?
We're going to help you do that.
I'm never here in the morning.
He loves you as much as I do.
Would you like to travel abroad?
Is this your suitcase?
I want you to come to my wedding.
How nice to be in Hawaii again!
He returned from China.
What you do with them is up to you.
"I just know his name, that's all."
You're young and healthy.
Why did you like it?
I don't like it when people say no to me.
Did you get a good look at the robber?
The whole family was there.
Tom didn't flinch.
You'll soon get accustomed to this cold weather.
I'm here if you need anything.
I doubt Tom can help you.
Go ahead and sing.
I can still see my mother's face.
Tom is always absent.
The next question is for you.
I don't know when Tom got married.
There's something I still don't understand.
Tom asked Mary to teach him how to play the ukulele.
"As a writer, she does not fit into any of the traditional categories."
"Unless it rains, I will go, too."
"After the hurricane, their house was a wreck."
Tom came by bus.
Am I in love?
The students ought to study more.
Tom began drinking heavily after his wife died.
He's very shy. He says he wants to see you.
Can you verify that?
We haven't made a deal yet.
You should've stayed in the car.
Have you put on weight?
I should've stayed with you.
We don't have any drinking water left.
I'll tell you what that means.
How hungry are you?
"If you don't know anything about computers, you're really behind the times."
No one was helping.
I really like that feeling.
Tom wanted to buy that book.
I didn't think that we could help you.
We all hated you.
She loves cats.
Tom says he has a plan.
I saw the old man two or three times a week.
How do you propose doing that?
"It's bad weather, to be sure, but we've seen worse."
Did he fail again?
This is my property.
"You're not listening, are you?"
Is Tom on this ship?
Please talk to Tom.
Tom says he has a stomachache.
I wish I wasn't married.
He has a video.
I've told Tom everything I've told you.
Those peasants badly need land to grow rice.
It's already started.
I apologized.
I don't think that this is Tom's umbrella.
Have you tried talking to Tom about that?
His action frightened us.
I'm fed up with your stories!
Did you have a good trip?
I threw the ball.
This camera was expensive.
Tom told Mary that he thought John would be late.
The concert is about to start.
There's nothing left for me here.
You're wasting my time.
Did anything surprise you?
Would you really do that?
Is anyone else going?
Tom can no longer walk without a cane.
"I want to leave, too."
I'm not a big spender.
I saw an exciting baseball game last Saturday.
Tom told Mary the absolute truth.
I didn't know that you used to live in Boston.
Is Tom still smiling?
I sat on the floor.
I hope Tom doesn't go to Australia.
It's hard to believe that Tom really wants to go to Boston.
When did you go there?
I thought it was funny.
I think Tom could help you.
Please buy me three pens.
She is a singer.
Can you break a five dollar bill?
They are singers.
"Tom is going to go to Boston, I think."
She's an excellent brain surgeon.
She has nothing to do with the matter.
How many children are there?
I meant to ask you.
The earth is covered with forests.
We have no alternatives.
I won't make that mistake again.
I wish I could have spoken French.
A wonderful thing has happened.
Why do we need to find Tom?
What do you know that I don't?
I ran away from home when I was thirteen.
I'm sorry I told you.
Mary seldom uses nail polish.
"I wrote a book, but it wasn't very good."
Do you know where it is?
I think I made a mistake.
Tom shut himself up in his room.
Tom pulled Mary out of the burning car.
I want to live near my parents.
I do not love him anymore.
Any book will do provided it is interesting.
Mary insulted the waiter.
All Tom does all day long is play the guitar.
What makes you think Tom was talking about you?
I still can't believe I did it.
Be a good boy and eat your vegetables.
I don't think that Tom would agree with you.
Tom is a little uptight.
I'm sure that Tom will agree.
Put the money in the bank.
I think they know us.
Both men died instantly.
I refuse to work.
I lost three kilograms.
Tom and I both want to go home.
I'm not drunk. I'm as sober as a judge.
Tom owes Mary 300 dollars.
I'll call Tom and tell him we won't be coming.
How many people have you saved?
I don't know anything about Tom's past.
They're twins.
Tom was crazy.
She usually sleeps for eight hours.
Tom saw his father hit his mother.
That's why I'm here today.
How much French do you know?
We have to acknowledge that.
I count on Tom.
Don't you think it's a little too big?
Didn't you know Tom is afraid of you?
Tom is too nosey.
Tom never forgave himself.
Who's to blame for the accident?
I didn't say I'd do that.
We're going to Boston tomorrow.
You try too hard.
I'll wait in the car.
Many people use cash machines to withdraw money.
You're not going.
I've always wanted to do that.
I was starting to feel dizzy.
I think Tom saw us.
"Sorry, I was busy."
Tom practiced the piano every day when he was in high school.
Tom will need your help.
They're tears of joy.
You probably just have a cold.
Do you know when Tom's birthday is?
Tell Tom to write me.
It won't hurt.
I was thinking about it.
Don't let Tom die.
Let's hope not.
You deserve more.
All of your goldfish are dead.
I don't like the house which he lives in.
I'm glad you came.
I'll pick you up around 2:30.
Please remember to write to Tom.
I'm grateful for your help.
You aren't the only one who has had problems with Tom.
Are you dating Tom?
I thought I told you to do that today.
This cat is as big as that one.
That was only part of the problem.
You are about my age.
"You aren't a spy, are you?"
I'm translating an article.
I decided to stay one more day.
Tom said he didn't have a wife.
You won't believe me.
Tom reached for his glasses.
That's way too much.
They declined Tom's invitation as politely as they could.
Tom told me he'd be ready soon.
I don't think Tom did it.
"If he doesn't come, we won't go."
Tom agrees that's true.
Don't answer any questions.
I tried to help you.
He is the owner of this land.
Tom has been waiting for Mary to come home.
I hate living alone.
He pretended to be sick.
He runs.
Tom's face turned red as a beet.
Where is your wife?
I work at home.
What is the most romantic city in the world?
Can I go to Boston with you?
Tom doesn't have to go to school tomorrow if he doesn't want to.
Tom almost always agrees with Mary.
What do you think I should give Tom for Christmas?
Does he know how she feels about him?
I can't read lips.
Tom wants me to go to Boston with him.
Tom is his own boss.
We watched old movies.
"I'll come, too."
Do you want to have some tea?
I warned Tom.
Tom knows that we believe Mary.
Tom watched a sad movie.
Anything else?
Tom has never asked me for advice.
I'm not your commanding officer.
He is planning to launch his business.
"If you see or hear anything, let me know."
Nothing's happened yet.
Tom will stay here.
The doctor told me to give up smoking.
You never can tell what will happen in the future.
Did Tom steal something again?
Tom is a risk taker.
Our train had already pulled out when we arrived at the station.
What do you have to read?
Do you sell newspapers here?
Tom wouldn't let you down.
Tom's wounded.
Wait!
That won't be easy.
Everybody laughed at Tom.
Why can't we all just live in peace?
Don't you ever get tired?
The dog was dying.
He is busy.
How would you do the job?
Tom asked me to.
I can't untie this knot.
We didn't want to hurt you.
Let me go!
That's enough for now.
Tom was playing the trumpet.
Tom heard a shout.
"You were there, right?"
I'm not so sure.
Aren't you sleepy yet?
Do you live near here?
Do it as you are told.
My father's birthday falls on Sunday this year.
Would you do that for Tom?
Are you in Boston now?
Tom told me he felt better.
When did they leave?
Tom has a different opinion.
We'll leave as soon as you're ready.
Tom said that Mary was afraid.
It was so cold yesterday that I stayed home.
"If not for yourself, then do it for me."
Tom thinks that Mary is still in Australia.
How did you know where to find me?
The weather forecast is not reliable at all.
Tom says he's feeling a lot better today.
It was a sight to see.
I must speak with Tom.
I saw where Tom hid his money.
Come back to Boston.
Whose is it?
I knew you were coming.
A lion is strong.
Just use mine for now.
I was expelled from school.
The police have caught Tom.
I don't like such sports as tennis and golf.
"To our surprise, he was defeated in the match."
I'm glad that you succeeded.
I have to go to work.
I don't remember a thing.
I was eating a sandwich.
I'm running a little late.
Tom has family in the Boston.
Where can I find a shuttle bus?
Is Tom going to help Mary do that?
I've got to go.
I'm afraid your plan won't work.
Tom told Mary he wouldn't win.
I've never dated anyone taller than me.
I didn't know that I'd hurt anybody.
It was a foolish mistake.
Can you move?
The same goes for Tom.
Why didn't you ask me?
"He is French by birth, but he is now a citizen of the USA."
Nobody knows the answer.
Tom is probably still in his room.
That was so funny.
Don't ever give up.
He is not always late.
Frogs are such amazing creatures.
I've already signed the contract.
You're very good.
It's time for you to get up.
I know you can't stop Tom.
Tom fell off the roof and broke three ribs.
You two make quite a team.
Can Tom drive?
Tom said he didn't eat meat anymore.
What were you celebrating?
Tom is now hiding in the mountains.
I'd prefer that you stay home tonight.
In Hungary they speak Hungarian.
I know that Tom lied.
I have the feeling you had something else in mind.
Do you have a back exit?
He married a very pretty girl.
I am homesick.
I thought you'd already left.
Come to my house.
Tom wouldn't do that himself.
An apple sits on the table.
We've decided to adopt a child.
I know Tom will forgive us.
How many cans of beer have you drunk?
You don't have to eat it.
Let's move the bed.
It's raining again.
"OK, I'm ready."
He came late as usual.
Tom won't help you.
I don't owe anybody anything.
This bed is cold.
Tom thought he would be able to do what Mary asked him to do.
Tom hates you.
They did not have good equipment.
He's a little nuts.
You were great.
Tom asked again.
Tom doesn't want to go to school.
I'll ask.
Tom is going to miss his flight.
Tom skied down the mountain.
I have a cold.
Koko is a female gorilla.
Most hotels provide a free shuttle bus to the airport.
I thought that you needed it.
The war has not ended.
Tom just kept reading his book and ignored Mary.
Please don't die!
I didn't ask whether Tom was planning on doing that or not.
How is that your fault?
You aren't thirty.
I've had a slight fever since this morning.
Tom didn't expect Mary to leave so early.
Tom doesn't know any of his neighbors.
Why did you put that there?
I came home by bus.
He and I are cousins.
What are you going to do tonight?
Even Tom couldn't help.
Everyone went crazy.
We're soldiers.
The district is abundant in natural resources.
Let's relax.
I stayed until the end of the concert.
Do you know Tom's parents?
Is anyone else coming?
Where did you work before you started working here?
Cut off the power.
It's been snowing for three straight days.
I don't have time to play games with you.
Who else was at the meeting?
I'm dead if I stay here.
I didn't know that what I was doing was illegal.
Are you good at mathematics?
"Are you sleeping, Tom?"
Would you please air the room while I'm out?
Tom will teach French.
Do you want us to go to Boston with you?
Tom is the one who gave me Mary's phone number.
We've been invited to dinner this evening.
How long do you think it'll take?
Tom spoke only French.
Try to focus.
"I'm sorry, but we're closed."
Tom found an old map.
Did you show those photos to your friends?
"Tom shouted, but no one heard him."
I thought about my family.
I have an urge to buy something.
Let me show you how I do that.
It was just a bad dream.
Have you ever repaired a TV?
Are you for or against my plan?
I have already done that.
Mass production lowers the cost of certain goods.
I have an appointment with my uncle tomorrow.
"Don't do that, please."
"I worked on Sunday, so I had Monday off."
I hope you'll be comfortable here.
Tom apologized to us for being late.
"Of course, you can leave."
I know that we can count on Tom to do that.
Put on some clothes.
Tom sat in the darkness.
Tom is focused.
I know what they said.
Tom is chasing Mary.
What do you like best about Boston?
Can you tell me where you are?
Do you need any help?
What're you doing out here?
Tom used to go fishing with his father.
When was this bridge built?
Suddenly Tom began to cry.
Tom and Mary were also there.
You'll be ready.
It's a matter that concerns all of us.
I can't stand this anymore.
Don't be afraid to experiment.
I don't think that I'll dance.
Do you hear the birds singing?
There is no need for a comma in this sentence.
I lost my phone.
Tom is finishing his work.
I thought you'd be much fatter.
Tom turned out the lights.
I just woke up.
Tom and Mary were talking in French.
Tom would like to know the reason.
I sure hope that Tom doesn't let us down.
I have a key.
We could go skating if you like.
We talked late into the night.
It actually isn't that simple.
I let you catch me.
Are you sure you haven't forgotten anything?
Tom fixed everything.
Tom said that he liked that book.
I don't want to tell Tom that I've been to Australia.
I promise I won't be late.

Tom usually gets up at 6:30.
Don't worry. These things happen.

What do you like?
Tom has got a problem.
What do we know about them?
I'm in Australia this week.
I think we'll be safe here.
Tom gave Mary the key.
We used to spend hours there.
The stamp came off.
Set the alarm clock for seven o'clock.
I'm not sure it's a good idea.
I'm ready now.
You're young and healthy.
I don't know who it is.
Are you going to sell Tom your bicycle?
"Tom called Mary to apologize to her, but she hung up on him."
Let's vote.
Tom saw dirty footprints on the white carpet.
I don't think he is right.
My dad is stronger than your dad.
Tom borrowed mine.
My book is here.
It makes no difference whether you go or not.
We are here.
Let's leave it up to Tom.
I've heard that it's dangerous to be walking alone on Park Street after dark.
Follow us.
Money does not always bring happiness.
Give me one minute.
I kept my word.
That was a dumb decision.
I understand now what you were trying to tell me.
I've never loved you.
This one's yours.
We're parents.
Tom said that wasn't enough.
I am a dog person.
Tom had some great ideas.

You can borrow an umbrella if you need one.
I'm coming.
Tom and Mary looked at each other and then at John.
I thought we should go.
My bicycle has a flat tire.
You gave it to me.
I think Tom has done that already.
I can do it by myself.
They always complain.
I bought a house with the money that I inherited from my grandfather.
We sat down face to face.
Who speaks French well?
Can I go to Boston with you?
What a beautiful picture!
Who are these flowers for?
I've always hated this place.
The storm abated.
Tom locked all the doors.
Has Tom done something wrong?
I cannot tolerate naughty children.
Tom told me not to tell Mary about what happened.
I'm so embarrassed.
Please don't tell Tom anything.
Nobody wants to help you.
I'd never permit you to do that.
I missed school for six days.
He is very proud of his skill as a pilot.
What's Tom doing now?

I used to have to do that for Tom.

That movie is suitable for people of all ages.
Nothing appears to be missing.
That was a conscious decision.
I'll sleep here.
Do you put sugar in your tea?
Tom is good at almost everything.
She turned pale with fear.
I'd like to believe that's true.
The heat withered the flowers.
You've got a bus to catch.
Let's wait for Tom to arrive.
Tom talked with Mary yesterday.
I wish I had bought a ticket for the concert.
How would you help Tom?
The table is green.
This is an incredible result.
Nothing grew there besides wild lavender.
Tom held his breath.
Do you want me to wait?
I'd like to give you a piece of advice.
I wouldn't let you do that.
I like my new job.
I made so many mistakes.
I studied English for four years with a native speaker.
I'll go and call the doctor.
Tom's children are wonderful.
That is insane.
Tom isn't mad at Mary.
I'm going to keep studying French.
Tom didn't know anything about what was happening.
They installed a vending machine at work.
Tom's patience has run out.
When was it built?
I'm sure they're talking about us.
"She seems timid, but she's actually a strong-willed person."
Tom didn't pay his taxes on time.
They like apples.
The key was left in the room.
Did you find Tom or not?
I'd say Tom is jealous.
They say they can't compete with low-priced foreign products.
Tom asked Mary what kind of movies she liked.
Please leave the room.
He is the dumbest kid in the class.
I went to high school with Tom.
I went to the shop.
"Tom and Mary went on a cruise near Italy for their honeymoon, but the ship sank and Tom was drowned in his cabin."
That's not why I came here.
No one is to leave without permission.
How many times do you wash your hands every day?
Tom wanted something cold to drink.
I understand you were the last one to see Tom.
Don't think about it. Do it.
Tom accepted Mary's invitation.
They never apologized.
This stain won't come out.
"When Mary went to cook dinner, she found that her potatoes had sprouted in the cupboard."
Do you have a shovel I can borrow?
Tom needs to be found.
I haven't read this book yet.
I decided to go there.
Why does everyone think that I'm stupid?
Tom has skinny legs.
"What! This T-shirt is 3,000 yen? This is a rip-off!"
I get up at 6:30.
He's not sure he's ready.
Can you translate it?
We need to impress Tom.
Have you been waiting for me?
"That team has little, if any, chance of winning."
Why didn't you tell me?
Tom and the others left early.
Let's ask Tom why he was late.
Thank you for sending me a nice card.
I was at home yesterday.
Tom said he was afraid of snakes.
I know your son.
I need it immediately.
He was warned several times.
I think you know where we need to go.
I want to say thank you to Tom.
The administration of a new drug curbed the epidemic.

I heard every word you said.
We haven't known each other very long.

Do you know anything about Tom's childhood?
Tom is a Christian.
Tom likes to run.
She talks as if she knew everything.
I'm afraid I'll be stuck in this place forever.
Tom was declared guilty.
I'm sure Tom will forgive you.
"That's your signature, isn't it?"
I'm not feeling very well.
This is the best restaurant in the city.
That's approximately the same thing.
We can all dream.
I only plan to do what I have to do.
I just got back to Boston.
Tom told me he would be at tomorrow's meeting.
She wrote down something in her notebook.
We have failed.
Tom showed his stamp collection to Mary.
He smoked a cigar after lunch.
Tom might not want to see Mary.
What was Tom's reaction?
I'm not buying your story.
You need to cut your toenails.
You should be proud of what you've accomplished.
I think you know what I'm talking about.
I doubt Tom intentionally did that.
What can that mean?
Do you want another one of these?
How long ago did you start studying French?
I'm not very handsome.
"Let's go, Tom."
I told Tom I wasn't interested in discussing my problems with him.
Do you know those children?
The station is located between these two towns.
We are subject to the laws of nature.
I love to dance.
I feel certain of it.
What is missing?
Tom is the best.
Tom is rarely in a good mood.
Can you tell us about yourself?
They're going to kill us.
I never would've allowed that.
Tom only wants one cup of tea.
Tom may be waiting for us now.
We walked as far as the park.
Give me back my wallet.
Air is a mixture of several gases.
Tom said that you were busy.
"If you're tired, rest."
We're still alive.
I'll do as you advise.
"If you can see your breath when you exhale, you know it's cold."
I don't know what I'll do tomorrow.
Mary keeps her best dishes in that cabinet.
Tom just ate.
Buy six meters of that cloth.
I want to know why you were absent yesterday.
How was the universe formed?
It was sunny and warm.
It's time to feed the dog.
Tom knew that I was drunk.
Tom was wrong.
Tom thinks that he's better at French than he really is.
Tom was the only one who smiled.
You and I both know that that's not going to happen.
He is a big eater.
Tom has a new bicycle.
Instant noodles are a staple among college students.
There's a stain on the tablecloth.
Tom was caught stealing apples.
Call them this evening.

How's your brother?
I don't doubt that Tom will do that.
I met Tom at a party.
That store went bankrupt.
Haven't you had your dinner?
I bought him a clock.
I know what you're trying to tell me.
Will you help us?
Put it in the freezer.
I'm not working today.
Tom said that he'd be early.
It's quarter to eight now.
Don't ever do that to me again.
What do you want to tell me?
We made some stupid mistakes.
Tom is just trying to help you.
Tom and Mary are getting married in October.
Tom found the necklace Mary had lost.
All Tom really wanted was glass of water.
You're not just my wife. You're my best friend.
Tom said he was the only one who knew how to do that.
Tom agrees with Mary.
"I'm sorry, I don't speak French."
What makes you think that's what caused the fire?
Call me.
You're not answering my question.
Someone has stolen Tom's guitar.
They can't do anything else.
You were the one that told me not to do that.
How much is the express?
Tom has no criminal record.
Why can't I go to the party?
I missed you guys so much!
I can't promise anything.
How tall is she?
What is she like?
Why don't you let me decide?
What do you like about it?
She advised him not to go out by himself at night.
"You all remember Tom, don't you?"
Tom said that he didn't think that it was worth the risk.
I want you to listen to me very carefully.
You said that to me last week.
Why did you get involved?
Tom is the only one who noticed.
Do you see a star?
There are monsters everywhere.
What are you going to do in Boston?
How did Tom get so dirty?
Has Tom finished the book yet?
Please stay inside.

Are you good at ice skating?
Tom told me to open the window.
Tom bought it for Mary.
Tom will lend you money if you ask him to.
When was the last time you danced?
He asked her some questions.
Their eyes met.
I have to agree with you on this.
Who did you give my phone number to?
Tom could never do what you are asking him to do.
Tom said that he liked it here.
I should be with you.
She has attractive eyes.
I have lost my camera.
Maybe you did that the wrong way.
He gave me tea without sugar.
I forgot his address.
Tom realized that Mary was tired.
Everybody knows that you're lying.
Tom called Mary up.
Tom can do that without your help.
We're working together.
Some of them have committed suicide.
I tried to put an end to the quarrel.
At what time did he leave?
I hit the target.
We're never giving up hope.
I'll give you money.
Tom is a dummy.
Security was increased in the city.
I knew you wouldn't sing with Tom.
"You're from Boston, aren't you?"
"Speak slower, please."
Why are you going there?

Tom wanted to play tennis with Mary.
You need to wait a little longer.

I was born the year the war ended.
Tom spilled the milk.
Tom saw Mary's letter on the desk.
I offered Tom a beer.
He and I are almost the same height.
I write poems.
Birds lay eggs.
I thought you were in Boston.
That seems to be the problem.
Tom will be able to drive a car soon.
Tom abandoned his wife and children.
Don't buy me any more presents.
I don't understand what he wants me to do.
Tom had something else on his mind.
Where's my son?
He was not feeling well.
He lives above me.
How did Tom know Mary wouldn't do that?
Didn't you know Tom passed away about three years ago?
My phone is about to die.
I didn't shout at Tom.
Tom joined the army.
Do you really believe those stories?
Tom said he didn't want to dance.
Tom isn't really Canadian.
I told Tom not to call.
I'm glad to hear you say that.
I don't think that I'm very petty.
Tom has a brilliant future.
Tom didn't smile.
I knew what I had to do.
Tom asked Mary to buy him a ticket.
I work very hard.
I was watching you.
The orchestra is drowning out the singer's voice.
I haven't gone to the movies since I got here.
I still love him.
I sure hope you do that.
I've never seen such a large whale.
I didn't expect you to turn up here.
Tom's leaving.
We were avoiding Tom.
Tom didn't stop Mary.
I know where Tom was born.
I didn't know Tom had decided to quit his job.
I betrayed you.
Tom has nothing to apologize for.
Both boys were rescued.
I should probably apologize to Tom.
They're both right.
What do you think I should've done?
Where's the shopping center?
She talks to him as if he were a child.
Tom said that he'd be there.
Tom says he won't go there anymore.
Look at the girls.
Nobody does it better than Tom.
"If you have any interesting books, lend me some."
I can't open this jar.
She failed to understand a single word.
That's a tough question.
Tom left in a rush.
Both boys have autism.
I wonder why no one tells the truth.
Is this what you want me to do?
I don't like your coming late every day.
Everyone was surprised.
It's for my family.
Do you have any daughters?
The only job Tom has ever had is the one he has now.
I want to eat this.
I'm safe.
I am no longer tired.
"You might find Tom in the library, but I doubt it."
I remember that vividly.
Tom talked Mary into helping him.
"If I were Tom, I'd sue them."
He is known to everybody as a great ballplayer.
Your services are no longer required.
"My wife usually doesn't drink coffee at night, and neither do I."
Tom swam in the pool.
I thought that Tom was dead.
I love you like a son.
Tom made only three mistakes.
Tom said he'd buy that for you.
Luck is blind.
What should I do if Tom comes?
I have no siblings.
Go get coffee.
Be careful not to underestimate the problem.
I told you Tom was crazy.
Can you pick up Tom?
Tell them what I told you.
Tom put on a pair of latex gloves.
Tom didn't know Hawaii was part of the United States.
I spent the whole day in cleaning my room.
You can't go now.
It would've been better if you hadn't gone there.
Were you hurt?
She didn't need to come.
Are these children yours?
Tom said I should talk to you.
Tom didn't know that Mary had decided to quit her job.
We should take off our shoes before entering the house.
Tom looked tired.
Tom is often the first one to arrive.
You have to study hard to catch up with your class.
I didn't think that we were ready.
Tom has already started dating somebody else.
Take a look around.
"First it thundered, and then it started to rain."
Go find out.
I want this television.
Tom is waiting in the hallway.
You should trust me.
He was the only one who came to the party.
Where's the zoo located?
Has something changed?
I don't know why Tom is absent.
Are you armed?
I'm really proud of Tom.
I'm sure Tom won't let us down.
I will need your help.
What else could happen?
What did you think we were talking about?
What did you buy from Tom?
Mary's dress is too short.
Today is not so cold.
I thought Tom and Mary had a relationship.
"There are 187,888 lakes in Finland."
We'll try not to let it happen again.
I've never been skiing.
Tom donated a lot of money to us.
Are you a member of the baseball team?
Tom baited the hook.
How old were you when you moved to Boston?
You're vain.
He deserved it.
He walked up to her.
Tom retired and moved to Boston in 2013.
I think that I'm intelligent.
Where do you want to live after you retire?
He still has not written the letter.
Tom is distracted.
I wish it were tomorrow already.
I think Tom and Mary are both drunk.
This is horrible.
Tom's car has tinted windows.
I have trouble concentrating.
He went to New York on business.
Tom was buried yesterday.
Tom talked nonstop for a full hour.
Is this the reason you didn't want me to come?
It seemed like you weren't interested.
They made her marry him.
Tom tried to control his fear.
Tom went berserk.
No one knows his real name.
We have to find out.
Tom doesn't know where.
I'm going to go to the movies.
Don't forget to buy bread.
It is your right.
The phone is busy.
I don't live very far from here.
Is that a good thing?
Tom has been in the hospital for three weeks.
How fast can you do that?
Everybody lies.
Take a moment to imagine what the polar bear's environment is like.
Tom can't afford it.
You're going to be late for school again.
I asked him not to bother me.
Who else did you see?
Tom doesn't want kids.
Yours was better.
Tom didn't like spinach when he was a child.
They are my old friends.
We have to go there together.
You should express your opinion.
"Well, what am I going to do?"
Someone told me that I looked like Tom.
Where did Tom buy the ticket?
This will only take a second.
Tom returned one hour later.
We're almost home.
I wish that I hadn't lied to Tom.
Tom brushed his teeth and put on his pajamas.
I discovered Tom's secret.
Tom and Mary decided to go to Boston together.
Don't touch it.
I'll surprise Tom.
What did you buy it for?
Tom had lost all hope.
Didn't you know the door was locked?
Tom is a famous pianist.
I've completely forgotten his name.
Do you know whether or not Tom will be at the meeting?
How does he know that?
This won't happen again.
I want to write an article.
They'll respond.
I'm glad you could come to the party.
Do you have a Christmas tree?
Tom always tries to set a good example for his children.
My keyboard is broken.
I didn't tell Tom why I didn't want Mary to go to Boston with me.
You almost gave me a heart attack.
I think that's a mistake.
I came to save you.
We can't thank you enough.
I always wanted a daughter.
I need a place to stay for a couple of days.
Did you know peanuts aren't really nuts?
Tom was captured again.
Tom had to run.
I just need to talk to you.
She's teaching us French.
"Concentrate, Tom."
Tom looks a little tired.
Who is your lawyer?
What does this have to do with my family?
It's only ten minutes' walk from here.
Everyone pretended not to listen.
I want a friend.
"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."
Tomorrow is my first day of work.
Tom is digging a hole.
They spoke French.
I won't say a word.
I don't like losing.
Everybody knew that but Tom.
I'd like to know why you did it.
This pen doesn't work.
What time do you leave for school?
I'll solve that problem.
She must have done it yesterday.
Didn't you know that Tom lived in Boston when he was a kid?
Does Tom need anything else?
Tom did it three times.
Tom watched Mary leave.
It has rained since yesterday.
Tom somehow managed to swim across the river.
Don't throw stones at the dog.
"They looked everywhere for him, but couldn't find him anywhere."
They dashed water into my face.
Tom doesn't care.
Stop showing off your iPhone.
You never told me that before.
I had to cancel that order because we didn't have enough money to pay for it.
He hung a picture on the wall.
I wanted to avoid this problem.
His manners aren't those of a gentleman.
I will do it on the condition that you help me.
Tom doesn't like playing tennis with Mary.
You could invite me.
I came back for you.
Where's your baby?
Tom is a firefighter.
You are two-faced.
Tom spends less time studying French than I do.
I suggest you shut up.
He had a traffic accident.
I may be back soon.
I did that once again.
Tom seems to be unwilling to tackle the problem.
I'm waiting for the right woman.
Didn't you know that Tom lived in Boston when he was a kid?
I didn't know Tom would be early.
This book is heavy reading.
You got that right.
Are you sure you can do that?
Nobody pays attention to Tom.
She was accused of telling a lie.
Does it upset you?
I should be there.
The weather today is worse than yesterday.
Tom told Mary the truth.
What kind of nonsense is that?
I know that you'll have a lot of fun.
Why don't we invite Tom to dinner?
The teacher is sitting on the chair.
What did you say?
He gave him a book.
I won't stay here alone.
I will teach you to play chess.
It appears to me that we misunderstand him.
This is the place where Tom and I first met.
I only made three mistakes.
I promise never do that again.
Tom asked for Mary's opinion.
I never asked you to do that.
This isn't what we asked for.
Why did you sign the confession?
"Tom likes skiing, too."
You'll have our complete cooperation.
I thought I told you not to buy anything from that store.
I'd like orange juice.
Can you tell me how to do this?
I had no idea that Tom knew French.
Tom sat in the first row.
Did I wake you?
Tom lives a few miles away.
We'll see what Tom has to say about that.
I'm sure a lot of people would agree with you.
When do you go to bed?
Tom offered Mary money.
You nearly killed me.
Has Tom noticed yet?
Is a thousand yen enough?
Tell us what that means.
Tom won't be busy.
You can always count on Tom.
"If it rains, I'll do that."
You don't have to worry.
The box is heavy.
Should I wait here?
There is nothing to apologize for.
Tom is very particular about what he eats.
Tom and I are the same age.
I know what's going to happen.
He's talking on the telephone.
The radar broke.
Tom ignored Mary's email messages.
I can comfort her.
People are complicated.
I thought Tom wouldn't like me.
Let's go over what we already know.
Would you like to go somewhere and talk?
We're not doing anything right now.
What did you eat for lunch today?
How do you know that light travels faster than sound?
What time do you turn the lights off?
How many did you get?
Why do we need it?
I'm not hungry at all.
Tom doesn't want to play golf with Mary.
Tom let me know that he was planning to stay in Australia for three weeks.
Can't you do that?
He took me by the arm and looked me in the eye.
We went outside for a while.
This is the most beautiful lake that I have ever seen.
Country life is healthier than city life.
I think I know what to do.
There are exceptions.
That's my answer.
Why do you have to do that by yourself?
I love this time of year.
Who knows when Tom's birthday is?
Tom decided not to tell Mary.
I need this one.
I can't do that now.
I've already eaten breakfast.
Can somebody answer the phone?
I have a few tickets in row 15.
I'd go along with that.
I now know why Tom didn't like me.
Everybody will be going.
Are we all ready?
See the example given above.
He admitted that he was guilty.
She is both rich and very beautiful.
Tom will make a good father.
We won't lie to you.
I was really pleased with that.
Tom has to learn French.
Tom is going to give us what we need.
You should visit us more often.
Your new dress really looks good on you.
Don't you like wine?
I don't understand German.
Do you think Tom would help?
How many times do I have to say I'm not married?
Tom said that he was really worried.
He put salt into his cup of coffee by mistake.
Is it true you had a fight with Tom?
That's my line!
Hard work never hurt anyone.
I know how to play the piano.
It's urgent that I see Tom.
The most logical place to keep your shoes is near the door.
Tom says the noise doesn't bother him.
Tom owed Mary money.
Tom doesn't answer me.
My whole body was shaking.
Will you call me when you get there?
Please look after my cats while I'm away.
I've been very busy lately.
They all started laughing at me.
Is the fish still alive?
I'll give you whatever you want.
He came to my rescue.
You're twisting my words.
I grinned.
I didn't let Tom drive.
He's an expert at throwing knives.
We must not be enemies.
It looks like she is a little under the weather.
I didn't know you'd come back.
I will not go to school tomorrow.
This paper is white.
I have to go there.
How old is your car?
He isn't cruel to animals.
This hat belongs to Tom.
Handmade goods are very expensive nowadays.
Is your salary keeping up with inflation?
We're trying to find somebody who can speak French.
I wonder if Tom will agree to do that.
Tom wanted to become a farmer.
Tom has a scar on his face.
Tom rushed to open the door.
How long have you been married to Tom?
I want you to know that I'll always love you.
I have small hands.
Tom is almost ready.
I hear you retired.
It happened on Halloween night.
He knows better than to go there alone.
Go and have a look.
Who else do you plan to invite?
Are you really going to do that?
There is a post office in front of the station.
She has a lot of money.
You never told us why you left Boston.
Tom wrote his name on the blackboard.
You won't be allowed to do that alone.
Tom died in 2013 of natural causes.
I just don't want to talk to you.
How do we know that's true?
Why are you so sad today?
Please leave Tom alone.
"As soon as the game started, it began to rain."
Why aren't you saying anything?
I want to thank you for that.
How long does it take to get there from here?
Tom said that he didn't think it was worth the risk.
Tom is always thoughtful of his parents.
Don't worry. It's OK.
Who do you think helped Tom?
I was going to tell Tom about that.
Who gave it to me?
A helicopter circled over us.
That bothers Tom and me.
Do you really want to run your own business?
Let's go and say hello.
We didn't find it.
Tom was surprised by Mary's request.
Let's give Tom a chance.
Did I show you this?
We love trees.
I can't let you go alone.
Do you have two computers?
It took me a long time to fall asleep.
Tom doesn't even know my name yet.
When did they leave?
I don't think that I'll pass this exam.
I was born and raised here.
I'm afraid I don't know.
I'd decided not to do that anymore.
I love broccoli.
He admonished his son for being lazy.
What time is your Basque class?
I think I'll wait a bit longer.
See you next weekend.
I'll leave it up to you.
I was ushered to my seat.
It's none of Tom's business.
Why are you being so negative?
How can I help you?
I like that kind of thing.
Are you sure that you want to go there?
When will the roses in your garden bloom?
Tom caught three large trout.
Do you know Tom well?
Tom held on to the rope as long as he could.
You shouldn't let children play with the kitchen knife.
I thought everyone was hungry.
The apartment was completely bare when we moved in.
He's stupid.
We didn't see her anywhere.
Tom is the only one Mary can trust.
Tom isn't married anymore.
I want to know why I'm here.
I asked her for a date.
What happens now?
I hate the sound of my voice.
What's your favorite beverage?
Who do you plan to spend Christmas with?
Tom added more wood to the fire.
I didn't know whether to get angry or to laugh.
What a smart guy!
Do you really want Tom to go to Boston with you?
I don't think that anything can be done.
The shirts are dry.
She was worn out from overwork.
Do you know what you need to bring?
Father built me a new house.
This is interesting indeed.
You flatter yourself.
Tom is already halfway to Australia.
I don't think Tom should've done that.
Tom understands he's no longer needed.
What did you talk about?
"I appreciate the gesture, but it's not enough."
I often listen to jazz.
I ate too much.
I found it by chance.
My friends invited me to dinner.
Tom likes to sit on the floor.
"Tom didn't want to go, but his father made him go."
Tom said that he is glad that you're back.
I refuse to leave Boston.
These patterns are identical.
Tom appealed for help.
Who was in Boston with you?
Leave the bottle.
It's all been written.
Why won't my dog eat dog food?
Why are you wearing a tux?
Good for you.
They differ in many respects.
Tom is getting married tomorrow.
This egg is fresh.
Tell me when to begin.
What did Tom do then?
Don't swim in the river.
Can I ask what it is?
Tom and Mary are arguing.
How's your son?
Could you show me how to do that?
"Where are my glasses? ""You left them on the kitchen table."""
I'm giving you one last chance.
I think it's time to take a break.
I think you know that Tom isn't going to do that.

Men want to feel important.
You've got five minutes.
I told Tom to be here tomorrow morning.
The Indians gave the settlers food.
Where did Tom go?
The girl I told you about is from Australia.
Tom knew he had a problem.
I'm not sure if I like this one or that one.
I need a holiday.
They are all very hungry.
"If Tom calls, wake me up."
Put your hands out.
Tom was the only one not wearing a costume.
I also have a daughter.
Tom still hasn't called.
He will never give in even when he is wrong.
I don't believe I'll do that.
Get out of the truck.
I think about him often.
Tom doesn't want to be seen with Mary.
Are you crazy?
"Tom is just sitting on the porch, doing nothing."
Tom had to cover for Mary.
There's something on the table.
I don't want you to pay for it.
Tom very often borrows money from his friends.
You did something that I would never do.
When do you want to do this?
They are hungry.

But Dad won't like it.
I think Tom is stupid.
How is this different?

Tom stared at the sky.
I don't think that Tom knows that I love him.
Please tell her to call me back.
I am the same age.

You and I both know that's not going to happen.
How fast can you do it?
Tom rented a car for the weekend.
They're all talking about his death.

Can I borrow your car?
It's suicide.
We're still living in Boston.

May I ask you a personal question?
Just don't laugh.
This isn't funny.
I said get up!

"Shall I take a message? ""No, thank you."""
You're young and healthy.
You remind me of my son.
He wants to meet you.
You're the most important person in my life.
"By the time I arrived, he had already left."
Every rose has its thorns.

I may have made a mistake.
Anyone home?
Tom said he'll win.
I thought we talked about this already.
Tom is now my assistant.
Tom is better than me.
What have you got?
The sun was hot and they were tired.

Your conduct is absolutely shameful.

Tell us about them.
Are you traveling alone?
Please be honest with yourselves.
I want to know your opinion.
His speech deeply affected the audience.
How are we going to cross the river?
They are going to send up a rocket.
Tom suppressed a yawn.
Talk to Tom again.
They help us.
I ate a cheeseburger.
Did you find Tom?
He is going to start tomorrow.
What kind of person are you?
He wants to be different.
Tom said that you were dead.
She went on with the work.
Did you know Tom died in Boston?
Stand up straight when I'm talking to you!
Tom promised to call Mary.
I hope that all your dreams come true.
Let's find out for sure.
Tom told me he was going home.
Tom didn't want to wait.
I know what people want.
I didn't know you couldn't read.
I've always wanted to say that.
"He knocked on the door, then came in."
What has actually happened here?
I'd never agree to do that.
Tom plans on doing that today.
Who forced Tom to eat a frog?
I was in Australia most of the summer.
I am only joking.
I shouldn't have tried to help Tom.
Grammar is confusing.
It's a never ending cycle.
I thought Tom would get fired.
You haven't made any mistakes.
He deceived his friend.
Please turn left at the first corner.
I can hardly see without my glasses.
Why didn't you ever tell me?
Tom also has a crush on Mary.
This house is not mine.
I did it without you.
I hope you won't mind.
I have nothing else to say.
I want to do it.
We've talked about it.
Tom made Mary stand up.
How much do you spend on food per month?
Tom thought Mary was going to kiss him.
It'll be over soon.
Didn't you know that was happening?
I'll call you in a couple of days.
Did you have a good flight?
She loves me.
You didn't tell me that Tom speaks French.
Come here. I need to tell you something.
I think you're in danger.
How far is it from here to the hotel?
What inspires you most?
I pretended I didn't know anything about that.
I thought Tom might get angry.
I asked Tom if he could recommend a good lawyer.
Tom will miss Mary a lot.
Tom has lived in Boston for over a year.
Tom wondered how fast Mary could climb a ladder.
We trusted you.
I'm beginning to regret not studying French harder.
Do you have Tom's phone number?
I always knew you were innocent.
I will go along with your plan.
He had a headache.
I was invited by Tom.
You can't come in here.
"The more I sleep, the less I feel like working."
I didn't really want to win.
Tom's handwriting is unreadable.
Tom doesn't want to know what's going on.
This is their place.
I wonder whether Tom will help us.
Do you think he will like my gift?
I'm having a hard time concentrating.
I'll ask Tom to wait.
It was too easy.
It was a strange experience.
Please let us know.
That's the hotel.
By what authority do you order me to do this?
You've got three weeks.
I told Tom not to date Mary.
I'd like to have a little talk with you.
I suppose you're right.
Where did you find your key?
You're very different from us.
I am lost.
Look closer.
I'll take that for granted.
The waitress spread a white cloth over the table.
"That kanji is so complex, I can't read it."
Tom didn't know why Mary was absent.
Have you ever been in a car accident?
Can you drive me to the station?
We were very lucky.
Tom didn't give me a chance to talk to him.
They say he's sick.
I hope you come to my concert.
Did you buy Tom a dog?
Did you really visit Australia?
I'm glad to see that you're happy.
Tom doesn't even have a driver's license.
Have you told Tom why you were late?
I think Tom is still home.
I hope it rains tomorrow.
I think Tom didn't understand what you were saying.
Tom is much more fluent in French than I am.
I was ashamed to go out in old clothes.
I've given you everything you've asked for.
Please fix this.
I can't let you in.
Nothing can stop Tom.
I don't think Tom is here.
Why are you packing?
Everyone knows that.
The girl did not say anything.
Did you get a reply from Tom?
I think that we should try again.
I told Tom to go to the dentist.
I had a very good time today.
I want to go outside.
Try not to worry.
You can't leave a baby alone.
That dress looks very good on you.
Put the book back where it was.
I write songs.
Try that on.
Tom has been engaged in politics for years.
Tom got a promotion.
Why doesn't Tom need to do that?
Tom has just gotten divorced.
Many trees were cut down.
Tom didn't help wash the dishes.
I'm more afraid of Tom than I am of Mary.
Everyone has voted.
I agree with you and Tom.
How did you hurt your leg?
Tom asked Mary about John.
Didn't you know peanuts aren't really nuts?
I know I'm adopted.
I don't think that Tom has any plans for Monday.
I fed the goats.
Tom doesn't say much.
Tom is the person I told you about.
"I want to go with you, Tom."
I don't think that it's a bad thing.
I think I've finally understood what you were trying to say.
I want to ask you some more questions.
Can Tom get tickets for us?
Tom closed his eyes tightly.
I thought that you said that Tom wasn't a member of our club.
He acted foolishly.
"In any case, I've already entirely forgiven you."
Tom has written quite a few love letters to Mary.
I'll go right now.
I can't say I'm happy about retirement.
Is the warrior burning the house?
He is bound to pass the test.
I'm terrible at this.
I know this isn't easy for you.
Don't even think about it.
It is too dark for me to read.
When are you going to Boston?
Tom's part-time job is delivering pizzas.
Do you know any ghost stories?
What's in front of you?
I know that Tom doesn't do that anymore.
They have nothing left.
I knew you were lying.
Tom says he's happy.
I'm grateful for what you did.
When did you tell me?
Tom hated all of us.
Stop being so picky.
Tom drowned in the swimming pool.
I think Tom should've left earlier.
It's one of the best known books in Brazilian literature.
What did you do with my jacket?
Why should I help Tom?
He worked ten hours at a stretch.
Use this.
I'd buy it.
Where's the receipt?
Why didn't you tell Tom about that?
Are you going to work today?
Didn't you know that Tom is in Boston now?
I want to talk with you.
The rock flew through the open window.
Did you know Tom would be there?
"Do you love me? ""I don't know."""
Tom says he's planning to buy a gift for Mary.
I wonder why Tom is unmarried.
Tom asked me where my car was parked.
Do you think it's going to rain tomorrow?
Do you know how to play chess?
This chair is missing a leg.
Everyone believed you.
I have been lucky until now.
Tom wanted Mary to accept his gift.
"If I were a boy, I could join the baseball team."
Tom is going to paint his car blue.
Tom called Mary from a public phone.
It's one of the most polluted cities in the world.
I get very angry when you don't answer my questions.
Why wasn't the woman who attacked Tom arrested?
You've spoiled everything.
The book is about the law.
I have hives.
Many of Tom's clients are millionaires.
This time I'm not going with you.
Tom can't eat pork.
We didn't have enough time to finish the job.
He has plenty of money in the bank.
Tom says Mary seldom wins.
Tom promised that he would return soon.
You're the only person that can help me now.
He was told to get off at the station.
I broke the cup.
I totally agree.
There are still people who believe that.
It wasn't a crime.
I know all your secrets.
Tom doesn't have an office.
Tom gave Mary some practical advice.
"Tom was there, but he didn't help us."
I may die tomorrow.
Try to stay objective.
I went from Boston to Chicago by car.
Put it on my desk.
Tom looked at the moon.
I liked your picture.
"He keeps on phoning me, and I really don't want to talk to him."
Tom abandoned that idea.
"Tom is very persistent, isn't he?"
It's very cold now.
Good luck. You'll need it.
Will you come with us?
He wants one.
He did it simply out of curiosity.
My hair stood on end.
I know Tom can win.
I have an appointment with the dentist at 3 o'clock.
Let's not watch TV.
I had to get that off my chest.
We're very happy for you.
Sharks can sense blood.
I'm glad to see you're happy.
Tom doesn't like swimming in pools. He prefers swimming in lakes and rivers.
Tom knew what Mary wanted.
He's hiding in the closet.
They all know I'm a Canadian.
I came as soon as I heard that you needed me.
She kept on working.
Cut it with a knife.
I used to live on Park Street.
No one is sure how many people died.
He didn't do a stitch of work.
Tom earns three times more than I do.
Tom forgot to invite Mary to his party.
You can't wait any longer.
I'm in the tennis club.
Why is Tom outside?
It won't be long before he can play baseball again.
Is Tom feeling better today?
I won't go back there.
Your shirt is wrinkled.
I didn't understand what you said.
Are you her friend?
You can always ask me for help.
I bet you're hungry.
Open the hatch.
"If you want to study in the United States, you need to get a student visa."
I'm never going to get married.
She told me many stories about her life.
"When the phone rang, I was watching TV."
We have to fix this.
Good luck with the new job.
"It's really pretty easy, right?"
Let me see the pictures.
Who came here?
Tom has probably already left for school.
"Tom, I need to talk to you about something serious."
What did you do at school today?
I don't feel like I'm old at all.
Tom is the most influential man in Boston.
I couldn't help crying.
Would it be OK if I asked you a personal question?
Please look again.
Tom still thinks I'm working for Mary.
Is this your first time in Boston?
I'm not coming back.
Do you watch the news on TV every day?
Tom doesn't know what Mary's doing now.
I don't think that I'm very petty.
I need to borrow your car.
I tasted the soup that Tom made.
Let's talk about Boston.
You should look after the children from time to time.
"You have no idea what's going on, do you?"
I learned to cook from my mother.
I remember playing with magnets in kindergarten.
Didn't you know Tom had more than one car?
I can't understand why Tom doesn't want to go with us.
I hope you're not disappointed.
Maybe Tom and Mary will help.
I left my key in my room.
Give me five more minutes.
When will they arrive?
I am Thai.
She felt someone touch her back.
Tom does everything he can to save money.
A bunch of people told me not to eat there.
I thought of you immediately.
I'm still hungry.
I was afraid to speak.
He wants these shirts washed.
I have bought the same camera as you have.
I thought you needed the sleep.
I've made a big mistake.
"Cover your mouth when you cough, sneeze, or yawn."
Australia is a wonderful country.
The children are playing outside.
Tom and Mary were present.
Tom died on Monday.
I need you here.
Mary came up to Tom at the party and told him she had a crush on him.
Are you studying?
Tom will be so proud.
Tom is unfit for duty.
"Well, Tom, you were right."
I stood here for thirty minutes.
Tom talked to a lot of people.
You should've told me that yesterday.
I've decided to stay in Australia.
The train made a brief stop.
Tom also had a sister.
Tom didn't tell me why.
We didn't get your letter until yesterday.
I'm healthy.
Tom isn't young anymore.
I don't have enough money at the moment.
Why can't Tom come with us?
Tell me what you said to Tom.
We have some pressing problems to solve.
Please tell me what I should do in this situation.
I don't think they believe us.
When was the last time you spoke to Tom?
This one's OK.
They talked politics.
"Tom visited Mary, who was in the hospital with a broken bone."
Tom is studying web design.
There is insufficient light to take pictures.
I spent the whole afternoon chatting with friends.
She has wine.
That's my goal.
I can't drive home.
We won't do it.
There are many words with meanings I don't know.
What is this thing called?
Please don't put that on the table.
Tom didn't want me to do that.
I met him at the station.
There's no way I'm going to let you do that.
Tom is younger than you are.
You won't be arrested.
You look like you're homeless.
I doubt that'll ever change.
These stories are very interesting to me.
I'm going to Boston today.
This morning it was very cold.
Is one of you Tom?
Tom is as old as my father.
We've never lived here.
These products are selling like hot cakes.
I stayed up late.
I completely agree with what you're saying.
Please peel the potatoes.
I don't think she can speak French.
I want to speak to Tom.
I don't hate Tom anymore.
The beach is empty.
He was sent to jail for murder.
It looks like Tom has lost a little weight.
Tom is very straightforward.
"You recognized Tom, didn't you?"
I asked Tom how he'd do it.
This pond has a lot of carp.
She didn't tell me her name.
This is Mary's dog.
Tom has already decided to tell Mary.
I don't think that it was Tom and Mary.
Mary is a good girl.
They helped Tom.
I poured water into the bucket.
I know who I'm going to vote for.
I can't tell you that yet.
I trust him completely.
I noticed you weren't at home last night.
Tom and Mary mortgaged their house.
What do you want in return?
Nobody was injured.
It needs washing.
He's shivering because of the cold.
We have some business to discuss.
These trees are beautiful.
"If you want to talk, let's talk."
I'm the one who rescued you.
I have to find another job.
Am I the only one here who doesn't speak French?
I'm still trying to figure out what’s going on.
You don't look very comfortable.
Tom and I wanted to go to Boston together.
Tom is better today than yesterday.
It will not be long before spring comes.
Here's what we want.
My nose is bleeding.
I blame Tom for what happened to all of us.
It's a special occasion.
I'm glad you accepted my offer.
Tell me everything right away.
I've had a very long day.
Why do you need matches?
"OK, I think I get it."
I wonder why Tom needed to do that.
The speaker cleared his throat.
Tom was making a lot of noise.
It wouldn't be a good idea to tell Tom what really happened.
Where are they living now?
Fancy seeing you here.
We're not ready for this.
I think I can help Tom with his homework.
Tom wants us to talk.
We found them.
I'm not used to this cold.
That's completely understandable.
Is Tom drinking coffee?
At times I feel like quitting my job.
"You're not getting away from me that easily, Tom."
The rain prevented him from coming here.
It's just around the corner.
It is a good idea to read this book.
Please pay the tax.
Tom and Mary didn't tell anybody they were planning to do that.
I know that you won't do that.
Tom told me he wasn't in pain.
I can't blame them.
I drank some milk.
"All of a sudden, it began raining."
The guy had a gun.
Tom thought that you were in Boston.
I know a lot of songs.
Did you threaten Tom?
"When I woke up, there was a burglar in my room."
We didn't find anything.
I wonder what Tom can do that I can't do.
Don't just stand there. Call security.
Let him in.
This sentence can be interpreted in two ways.
I want to scratch my nose.
You can fix all this.
How many concerts did you go to last year?
I'm pretty sure that wasn't what Tom meant.
"As the sun rose, the fog disappeared."
It's difficult but not impossible.
I want to grow old with Mary.
The hotel at which we stayed was very comfortable.
He discovered how to open the box.
Tom wanted to know where I lived.
Tom didn't tell me Mary was his fiancée.
Are you having any difficulty breathing?
I didn't dare do that.
I wasn't dreaming.
I've got the car keys.
It is almost 12 o'clock.
You should ask for permission first.
I'm afraid of bats.
I haven't been to Australia.
Tom forgave me.
I'm so glad you called.
I'm in a big hurry.
Have you ever been attacked by a dog?
We're just trying to protect you.
I wonder whether Tom is sleeping.
I don't know what it sounds like.
We wanted the same thing you wanted.
Destiny is sometimes cruel.
I needed it yesterday.
I don't know anything about geology.
May I sit down?
I don't know where to put them.
It was pretty hard.
Tom is a child prodigy.
Water has no calories.
What other choice did I have?
Tom helped Mary carry her suitcases.
Don't count me out.
We didn't talk very much.
Tom can't leave now.
I don't think it's such a bad idea.
I didn't want to spend my whole life there.
I don't want you touching my stuff.
Tom has lost his keys three times this week.
How many languages can you speak fluently?
That was an unkind remark.
Tom told me that he was worried.
It cost me one thousand yen to get the bicycle fixed.
They saw us as they were getting off the train.
I want to be like you.
We assumed you were dead.
Is French a difficult language to learn?
"School being over, we went swimming in the pool."
Tom couldn't suppress his anger.
Can I kiss you?
I thought Tom had given up.
He described what had happened in detail.
Don't just stand there. Do something.
Take our picture.
Can I have some more candy?
I think Tom would like that.
I can easily touch my toes.
Tell Tom to leave me alone.
He must be lacking in common sense.
Let me tell you something about myself.
I'll try to do the same.
"I've never told anyone that before, not even my mother."
Why do you think Tom likes chess so much?
I am seeing a friend tomorrow.
I was hit by the policeman.
Tom doesn't think we'll win.
"All right, I'll do it."
This doesn't look too bad.
This is homemade jam.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
You're irresponsible.
I picked Tom up from school.
We like games.
I'm too tired to argue.
Children need a happy home environment.
All my friends have children.
This is highly unusual.
These garments are made from wool.
Tom took off his clothes.
Tom squashed the bug.
It is almost three.
It is polite to open doors for people.
Tom must've had his reasons.
Tom woke Mary up at 6:30 and she wasn't happy about that.
Tom is a veterinarian.
The car stopped in the middle of the road.
"With your help, we'll catch Tom."
Call it what you like.
The office is empty.
Make me some coffee.
I think I know you.
Do you and Tom live near each other?
I should've kissed Mary.
I'll never listen to Tom again.
I'm too busy.
I don't think television will take the place of books.
Everyone knows that.
Have you considered my offer?
Tom was rushed to the hospital after being found unconscious in his home.
I didn't know what I was getting into.
Buy the full version.
Tom has to find Mary.
Put it on Tom's desk.
I told you to get out of here.
Tom isn't as smart as me.
Tom copied all the files on his internal hard disk to an external hard disk.
I think I've understood.
Tom stole my idea.
How many eggs are there?
Tom arrived home at 2:30.
It is no use talking to him. He never listens.
It smells good!
I didn't say you were going to enjoy it.
How much cheese did Tom eat?
I wonder what happens if I press this button.
"Doubtless there exists in this world precisely the right woman for any given man to marry and vice versa; but when you consider that a human being has the opportunity of being acquainted with only a few hundred people, and out of the few hundred that there are but a dozen or less whom he knows intimately, and out of the dozen, one or two friends at most, it will easily be seen, when we remember the number of millions who inhabit this world, that probably, since the earth was created, the right man has never yet met the right woman."
I thought there was nobody in the kitchen.
They're washing their hands.
The police have surrounded the building.
Just be careful with that.
They're children.
How much time do I have left?
I can explain that.
Let's sit down here.
Go sit down.
Let's shake hands.
"Mary, are you decent?"
Tom is no match for Mary.
I bet you don't remember me.
I suffer from asthma.
"Once you begin, you must continue."
I didn't unlock that door.
You should stay in the hospital for treatment.
Have you filed a grievance?
Did Tom come here?
I've got to go to the men's room.
"Are you guys from Austria, or is it Australia?"
He said that he would call you later.
Tom hasn't heard from Mary since she moved to Boston.
Could you please speak a little slower?
I wonder if he likes me.
I hope I never have to go back to Boston.
I'm not going to let Tom drive.
The cause of the accident is unknown.
Who else did you help?
Tom doesn't have a lot of time.
"Use your other hand, too."
Tom said that he was really lonely.
Tom misjudged Mary.
You told me to improvise.
Where can I get tickets?
I love a good party.
He's in prison.
I saw a ghost last night.
Who do you believe?
How many times have you visited Australia?
I hear you got fired.
Have you tried it?
I'll get there before you will.
He could swim very well when he was young.
It's the least I could do.
Nobody came to work this morning.
Tom is in his thirties.
Why did you invite Tom to the party?
Tom asks for my advice from time to time.
I don't think Tom can hear me.
Tom pried up the floorboards looking for the hidden gold coins.
I know those women.
I wish I could be there with you.
Tom put his phone in his pocket.
"Hopefully, it won't happen again."
It'll take too long.
"Tom and Mary have already finished, haven't they?"
I don't have a partner.
Tom called me stupid.
Was that what Tom said?
A yard is three feet.
I don't think Tom is going to want to go to Boston with you.
I'm late for class.
Who brought the cake?
You were great.
I was a grave digger for thirty years.
"At night, she gazed at the moon."
"I'd be angry, too."
I won't forget.
I'm on strike.
I have nothing to do with this matter.
You're so talented.
The doctor made the correct diagnosis.
You're safe now.
I was stuck in traffic.
Everybody knows that I hate Tom.
Tom seems to be seasick.
"If you won a million yen, what would you do?"
Let's hurry.
That man is in love with my sister.
Rinse with warm water.
I will give you this.
Don't compare yourself to me.
I must return some books to the library.
I don't want to talk about what's happened.
I felt a sharp pain in my side.
Do you actually know how to do this?
"Not feeling well, I stayed home on that day."
Tom didn't want to change that.
I think I'd be a good teacher.
I want to buy a gift for Tom.
Do you know me?
You may use mine if you want.
Do you have any pictures of Tom when he was a kid?
I think he's a competent person.
Is everything OK at home?
I thought that you'd come.
He threw the ball.
Could you kill someone?
I want to come back here tomorrow.
Is your room warm?
His accent suggests he is a foreigner.
I think it's time for me to get a dog.
It's just a placebo.
Tom can barely make ends meet.
I like your apartment a lot.
It is impossible for me to answer the question.
He laughed.
You need our help.
What would you call that?
How would you describe yourself?
I met Tom there.
I don't know how to read yet.
How many people were killed?
Your memory is good.
I thought that Tom was still living in Boston.
It's pretty expensive.
He has over a million dollars in assets.
I'm trying my best to forget that.
Tom does that everywhere.
It was fantastic.
Could Tom be wrong?
Destroy it.
I have Tom's keys.
Have you made up your mind what you're going to give Tom for his birthday?
"In your position, I'd probably have done the same thing."
Would Tom do it?
I thought you needed money.
You must not jump to conclusions.
Tell Tom not to do that.
When are you off?
I'm going to talk to Tom myself.
Thank you for your letters.
I don't know who this belongs to.
He was too curious.
I can run the fastest of the three.
The doctor told him to give up smoking and drinking.
There will be an economic crisis at the end of this year.
I heard somebody screaming.
She saw herself in the mirror.
He's a bit drunk.
I know that Tom helped you.
You're naive.
Tell Tom this is urgent.
Are you crazy?
My husband is in jail.
Tom still wants Mary.
I looked in the mirror.
A lot has happened while you've been gone.
I bet you can't do this.
You're actually wrong.
Did you steal it?
Are you sure this is the right number?
He became famous.
Nice to meet you.
Don't forget to vote.
I've made a mistake.
You're going to pay for this.
Tom gave Mary a present.
The coat doesn't have any pockets.
He ignored me.
What did you want to do?
"Tom loved Mary, you know."
Tom still wants you to help him.
Tom is hoping nothing bad happens.
Stop acting like a baby.
Tom had no one to discuss his problems with.
Do you think Tom bought that?
Tom let the cat out.
My arm hurt yesterday.
I've already sold my car.
We already gave it to you.
Tom went hiking.
Did Tom tell you not to do that?
Is your left leg still hurting?
Tom started to eat.
I'll do whatever I have to.
Tom had to wait three hours.
I don't think that Tom does that anymore.
Have you seen my coat?
We must look after her children this evening.
You'll have to try one.
It's been raining for three days now.
Do you need to leave now?
I hate my mother-in-law.
Tom has been warned more than once.
What did you do on Monday?
Tom wanted to talk with Mary.
I'm the one who should apologize.
Tom doesn't want to lose Mary.
He looks pale.
I won't sing.
Tom asked me why I didn't want to live in Australia anymore.
It takes courage.
No one has been fired yet.
Tom is looking for a suitable place to hold the meeting.
Where can I get information?
Did you go out last night?
"I'm still your prisoner, aren't I?"
I don't think that Tom knows what kind of person Mary is.
I'm concerned about the result of the exam.
I asked Tom to do that with Mary.
Why aren't you in jail?
I like a lot of things.
I didn't know you were so lonely.
Did you say 30?
Please come to the point.
Tom caught a slight cold.
What do you call this insect in English?
I'd like to speak with Tom alone.
I handed the letter to Tom.
Tom jumped overboard.
Do you have enough money for the trip?
Tom would like that.
Aren't we going?
He was summoned to appear in court.
I told Tom about what had happened.
Could you turn off the TV?
You have to eat something.
I suspect that you don't have to do that.
Why did you do this to me?
Broken glass lay scattered all over the road.
We've got a room for you.
I don't really like this restaurant.
Is this book boring?
"Next time, I'll do it myself."
Thanks for the food.
Please remember that.
I wish I could take back all those terrible things I said about you last night.
The bartender asked Tom to pay his tab.
One of us will attend the meeting.
Please stop it.
Please don't open the window.
This is romantic.
I completely disagree with you.
I want you to lose.
I'm afraid that I was right.
Just talk with Tom.
Tom is always drunk.
What's wrong with this one?
Please don't make me do it.
How can I turn down the air conditioner?
The students are making good progress in English.
A shot rang out.
No one can help Tom.
You don't have to eat it if you don't want to.
Mary has always wanted to be a nurse.
I don't think Tom and Mary are brother and sister.
This CD costs $10.
You're the one who told me that.
You're a horrible driver.
Don't gloat.
That is a strange sentence.
I have longer legs than Tom.
How much did they give you for your old car?
She tried to hide her feelings.
"If everything goes according to plan, I should be back home again tomorrow night."
We'll help you find Tom.
I think it's about time to go.
"According to the thermometer, it's thirty degrees outside."
I don't see anyone wearing a hat.
I thought you wouldn't tell her that we hadn't done our homework.
Why didn't you buy a Japanese car?
Don't throw it away.
It's fine now.
Tom isn't my problem.
You need protection.
Tom called us.
A man appeared from behind the door.
I don't play the piano.
I'm occupied at the moment.
Now it's my brother's turn.
She sat down and crossed her legs.
Why don't we leave early today?
Dust had accumulated on the desk.
"According to Tom, there was a misunderstanding."
Stay home until six.
Tom always wants to do things his own way.
Those who were there thought it was pure gold.
I know that that won't happen again.
About thirty insurgents were killed.
Can you believe it?
What did she reply?
How many zoos are there in Australia?
They are wrestlers.
I've already eaten supper.
I missed my flight. Can I get on the next flight?
Tom can't play the guitar.
How often does that happen at this time of year?
That's my wish.
Tom wasn't involved in that scandal.
You were told to stay on the ship.
You won't get rid of me so easily.
Are you able to tell the difference between butter and margarine?
What was the question?
This book is too difficult for me to understand.
My alarm didn't go off this morning.
You came at just the right time.
Tom also has a daughter.
"Please be on time. If you're late, we'll leave without you."
Are you content?
Tom strangled Mary.
It's best for Tom not to be left alone in that frame of mind.
When was the last time you watered the garden?
I want to close the account.
Tom was covered with mud.
I'm feeling sad for Tom.
I have a lot of pencils.
What do you think is going to happen?
Please look at this.
Do you want this T-shirt?
Let's wait until 2:30.
Tom bought a present for his daughter's friend.
"Look, I'm serious."
It's going to take a while to get this done.
Who were you with?
Tom says Mary isn't often late.
"If I tell the truth, I'll be killed."
Man is the only animal that can use fire.
You look a bit better today.
I am so tired that I can hardly walk.
Tom isn't the one who needs help.
Tom is a dance teacher.
My wife left me.
Tom looked at his dog and his dog looked at him.
"I like almonds, but not peanuts."
"Instead of going to Boston next summer, let's go to Chicago."
Tom and Mary haven't decided on a date for their wedding yet.
Don't forget to mail this letter on your way to school.
Boston is one of the most interesting cities I've ever visited.
I'd like to talk to the hotel manager.
We do that all the time.
I knew Tom wasn't going to lose.
Everyone can't be a winner.
My car is parked next to Tom's.
Tom is fat and ugly.
I know that you don't live here anymore.
It's not working.
Any suggestions?
I don't need your permission to do this.
Who is Tom to you?
The server was down.
These are fresh.
I hope Tom didn't try to do that.
Tom digitized an old family photo and emailed it to his mother.
Tom has flat feet.
I advised Tom not to go to Australia.
"If I were you, I wouldn't do that kind of thing."
I think you know we need to hurry.
I don't think that Tom knows why you want me to do that.
A is the first letter of the alphabet.
When was the last time you played soccer?
They're right behind me.
You'll want to write this down.
Tom wanted money.
Tom decided that it wasn't necessary to go into the office today.
You don't know how much money I owe.
They want me to talk to Tom.
Tom has oily skin.
I am a new student.
Tom remained there until 2013.
Tom didn't say where he'd met Mary.
They arranged a meeting.
I usually use a credit card instead of cash.
Asians eat a lot of rice.
I think it's time for me to talk to the boss about this problem.
I invited some friends for dinner. I hope you don't mind.
She accepted his hand in marriage.
My brother helped me solve the math problem.
Tom doesn't know where he's going.
Would you do that if you had the chance?
You've lost.
"Tom had a chance to do that, but he didn't."
Tom stopped talking.
Are the elevators working?
Where is the nearest subway station?
I don't want to waste your time.
I honestly don't know.
Did you already eat at home?
You aren't guilty.
Tom never wrote Mary back.
This is our country.
Did you sleep yesterday afternoon?
Have you ever seen Tom dance?
He has been to England twice.
He's always complaining.
Now I recognize you.
I hadn't heard that.
What a big supermarket!
Tom needed to rest.
Tom is clearly insane.
Tom likes pop music.
You shouldn't have brought Tom with you.
Tom doesn't mind.
I've decided to stay in Boston for a few more days.
Put on your pajamas.
Which floor is it on?
I gave up.
Will it rain tomorrow?
Your job is to find it.
Don't intrude on her privacy.
It's in good hands.
This picture reminds me of my childhood.
This will quench your thirst.
You made my day.
I walked along the footpath.
I think you did that on purpose.
Most students come to school on foot.
Give me a glass of milk.
I like watching movies in French.
Tom thinks Mary can't do that.
Do you know anybody there?
I didn't know Tom would do that.
Are you going to study French?
I want you here tomorrow by 2:30.
I want to increase my vocabulary.
Tom said he'd come.
I don't want to drink cold tea.
Have you arrived yet?
Close your eyes.
This dictionary has 12 volumes.
Tom wasn't a brave man.
Has this ever happened to you?
I'm surprised you moved back to Boston.
There is no meat left in the fridge.
"Tom seldom, if ever, does that."
We couldn't go out because of the rain.
I think he likes you.
We agree on everything.
What have you done with my bag?
Tom saw Mary catch a fish.
It is better to take your time than to hurry and make mistakes.
"Let's begin, OK?"
We'll be in touch.
Why are you going?
I can't believe Tom told you that.
Where did Tom study French?
Are you pulling my leg?
Tom painted the doors blue.
I don't like this idea at all.
I suddenly missed my watch.
I don't need to be here.
I'm a bad golfer.
Tom is a good cook.
Don't you trust me?
Tom died in his sleep.
We can't change what has happened.
I am a poor man.
I wanted Tom to write a recommendation for me.
Nobody came to my rescue.
My savings will run out soon.
"For one thing, I couldn't afford to do that."
I think Tom now understands.
Tom will be sleeping by the time we get there.
Tom took a shortcut through a dark alley.
That's a fine way to treat a friend!
I haven't thought about it.
That's terrifying.
The traffic was terrible.
I didn't even know that you had a horse.
I need a calendar.
I'd like to interview Tom.
I've known Tom for 13 years.
I can't remember why.
Did Tom say why he was leaving?
Did you draw that?
I don't want that to happen.
The letter Tom received said that he should return home as soon as possible.
Have you and Tom ever kissed each other?
We're so proud of you!
You think you're so clever.
"You don't agree, do you?"
The good news is that you're not going to die.
Tom was talking about me when I entered the room.
You should talk to Tom.
He scares easily.
"These flowers are for Mary, not for you."
I didn't attend his funeral.
I still believe in love.
My daughter has grown out of this suit.
Tom said he'd wait.
"I've just had a hot bath, so I feel much better."
I am dozing off.
I'm unlikely to ever do that again.
Everyone thinks Tom and I are a couple.
You and I both know you were the one who broke the window.
We can catch them.
She continued her talk.
I didn't answer Tom.
Tom put on a gas mask.
Did you make coffee?
Tom can leave if he wants.
Tom's parents thought that he was too young to live by himself.
Tom plowed the whole field in three hours.
Can I help you?
What am I here for?
My daughter is a tomboy.
We need evidence.
I never want to see you again.
Give me a spoon.
You need to change your lifestyle.
I want to live in the country.
I wasn't even sure you knew it.
The plane took off at seven.
I've always wanted to meet Tom.
Who should start?
Tom will be retiring next year.
Do alligators lay eggs?
I folded all the towels.
When are they coming?
What is all that stuff?
It's all your fault.
Are you jealous?
"You know where Tom lives, don't you?"
Tom felt awkward.
I'm looking forward to meeting with you the next time I visit your town.
You're being called.
How many boys are there in this class?
Tom put the drinks on the table.
I'm looking for a gift for my father.
I love the way you hold me.
Tom rarely asks questions.
Tom wanted to talk to Mary.
Don't be greedy.
Stop hitting me.
You'll be ready.
You're completely right.
Tom and Mary aren't going to wait for us.
Tom told us an interesting story.
My father goes to church on Sunday.
I want you to tell the truth.
I think that there's a ghost in our attic.
What time did they leave?
Money doesn't buy happiness.
Tom used to hate spinach.
Get Tom away from me.
Tom introduced Mary to his family.
How is your grandmother?
Is there anything we can do for you?
I think that the problem is here.
Tom really wanted to go to Boston.
I know Tom is just a child.
I am happy to hear your voice.
They let the bird out of the cage.
We're going to have to change our plans.
I don't want Tom to help me.
Tom won't speak to me and I don't know why.
She is proud of her children.
I can't tell you how stupid this makes me feel.
I borrowed it.
You don't have to sit with me.
Tom will break up with Mary.
I never wore that hat again.
"Tom, put these gloves on."
Tom was wearing a white shirt.
Snakes are cold-blooded creatures.
Her mother must have smelled something fishy.
We all need to calm down.
We're in the house.
Please don't leave the door open.
I've met you before.
Tom begged me to help Mary.
Tom asked Mary what her favorite color was.
I think all of us need to do that.
Tom has a big truck.
What's your favorite subject in school?
Why didn't you help Tom escape?
His son is eight years old.
How many glasses of wine do you drink every day?
Aren't you Tom?
She's a lot older than he is.
Boston is a very beautiful city.
"I did that wrong, didn't I?"
She tried a third time.
The water is clean.
Tom is afraid something bad is going to happen.
Aren't you sure?
You should've expected us.
Can you identify the problem areas?
Have you ever been drunk?
Are there any other hotels you can recommend?
Tell them to stop.
You should've never interfered.
You should think about your future.
You can easily judge the ripeness of a banana by the color of its peel.
"I waited for Tom for three hours, but he never showed up."
Please show me around Boston.
Did you learn that from Tom?
Tom told me to wash my hands.
How are things?
I wanted to tell you.
Did Tom ask you about that?
Neither Tom nor Mary has been arrested.
I am a very good chess player.
I am undressing.
Where were you today?
The sea gulls are flying low.
I can't do anything to help you.
Tom dropped a cup on the floor and it shattered into a thousand pieces.
I'm going to be in Boston next week.
Are you ready to go?
Give it to him.
Everyone likes it here.
When will you complete the preparations?
I could hear footsteps coming up the stairs.
They have failed.
I don't believe we've been introduced.
Surely you don't believe that.
You need to learn to be more tolerant.
She choked him.
Chew your food well.
I've already told Tom where to park his car.
Can you wait outside?
Tom was last seen alive on October 20th.
I know you'll agree with me.
We may need it soon.
He is content with the simple life.
What was it that brought you to me?
I haven't laughed like that in a long time.
I remember that I met the queen.
I'll die.
Tom won't listen to my advice.
I'm having fun.
Which search engine do you use?
"You've never had a boyfriend, have you?"
I did everything I was supposed to.
I'm anxious to see you.
Tom doesn't want to argue with you.
That's what I meant.
I totally agree with what you say.
Tom knew that I was busy.
Tom is going to the concert.
Find out who they are.
I'm not frightened.
This is one of the best restaurants in town.
Tom is a good writer.
I made her play the piano against her will.
How many times have you swum across this river?
"You can't read French, can you?"
Do you love my brother more than me?
May I borrow it?
Do you eat a lot?
I'm sorry I doubted you.
I have three times more books than you do.
Our world is only a tiny part of the universe.
I have to get up early.
Tom is greedy.
Stay close.
"Tom was my friend, too."
Invite anyone you want.
Would you like us to help you?
What's wrong with all of you?
May I please be excused for a minute?
Have you seen Tom's new car?
I love comedies.
They were both drunk.
Do you have any questions?
Why can't you just leave me alone?
Tom didn't expect anything from Mary.
Have you been told when you are expected to be here?
Now you listen to me.
Hasn't he looked at himself in a mirror?
That's not quite what I wanted.
Why didn't you tell me about that?
I had a nightmare last night.
I wish I hadn't eaten the sandwich that Tom made for me.
They're all alike.
It doesn't sound too bad.
"Tom, have you eaten yet?"
Tom saved a seat for me.
Tom doesn't know whether Mary is dead or alive.
Tom told me he could fix it.
Tom is dating my daughter.
What are you guys talking about?
I have gained weight.
You'd better think up a good excuse for being late.
Did you say thank you?
Have you been mistreated?
I didn't expect this to happen.
It took us half an hour to set up the tent.
A child today would not do that.
I need to talk to Tom first.
It's good to have you with us.
Tom fell asleep thinking about Mary.
Where exactly did you put it?
She advised him not to use too much salt.
That's highly unlikely.
How many dogs have you had?
We must get rid of Tom.
I don't want to do this.
That's what Tom says.
Tom is likely to say no.
Tom said he'll visit Boston.
I don't think that you need to do that.
You look beautiful.
I'm bad at sports.
I've already given Tom what he asked for.
Have you fed the dog?
Did you hurt your back?
I asked Tom to sing my favorite song.
You're who I need now.
Tom swore he hadn't seen Mary all day.
"I don't like Tom, and he doesn't like me."
Wolves don't usually attack people.
Tom refused to let me in.
You told me to do that.
Just ask Tom about it.
Can you buy one for me as well?
You won't believe what happened to me today.
There was nothing Tom could do to help Mary.
Tom drinks only bottled water.
Tom didn't want to waste any more time calculating how much time had been wasted.
You don't seem very pleased.
The water there was so deep that I could not touch bottom.
Tom is the one who introduced Mary to me.
They ruined it.
A lot of foreigners visit Japan every year.
"As soon as I've finished doing that, I'll help you."
"Keep it together, Tom."
I can't understand why she doesn't love me anymore.
Did you work last night?
Thanks for your quick reply.
Tom didn't like the plan.
She woke him up.
Are you sleepy?
You'll get used to it one day.
The tropical sun glared down relentlessly.
We ate breakfast at seven.
We want Tom to play a song or two for us on his banjo.
That's what I'd want.
It's almost like magic.
I'm on the phone with Tom now.
I won't let Tom hurt you.
Private detectives were hired to look into the strange case.
They collected shells on the beach.
Tom is tired after working all day.
There have been no problems so far.
I wish you'd been there.
Tom sat in front of me.
Tell us about Tom.
I just wanted to wish you luck.
Has anybody spoken to you?
Could you give me a ride?
"You don't like me anymore, do you?"
You may use my car.
We need another day to finish this job.
Can we change history?
Everyone worked very hard.
I can speak to Tom.
Tom is ironing his shirts.
They were scattered in all directions.
My wife is very unpredictable.
Didn't I warn you not to go there?
Tom is carrying a violin under his arm.
You need a keycard to open the door.
Your thirty minutes are almost up.
We can't tolerate that kind of behavior.
I can't recall all their names.
Take whichever you like best.
What happened with Tom?
I thought that you hated Australia.
Tom won't be happy about that.
Are you afraid of dogs?
The waiter came over to the table.
I know that Tom is overweight.
Tom was sent home.
"Here, try these."
She must be very happy.
I'm such a blabbermouth.
I have absolutely nothing to do.
Did you order the book?
Are you up?
I bought a dog for Tom.
You have to tell us.
Ask and you shall receive.
Tom doesn't like surprises.
He told me not to tell lies.
"That's a fake beard, isn't it?"
What I want is a big juicy steak.
Why aren't you doing your homework?
We traveled in South America.
I don't see your car.
They need customers.
I don't believe that Tom is guilty.
She is absent because of sickness.
Do you think it helped?
"If Tom doesn't do what we've asked him to do, he'll regret it."
Don't come in. I'm naked.
Tom has two choices.
I'll finish reading this novel soon.
Tom explained it again.
Where do I start?
I was happy I did that.
Don't eat the fruit in the bowl on the table. It's plastic.
I am a nurse.
They all speak French.
Tom doesn't want to go alone.
What would you have done in my place?
Tom certainly had a point when he said we should allow more time to complete the project.
All of the windows were closed.
I could actually have broken a leg.
I can put things in a box.
Swimming is a very useful skill.
Wash your hands with soap and water.
His proposal is not worth talking about.
Some people are afraid of dogs.
Tom told me not to take anything.
I only have one so far.
Do you mind if I sit next to you?
Tom and Mary stood to leave.
Am I wasting my time?
"I wish you were wrong, but I know you're right."
Nobody equals him in strength.
Please give me back my money.
"Unfortunately, it rained yesterday."
I thought Tom would like it.
We had a quick lunch at a cafe.
I can't forget you.
I have to get it back.
She is only a child.
I know Tom isn't a very good lawyer.
I'd like to make a phone call.
Was Tom the one who gave you that?
The weather is fine today.
It's been weeks since it's rained.
I'm sure that's true.
They even listened to music.
Tom and Mary were very happy.
Let's not discuss this in front of the children.
Tom was kidding.
Tom's bed's empty.
Tom has got nothing.
That's why I brought you here.
I have just arrived. I haven't even unpacked my bags.
Where's the fire?
Tell Tom not to tell Mary.
Tom will come at 2:30.
We had big plans for you.
I doubt it.
I accepted his invitation.
I'm going to confess.
Were you alone?
Tom didn't tell me he lived in Boston.
He agreed with me.
He gave money to each of his sons.
What's Tom reading now?
Tom told me he didn't need my help.
Tom moved here a few months ago from Boston.
What was I supposed to do?
I forgot my briefcase.
Where can I park the car?
Tom told me Mary was lonely.
Please tell me what we're doing here.
Do you want a piece of candy?
I can't help but think that maybe someday you and I'll get married.
"Do you have the key? ""Yes, I have it."""
That's an offensive question.
Tom poured himself a drink.
That's not acceptable.
Tom usually starts his day with a hot cup of coffee.
I don't often wear corduroys.
I bought a new handbag.
The picnic was held in the gym on account of the rain.
Quit wasting time.
Tell Tom I've a broken leg.
I'm replaceable.
Do you believe Judas betrayed Jesus Christ?
Tell her that I am coming.
What color is your new coat?
Tom won't be a problem.
There's no need to hide.
Tom asked me to go with Mary.
Don't pressure Tom.
The nail that sticks out gets hammered down.
Tom loved all of us.
We're out of time.
We're starving.
Why did you tell Tom that you don't know me?
Every second counted.
Your shoes are untied.
The cat is lazy.
I'll be back by then.
What've you been doing recently?
I'm packed and ready to go.
None of us can speak French.
You're the only person I've told.
I won't stay here alone.
Tom's having a good time.
Tom was holding a knife in his right hand.
This apple is sweet.
We must think about these plans in terms of what they would cost.
He can also speak Russian.
Tom knows who stole your car.
Why did Tom want you dead?
I know you miss Tom.
That guy over there looks just like Tom.
I should be back by 2:30.
How many songs has Tom written?
Did you understand me?
Tom was told not to leave.
All of my attempts have failed.
I've decided to stay.
I'm looking for a present for Tom.
How much does that software cost?
I was three hours too late.
I've told you what to do.
My pulse is fast.
I'm addicted.
Has Tom eaten yet?
Aren't you going to help us?
I have no idea what this is.
Do you want coffee?
I wouldn't like that.
How could Tom do such a thing?
Would you tell Tom I'm ready?
Tom told me he was going to sell his house.
Tom said that he was Canadian.
I've forgotten your address.
We walked along the beach.
I wanted to have children.
The classroom is empty.
Never go anywhere alone.
Your friends are late.
Tom said that he'd like to win.
Leave them alone.
Is that radio yours?
Is your school far away from your house?
Tom wants to work at the same hospital where Mary works.
The future will come soon enough.
I can't speak French as well as Tom can.
Why would Tom be angry?
Tom used to be a teacher.
That's what I want most of all.
I'd like you to accompany me.
Tom is going to take Mary to Boston with him.
I have to clean up my apartment.
Mary wanted to be a nurse.
I agree with everything Tom said.
He doesn't have any proof.
Let's get a little closer.
How can you say such a foolish thing?
It cost me a fortune to get my car repaired.
I remember seeing you last year.
Someone has to pay the bill.
Why did you tell Tom first?
Why aren't you married?
They talked all night.
Tom often feels drowsy after eating lunch.
Tom helped us win.
Could you sign here?
I don't yet know what we need to do.
Tom is considered an expert in his field.
Where's your hotel?
It's Tom's 30th birthday tomorrow.
Could it have been Tom?
I'm eating now.
Tell me how to do that.
Sit still.
Give me a minute.
He's a rather rare individual.
Mary is a retired nurse.
Tom likes that.
You don't have to go to school tomorrow.
He took me for my twin brother.
You'll be missed by your friends.
He's a slacker.
You are early.
"If you don't eat, you'll die."
I ran into Tom the other day.
Perhaps I'm wrong.
I was asked to speak in French.
I'm not happy about this.
Come here quickly.
Tom needs to finish what he started.
"If the alarm rings, walk, don't run."
I've already seen it.
I don't think that Tom has enough money to buy a ticket.
My shoes are brown.
I've lived most of my life in the plains where trees and hills are scarce.
His songs were very popular with young people.
"Come with us, please."
Tom knew that Mary wouldn't cry.
I'd like to come with you.
Did you drink tea yesterday?
I haven't done that in a long time.
Do you like playing computer games?
"If I can do that, so can you."
Tom wanted to buy it.
Tom said he wouldn't do it.
That's immoral.
I am a widow.
Tom understands me.
I'm eating now.
Is that the map that Tom gave you?
Tom sat next to me.
I hope that you're not afraid.
She is already back.
I need to get to the hospital.
It's going to be cold tonight.
It seems you were right.
She decided to marry Tom.
I don't see what you're so concerned about.
Are we being chased?
This is all I need to know.
It was very beautiful.
"I am not tired. ""Neither am I."""
I'm not sure that Tom wants to do that.
Do you play the piano?
The two left.
Any book will be okay as long as it is interesting.
I urgently need you.
I'm not used to this cold weather.
Don't point your finger at me.
I'm getting angrier.
We took turns driving.
What're you going to do now?
We don't have the time to discuss this right now.
I hope you like this.
We should talk about it.
Tom and Mary met each other in Boston.
We're about ready.
She invited Tom and me to the party.
This doesn't help.
Your English is perfect.
Do you know Tom's last name?
I like potatoes.
Tom never listens to the teacher.
"If he had studied harder, he would have passed the exam."
Whose books are these?
Tom is too tired to study.
Tom only has one arm.
I think his name is Tom.
I'm still working.
I love that place.
I've already told you everything that I know about that.
Short skirts are already out of fashion.
Is that your book?
Tom realized something wasn't right.
Playing the piano isn't easy.
Interest rates will rise due to monetary tightening.
I brought some friends with me.
He is a good fellow.
"Would I only work on weekends if I could? Of course, I would."
Tom is getting married in Boston.
Tom stayed in Boston for a few days.
Behave like a man.
I like your idea.
Tom never returned home.
I learned my lesson.
The rules are very clear.
I was slightly surprised.
Tom isn't your brother.
We know what needs to be done.
They rejected my proposal.
Tom took his wedding ring off.
We're not staying.
Are you relaxed?
I like you better.
He is a scientist who is respected by everybody.
Did you vote for Tom or Mary?
Tom used to work in a bank.
Try to stay awake.
He hasn't left any message.
The dog bit the man.
Our negotiations broke off.
Look in the phone book.
Get up out of bed.
I didn't know you were French teachers.
Tom is glad.
I finished first.
"Here, take my coat."
Neither of the two answers are right.
Why are your eyes so big?
We don't stand a chance.
We're open tomorrow.
Maybe it was just a coincidence.
The police fished a dead body out of the river this morning.
When did you find out?
Tom doesn't let Mary do that.
Tom is very sleepy and can hardly keep his eyes open.
We need to try again.
You were great.
It's my only chance.
My mother is always busy.
The movie is about to start.
I never go to bed before midnight.
I think we need to change our plans.
Tom fell asleep halfway through the movie.
I want to watch television.
Do you have experience?
I'm going to make you a drink.
When did you start studying languages?
Tom appears to be wise.
Tom shouldn't trust Mary.
The British captured Breed's Hill.
I live in my uncle's house.
I came here looking for Tom.
"When he heard the whistle, he crossed the street."
I'm sorry that I did that without you.
What does Tom know about me?
I want to tell her the truth.
Let's try!
You're too good to me.
What fruit would you like to have for dessert?
The telephone is among the inventions attributed to Bell.
I don't think I offended anyone.
I had a friend die recently.
I know exactly how to fix it.
He doesn't know yet.
Don't leave the room.
You've gotten better.
Tom's hungry.
Tom talks very loud.
I sat down next to someone I didn't know.
Where can I park the car?
Tom didn't do that right.
Tom isn't going to do that right now.
That's not allowed.
Tom gets paid very well.
Tom said he didn't know what Mary wanted him to buy.
You take after your mother. You remind me of her.
You have a fertile imagination.
They look worried.
Tom knows why you cried.
The express train does not stop between Shibuya and Naka-Meguro.
Tom couldn't help worrying about Mary.
He can do better.
I'm Tom's roommate.
Come again any time.
"In my opinion, you are wrong."
My mother is writing a letter now.
I'm happy with what I have.
"Hurry up, or you'll be late."
Do you know where Tom was born?
I want to visit Tom in Boston.
Tom believed what Mary told him.
I didn't find anything better.
I think Tom probably doesn't like you very much.
I have no food.
I asked Tom for help.
Tom wants someone to close the window.
I don't think that anybody suspected that you weren't Tom.
Tom is with friends.
I hope Tom does that on Monday.
The chances that that happens are minimal.
I am ready to follow you.
I'll visit you tomorrow.
Are you lost?
No country on earth is safe in this nuclear age.
We have two television sets.
I just can't help worrying about you.
I think it's unlikely that aliens similar to what we see in the movies have ever visited our planet.
Women like to talk.
Write your address here.
What would you say then?
It's simply too cold today.
I'm not sure that'll happen.
It's against my rules to compromise.
I'm so glad Tom won the race.
I walked around in the field.
I've never been here before.
Stick with me until we get out of the crowd.
Tom persuaded Mary to sell her motorcycle.
Tom was raised by his grandparents.
I assure you that won't be necessary.
Tom is a drunk.
Tom is an experienced skier.
Tom undressed Mary with his eyes.
I think you know we need to hurry.
Don't forget that Tom doesn't understand French.
I'll pass the information to our sales department.
When did you buy this bread?
That's not my question.
Tom helps anyone that asks him for help.
Please fix my toy.
Tom didn't want to go to the dentist's.
When did you work in Boston?
He got lost while walking in the woods.
Tom is hoping we'll do that.
Tom is very worried about the kids.
I meet a lot of people.
Tom is muttering.
It's my life.
Tom has his own apartment.
I've never heard such a thing.
Do you do this every day?
Tom is our best investigator.
I'd rather speak French.
It is getting hotter day by day.
Did Tom say when he'd do that?
You should've called.
I thought Tom said Mary was from Australia.
You have lots of friends.
Tom can teach both French and English.
You may sit down on the chair.
Swear you won't do that again.
I don't intend wait any longer.
I'm not going to open this.
What he needs most is a good job.
Tom says he'll never do it again.
Tom won't listen to us.
I've clean forgotten.
I did it in a hurry.
We're on the right path.
Shouldn't we ask Tom?
I'm awake.
I'm glad you called me.
He can write with either hand.
Are you busy tomorrow afternoon?
I want to talk to your boss.
I'm almost sure.
Are you on a diet?
I'm glad you agreed to see me.
"To tell the truth, I don't agree."
I don't want to die like this.
Nobody swims in this pool after 8:00 p.m.
How would you help?
They'll never know we're here.
We should play by the rules.
I don't know for certain when he will arrive.
Tom comes here almost every weekend.
We don't even know who Tom got married to.
Have you seen all these movies?
Tom knows why Mary agreed to do that.
That hasn't happened yet.
Tom is my son.
Wait for me at the door.
Who taught Tom to drive?
My mother must be angry.
Did Tom get my message?
Tom threw it away.
I don't understand that.
The pirates boarded the ship.
We're all so proud of you.
You'll need a lawyer.
I had no idea Tom didn't know how to speak French.
Would you like some fruit juice?
We aren't on an island.
Tom explained to me in detail how to do that.
I was hungry and thirsty.
"As he grew older, he became more obstinate."
How much longer will we have to wait?
Tom didn't recognize Mary's voice.
Does Tom know about it?
The nurse cared for the patient very tenderly.
I really don't feel well.
Tom unfolded the newspaper and started to read it.
Tom doesn't want to go by train.
I'm not your patient.
This is a bunch of junk.
Tom says he won't vote.
Why do women hate you so much?
Nobody's going to blame you.
He was foolish enough to believe it.
Tom has narrow shoulders.
Where did you get that sweater?
The final score of the game was 3 to 1.
I hope we can go to Boston next summer.
Could you please pull the weeds and water the flowers?
This will make our job a lot easier.
Are you coming back?
Can we get to the beach by bus?
I recognize you.
You put in too much sugar.
I came to the conclusion that I had been deceived.
Why would I ever tell you?
Tom is sound asleep.
"Tom can't stand the hot and muggy summers here, so he heads for the mountains."
We're having hamburgers for lunch.
I'll pay double.
It's eight o'clock at night.
This is a big step forward.
I sometimes play tennis with her.
We're very interested.
Perhaps you are mistaken.
I know that this is important to you.
I think you've been talking about me behind my back.
I don't intend to answer any questions.
Please accept my condolences.
He fell from the tree.
Why's Tom in the kitchen?
How many times do I have to say I'm not married?
The smell was unpleasant.
Where do you have lunch?
He works eight hours a day.
They study in the afternoon.
Tom is very smart.
That's why I'm a bachelor.
Ask if he wants another drink.
How much does he pay for gas each month?
You said we were friends.
Tom should be ready.
Tom is afraid he'll get fired.
I'll stay with you.
They can't see it.
I got sick last week.
You should only believe about half the things Tom says.
How did you obtain this painting?
Tom was very courageous.
Do you think that Tom can win?
"You know her name, don't you?"
Tom left the front door open when he left.
I can't leave Boston.
Tom is no longer afraid.
Are you expecting me to help you?
Do I need to pay in advance?
Does anybody else have a complaint?
Tom won't leave until after lunch.
Tom continued talking.
It's already ten o'clock. My mother must be angry.
That's my father.
I visit my grandparents twice a week.
Do you know what friendship is?
Are you still open?
I can't believe this.
A true friend would have acted differently.
You don't need this.
I thought that you liked Tom.
You are rude.
What're you talking about?
I can't help.
The Colonel said the situation is under control.
Tom knows I'm waiting.
How often do you visit Boston?
I must agree with you on this.
Tom is on another phone.
He still writes poems.
I think that that's wrong.
Why did you leave Tom alone?
My father lives in the country.
Do it delicately.
Let us go home.
You said that you were planning on going with us.
My father is leaving for the United States next Thursday.
Tom wasn't very lucky.
That boy is intelligent.
I've already waited two hours. I can't wait any longer.
Tom has seen this.
"The boy opened the window, although his mother told him not to."
The smell was offensive.
Are you using the default settings?
The orchestra started to play.
This is a gift for Tom.
I think I can learn from my mistakes.
I know you've been avoiding me.
You alone can help me.
Tom thought no one was looking.
"No matter what happens, don't give up."
Let's go and see Tom.
Tom must choose between honor and death.
Don't make me sing.
I don't know where Tom went.
I did that while I was drunk.
"Sooner or later, you'll fall asleep."
My house is your house.
I majored in philosophy at my university.
You can let Tom go.
Tom is lucky to still be alive.
I'll be glad when I'm done.
You have to try again.
The castle is beautiful.
You won't regret it.
She can drive a car.
I can't do anything to help you.
He was kind enough to lend me money.
Just stay where you are and I'll bring you the papers you need to sign.
Can you take Tom to the airport?
The door is closing.
How much money did Tom spend?
Can you do a headstand?
I think Tom was hiding something.
Everything went wrong.
We've got another three days.
You're always saying that.
Where did they come from?
I came too late.
He has no more than 100 dollars.
That's why I brought you here.
Tom sold everything he owned.
I didn't know that Tom could do that.
I wish you hadn't told Tom that.
Tom found some pizza in the refrigerator.
This is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen.
How old are your children?
I can't be fired. I'm the boss's son.
Tell the truth to Tom.
Tom wasn't in a hurry.
I understand.
I can't get my money back.
Just tell me why you're really here.
Tom owns a restaurant on Park Street.
Tom didn't like the taste much.
I want to be a veterinarian.
Tom had to swallow his pride and admit that he needed help.
Why is this room locked?
I will teach you.
We spent more money than was expected.
Does your father know about this?
The ship arrived at the port on schedule.
Tom has only got eyes for Mary.
They were talking together like old pals.
I'll do as you want.
Step away from the car and put your hands on your head.
Tom thinks I'm stupid.
"To succeed in life, you need two things: ignorance and confidence."
I only have eyes for you.
You're lazy.
Taxis are expensive.
I'm sure everything will take a turn for the better.
He urged us to obey the rule.
"OK, I think I get it."
I thought that Tom said that Mary was from Australia.
"This mountain has an altitude of 3,000 meters."
Try this on.
This is not exactly healthy.
I caught a head cold.
I am confused.
Nobody's allowed to do that.
I was disappointed with the results.
I told you it was dangerous.
They waited outside.
He says he will not give up smoking.
Thirteen passengers were hospitalized.
Tom listens to music all day long.
I know that Tom is courageous.
Let me tell you my side of the story.
Tom said he would wait.
I've been so scared.
I didn't forget about you.
Tom has never seen Mary without makeup.
All I had in my pocket was a bus ticket and thirty dollars.
I didn't buy bread.
I don't know how much this motorcycle is.
I will do as you say.
You've got no choice.
Tom wasn't the one who taught Mary how to ride a bicycle.
"Unfortunately, I only understood half of what I read."
Sometimes history repeats itself.
We listened to her for some time.
There is a white dove on the roof.
We're going to Boston tomorrow.
Tom and I don't get along.
Monday was cold.
I'm certain that he'll come.
Tom is putting on weight.
You must think I'm a complete idiot.
"I really, really need to do that."
The barn was destroyed.
You'll feel better now.
Tom wasn't drinking.
I shouldn't have given Tom my phone number.
Tom immediately called 911.
Tom has a lot of great ideas.
Let's forget about this.
Why are you looking at me?
I saw Tom and Mary.
Tom doesn't want to die alone.
You never said anything.
He's greedy and lazy.
I never promised you anything.
Can I begin?
How was Tom murdered?
They're miles away.
Didn't you know that Tom isn't really from Australia?
My daughter went to Britain three years ago.
Tom isn't going to watch TV.
I tried again.
Tom came earlier than usual today.
Can I see the wine list?
All lawyers are liars.
I hope this helps.
The woman you were talking to at that time was my sister.
You call that a marriage?
He made friends with Tom.
Are you satisfied with the result?
It's time to do it.
Tom bought a lot at the edge of town.
I just want to find a cab.
We all know you're smart.
I didn't know Tom was so old.
Why did you call me?
We're upset.
Tom didn't know where to begin.
You should think about your future.
Tom wouldn't allow us to help him.
There's nothing Tom can do to help us.
I can do that for you.
I just had a talk with your teacher.
I haven't told anyone anything.
Tom knew that I wouldn't cry.
Tom had gloves on.
Maybe Tom can't hear us.
Don't you miss Tom?
Did Tom tell you the good news?
Did you tell Tom what to do?
What's Tom up to?
We'll continue the discussion later.
Tom worries too much.
We think too much and feel too little.
Who called 911?
Tom is on the other bus.
I worked as a waiter for three years.
She is a selfish woman.
This is an order.
I have to admit that I'm a bit stingy.
Tom has a bad reputation.
You're overreacting.
I miss that place.
Tom is my only child.
Why do you want to commit suicide?
Didn't you know that was happening?
Tom is having a hard time deciding what to wear to the party.
Can I go now?
The show is over.
Don't bother to call me.
"Tom will go, too, won't he?"
We are cousins.
You don't understand how worried I was about you.
I don't want to eat lunch now.
I'd like to pay by check.
I am in no mood for joking.
You're twice as old as I am.
Tom has run away from home.
I went to your website.
Don't worry. I can fix it.
Do you have money?
I don't know much else.
Where did Tom buy the flowers?
You deserve this.
I hope it doesn't snow today.
Tom still thinks we're friends.
He came down with a cold.
That is his house.
Are they talking about Tom?
Send Tom in.
I'm Tom's guest.
Didn't you know Tom had relatives in Australia?
Tom and Mary have left.
I'll go with you as far as the station.
Listen to me carefully.
Tom still doesn't know where I live.
We lost our way and did not know what to do.
Tom is the only one who knows what to do.
You have to go to the party.
Just stop that.
What's Tom doing?
Tom died at home.
I'm not intimidated.
Ask for Tom.
Have a little of this cake.
Has anything strange happened?
Safety must come first.
Tom and Mary have been married for almost three years.
Let's schedule a meeting sometime early next week.
Losses were heavy on both sides.
"The phone is ringing. ""I'll get it."""
I figured it out.
You never told me you were a pilot.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
I am afraid that you will get lost.
He was deeply moved by the story.
That's a question that only Tom can answer.
"Do you have the key? ""Yes, I have it."""
What rock have you been hiding under?
I love Korean food.
Which newspaper do you read?
He did not want war.
Tom very seldom agrees with me.
Let's talk about global warming.
I'll do it for free.
Tom's not ready to go.
Tom dictated a letter to his secretary.
Did you propose to Mary?
Are you going to wait for me?
I've always respected my father.
Can you explain what happened?
Didn't you know that Tom needed to do that?
She took care of his wound.
Tom told Mary which book to buy.
I would like to see your mother.
Why are you asking me all these questions?
Why is everything so difficult?
Tom thought that he was going to be busy.
I'll be waiting for you outside.
I'm doing everything I can to help Tom.
I think you should buy yourselves some new clothes.
Did Tom tell you where he got this?
I want to know what's going on here.
Tom knew that Mary was OK.
Where can I buy silk?
None of these cars are mine.
Don't turn off your computer.
"Odd, isn't it? We should have already arrived."
I'll see Tom around.
Tom told me Mary was very hungry.
We work in a factory.
Don't play dumb!
I wonder how much it costs.
Tom showed me where he found it.
I warned you about Tom.
I got everything I wanted.
That's an interesting movie.
I didn't ask whether Tom was planning to do that or not.
That was really important.
It cost 30 million dollars.
"If you've got a problem, I'd like to know what it is."
Where are Tom's gloves?
"Tom looked into the classroom, but he didn't see Mary."
I can't stay home today.
May I park here for a while?
These facts prove that he is innocent.
Tom deserves to know.
You look like you're sad.
I hate making decisions.
Can you really see the future?
Tom is in the next room trying to get some sleep.
I got on the horse.
I wish you hadn't come.
I'm exhausted.
What do you usually do in your free time?
Are you on Facebook?
Tom said that Mary was attentive.
I love you and I'll always love you.
Your room is really clean.
I said ignore it.
Nobody believed you.
I could have been killed.
How do you want me to help?
Please adjust the television picture.
I had my bicycle fixed by my brother.
Tom's bluffing.
Give me an orange.
He has a beard.
Tom yanked off John's fake beard.
I knew Tom would forgive me.
Please stop singing that song.
Are you going to Boston tomorrow?
It must be hard for you.
Tom was killed by wild animals.
I make a mean margarita.
Don't you want to hear my side of the story?
I didn't go to Boston last week.
Tom started apologizing.
I think we should go back to Boston.
There are a lot of dishes on the table.
Tom opened the trunk and took out the spare tire.
I don't think you should do it.
Is Tom learning French?
Are you unwell?
May God bless you.
Can you lend me your bicycle?
This umbrella looks like mine.
What's in the bag?
Have they gone?
Won't you come in for a minute?
I can't do that job.
I must talk to Tom.
Do you have the book?
I'm unable to do it.
Tom fell off a ladder and broke both of his arms.
We'll do that ourselves.
You're still young.
Please hold this bag.
I'm on sick leave.
Birds have wings.
I had never seen that kind of fish until then.
Tom is a few inches taller than Mary.
I'm worried that Tom won't like my parents.
What did they say?
Tom asked Mary why she'd been arrested.
Don't lie. Be honest.
"If you could tell me when Tom will arrive, I'll go to the station and pick him up."
Where's the park?
I thought Tom was going to die.
Give me a second.
Don't bother to deny it.
Who exactly is Tom?
I'm going to go home now.
I don't speak a word of French.
It's a small school. Everyone knows everyone.
Tell me what you're looking for and I'll help you find it.
I didn't know why Tom was upset.
I want a chamomile tea.
I didn't know what to believe.
I hit him good and hard.
Tom needs attention.
Which one will he choose?
I hope I can help you.
I wonder what Tom really meant.
None of Tom's friends knew where he lived.
I'm not going to tell you my name.
How did you know that I was Canadian?
It took me only three hours to do that.
Fresh vegetables are very expensive in the winter.
He went there in person.
Why were you here?
Sit down and talk to me.
Tell Tom I'll be there as soon as I can.
Are you sure Tom can do this?
I want to talk with you.
My husband is a good man.
I was just scared.
I know this is stupid.
How did you know that Tom was the one who did that?
Are you sure this is a good idea?
I need a miracle.
The game is over.
Tom is married to a very pretty girl.
"Did you hear what I said, Tom?"
Why did Tom do it?
"Tom accused Mary of stealing his money, but she denied it."
I guess you don't need my help.
Do what you believe is right.
Tom has made his choice.
Tom realized something.
I go as often as I can.
That's not a hard thing to do.
My car got stuck in the mud.
Is she your sister?
She gave birth to twins a week ago.
I'm not done.
I understood what you meant.
He is the same age as me.
"If you didn't put this here, then who did?"
Things just haven't been the same since you left.
"You got drunk, didn't you?"
I have exactly what you need.
We went to the shoe store.
I'm a little homesick.
Dinosaurs became extinct a very long time ago.
Tom works in Silicon Valley.
What were you just doing?
What was his name?
I saw it on Discovery Channel.
"Are you ready, Tom?"
Tom wants to go job hunting.
No one has seen Tom for years.
"You did that, didn't you?"
Tom arrived on Monday.
Tom's skiing.
Do you want to learn how to play the xylophone?
I didn't realize it was a secret.
Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans.
I hope you know that.
Should I tell Tom it's an emergency?
I don't want to be your wife.
Tom was carrying two suitcases.
"Tom is rich, but not me."
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
I was tired and cold.
Are you going for a walk?
Why did you sell your car?
I was trying to protect you.
Do you want a cup of coffee?
Let me give you a ride home.
Tom receives a high salary.
I am happy.
I love you like a son.
The muddy road has ruined my new shoes.
There's no risk.
We know.
Why don't you leave Tom?
Which is the platform for the train to Boston?
I can't do this myself.
Tom has been studying French.
I wanted to make a good first impression.
We'll put you on the list.
Tom and Mary are having a conversation.
I know why Tom didn't want to dance.
We have to be patient.
I'm glad you were here.
Isn’t love supposed to last forever?
Tom couldn't afford a lawyer.
He hasn't made it yet.
You've got an hour.
Please take care of it.
We have a car.
They sang Hawaiian songs.
This custom should be done away with.
You don't have to read the whole thing from beginning to end.
I slept on the train.
Who are you to decide?
That'll never work.
She witnessed the crime.
They close the door at five.
Tom and I walked home together.
Tom is unlikely to wait.
She studies hard.
I'm too depressed to eat.
My son is now as tall as I am.
"Maybe that's true, but it's irrelevant."
Don't forget to shut the doors before going out.
What stopped Tom?
I don't know a thing about running a business.
We had to go there together.
Tom wanted to talk to you.
Let me ask you another question.
The list is growing.
Tom must be hungry.
Can you confirm that?
Don't you understand what's happening?
"If Tom is happy, I'm happy."
Tom didn't want to go outside.
I'm busy again.
Tom didn't admit anything.
Don't be a stranger.
My son likes books about animals.
I wish I had a twin.
They burned themselves.
The desk drawer is open.
All of this is perfectly normal.
Tom didn't leave his apartment.
Tom's car broke down.
I just wanted to know what time Tom would arrive.
Tom took the children to the park.
I never leave home without it.
It was a secret.
Tom ate one apple and Mary ate the other.
Let's try to do that together.
That is simply not true.
Tom says he was hungry.
We'll be forgiven.
Anything that can go wrong will.
My wife died three years ago.
Tom asked me how to cook trout.
That's what my mom keeps telling me.
I have a clear memory of my childhood.
I hope Tom won't frighten Mary.
I think you're completely right.
If you need an umbrella I'll lend you one.
Don't use too much pepper.
Tom is a bit of a nitpicker.
You're not helping me.
You can see it with the naked eye.
Do you think I'm insane?
You didn't tell me everything.
I love Tom more than anything.
I'll sit with Tom.
Are you saying this doesn't matter?
Didn't you know Tom and Mary were planning to get married?
Tom was distracted by Mary.
The magic is gone.
I had almost finished my work when she came.
Tom squealed with laughter.
Make yourself comfortable.
He was buried alive.
Is there something you want to buy?
She is very sensitive to criticism.
I used to do that almost every day.
Tom knows why Mary laughed.
Tom must be very hungry.
My kid was in the car.
Tom began to learn French about three years ago.
Your birthday is the same as mine.
Tom and Mary said they didn't want to fight.
It became quiet again in the forest.
Leave the key.
I didn't know Tom had a brother.
We were outside.
How likely is this to happen again?
I don't need your advice.
Do you want to go someplace?
Cats' eyes are very sensitive to light.
I'm likely to sleep until noon.
You're too aggressive.
When will Tom go to Australia?
When are you planning to tell Tom?
Nobody can open the door.
They caught a bear alive.
I won't budge.
I smiled.
When are we going to play their team?
Why thank me?
I'm almost sure.
We have a website.
I'm sick of hearing it.
I'm no longer afraid.
The police found gunshot residue on Tom's hands.
Will this work?
It's a serious question.
Tom helped Mary move the furniture.
I think I know who did that.
I can't ignore it anymore.
You're my friend.
Tom drove to the supermarket to buy some milk and eggs.
This relationship between Portugal and the United States is still maintained today.
She is afraid of cats.
"Unfortunately, that didn't happen."
I want to buy a gift for you.
How often do you go there?
I won't talk to Tom.
Did you come here by car?
I warned him not to be late.
You can't learn a language without making mistakes.
Tom apparently lost his passport.
Every problem can be solved.
That wouldn't happen.
Tom chuckled when he heard Mary's joke.
I'm going to close the door now.
She never wears pants.
"Soon, we'll know why."
Tom is disappointed.
I was hoping you'd ask.
Have you ever been fingerprinted?
Tom asked me where Mary worked.
Did Tom tell you about the party tonight?
Don't do this.
Tom doesn't live on Park Street anymore.
Where do you think I can find Tom?
How many do you want?
We have to pull the weeds.
What a charming couple!
She has two thousand books.
There's nowhere else to go.
What's your favorite band?
I haven't told Tom what to do yet.
This doesn't count.
A new difficulty presented itself.
We'll finish later.
I knew that Tom wouldn't do that.
Tom took out his camera.
Tom is going to have a busy weekend.
They marched in support of the government.
You didn't tell me you worked for Tom.
They have assigned me a small room.
The trouble is that we have nowhere to stay tonight.
Our fate is in your hands.
This is fun.
Who did you buy those flowers for?
I wasn't afraid.
I expect to stay in Boston a day or so.
I'd love to talk to you.
"If I were you, I'd go home."
I don't know any of her students.
Tom came in second in the race.
We have to rent a room to hold the party in.
How do you do that?
Just wait here.
Have you seen my glasses anywhere?
Now's the perfect time to do that.
Did you know that Tom would be there?
He is suffering from toothache.
Did she show you the picture?
Why won't they release Tom?
That doesn't even make sense.
"If I'd left earlier, I wouldn't have missed the train."
I don't know what I'm going to do next.
You're driving too fast.
I said I'd look after you.
I should probably apologize to Tom.
Why don't you tell us about it?
You don't have to tell me.
The story ends with his death.
You can't stop me.
He expressed regret over the affair.
I didn't know that Tom had three cats.
Think of your future.
Do you know that person?
Will you be in Boston for a while?
Tom is the only adult in the room.
I'm bad at sports.
"I have a test today, too."
They abandoned the ship.
I don't want to sit next to Tom.
Which way is the beach?
Tom and Mary are already there.
We knew you'd come.
Tom volunteered to go to Boston.
Everyone pronounces Tom's name wrong.
Are you still at home?
Tom has a son who's a doctor.
Tom made a lot of money last year.
Tom couldn't wait.
I know that Tom is alone.
The bomb caused a lot of damage when it exploded.
I can't do this without you.
Do you feel better?
Are you still upset?
Tom is just pretending he can't understand French.
Tom bought an engagement ring for Mary with money he inherited from his grandfather.
That's a total lie.
You seem very nervous.
There was something moving in the distance.
I don't remember saying that.
Please be brief.
We will be happy to cooperate.
Please don't be nervous.
I write in my diary every day.
Tom and I have the same color eyes.
Let's go bowling together sometime soon.
I was helping Tom.
"Hey, you! What are you doing?"
Tom told me that Mary wasn't his type.
You tried.
I'll assist you.
"Tom likes listening to American English the most, but he also likes the sound of Irish English."
You're the oldest.
I can't even afford to buy a used car.
What makes it so unique?
Have you ever been to Europe?
I think Tom might not win.
I don't think Tom knows where Mary wants to live.
Cut it out.
Do you think the police will ever find out what happened to Tom?
I usually go to bed at nine.
Tom will never be forgiven.
I am well.
Tom isn't at home. He's at work.
They sleep in separate bedrooms even though they're married.
Tom has disappeared.
How much is it?
I bought it for 10 dollars.
Tom is on his way to Australia.
Tom said that he wasn't drunk.
You're the captain.
I'll stay home tonight.
You didn't answer me.
Tom told me to stay at home.
I never forgot you.
I'm not a doctor.
He jumped onto the table.
I'm literate.
How many lifeboats are on this ship?
Tom is hypocritical.
Tom didn't have a hat on.
It's already eleven.
I'm a law student.
I didn't even ask him what his name was.
Why were you there?
Tom wanted to meet me.
Did that work?
Are you still hungry or have you had enough?
This has been a tough week for Tom.
I didn't think you'd be busy.
Do you want me to ask Tom?
That book is written in French.
They thanked God.
Do you like oysters?
That's possible.
She knows the truth.
Are you sick? You look pale.
Why were you angry with me?
Where do you buy your dresses?
Turn to the left.
This is one of the most dangerous places on Earth.
May I speak to Tom?
I didn't ask.
"Will you please wait on me, miss?"
Tom lit the match.
People will laugh at you if you do something as stupid as that.
There are songs that I find degrading as a woman.
Let's conceal this secret from him.
I know Tom was your best friend.
I think it's time for me to study.
The sun is about to set.
How deep is that lake?
I stepped aside so he could pass.
Tom knelt down on one knee.
She took pity on him.
"I'm Irish, but I don't speak Irish."
A man began to follow Tom.
If only Tom could see you now.
He intended to marry her.
Tom saw a ship in the distance.
Tom needed a hammer.
You made it.
Someone stole my passport.
Aren't you late?
Get started.
I thought you'd already left.
What does Tom eat when he's watching TV?
Nobody heard Tom's screams.
Don't erase the board.
The gate was left open.
Do you like to run?
Tom really impressed me.
"This is Tom, my assistant."
I was dizzy.
I didn't ask for your advice.
Tom waited for Mary in front of the school.
Don't you have something better to do?
The door won't close.
There are many foreign tourists in Asakusa.
He did nothing but watch TV all day.
I've already told Tom what I plan to do.
I only have one friend left.
How do I know that you're not going to try to kill me?
I gave my seat to an elderly woman.
We have all the evidence we need.
Where should we go next?
Tom still can't afford it.
I would've said no.
I think you know that that's not true.
I like helping people.
The waiter brought a new plate.
Tom bent over to tie his shoe.
Everyone was so busy.
I hate Halloween.
Did Tom really want Mary to do that?
"I don't want to go without you, Tom."
I'm ready to order.
Are you leaving?
Didn't you know Tom lived in Australia when he was a kid?
I got this CD player for free.
Tom was wearing a black suit yesterday.
The point of the pencil has become dull.
My mom helps me a lot.
Let's discuss what happened to Tom.
Where were you 3 years ago?
Nobody knows Tom like I know Tom.
I don't feel sorry for her.
The cat is in its basket.
What a lot of pens!
Am I the only one who thinks this is weird?
Sorry for being late.
I don't want to go back home yet.
Why are you in my house?
He kept silent for a while.
This is the book I want to read.
Did you know Tom was dating Mary?
I'm sure I'll manage.
It's probably a mistake.
Did you take these pictures in Australia?
Throw me that rope.
You can go if you want.
He walked along the street.
Tom told me you were friends.
He is young.
Tom untied the ribbon.
I don't know whether it's important or not.
I had to come to terms with my present salary.
It's been ten years since I came to Japan.
I knew Tom wouldn't come back.
This cat doesn't chase rats.
The temperature went up to 30 degrees.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
You aren't in any danger.
Tom isn't a criminal.
Tom has betrayed us.
I assure you Tom will be perfectly safe.
That's not fair and you know it.
Do you know something about it?
I'm afraid I won't finish the report on time.
Haven't I met you before?
I laughed out loud.
Tom lowered the bucket into the well.
They're criminals.
Did you just wake up?
Who drew this picture?
Stop spending money on stupid things.
I don't trust anyone anymore.
Do you understand what's happening?
I'll let you go.
I was being ironic.
I'll give you a piece of good advice.
Tom gave Mary a call.
It's warm under the blanket.
That's what I do all day.
I seldom listen to the radio.
"Don't just stand there, say something."
My mother asked me to keep her company during the weekend.
Who let the dog in?
He will arrive on the afternoon of the 5th.
He is more clever than I am.
We have to slow down.
She wants to move out and find a place of her own.
That's asking too much.
I was very busy.
What was Tom doing in your room?
I think it's going to rain.
That's why I lied.
I thought Tom might want it.
Could you give me a ride to the bus stop?
The accused is a legal term.
I think I've found the solution to the problem.
Tom'll go.
Tom said he liked the idea.
Not everyone does that.
I'm used to staying up late at night.
The girls objected to our plan.
We have to study.
Are you sure everyone's already left?
You don't know what it's like to be married to Tom.
"You don't believe them, do you?"
There's no cure for stupidity.
"He is a busy man, so you can only get in touch with him by telephone."
Why is Tom naked?
This doll costs only sixty cents.
Look what I bought.
I hope you bought candles.
What time do you wake up in the morning?
Tom thanked Mary for the present.
It's as I feared.
Are there any objections?
Tom just came.
"You have wanted to go there for a long time, haven't you?"
It's just impossible to do.
I'm glad to hear it.
Tom resigned the next day.
I'm not sure I'm ready for this.
It's all you can really do.
I thought Tom didn't eat meat.
I'm glad you're staying.
You have no right to be here.
Did you know that that would happen?
He did the opposite.
Tom lives with his father in Australia.
We watched a baseball game on television.
Let's wait till next year.
I'm very busy today.
I'm sure Tom will take that into consideration.
Tom hasn't yet read the report you wrote.
We lived in a great big house.
Did you see him go out?
There are no gods.
They're older than Tom.
You are hopeless.
Tom didn't have enough time to finish his homework.
When are you free?
I tried to swim across the river.
I really didn't have any money.
It's a little spooky out here.
I've never seen you here before.
I don't believe Tom would do that.
Do you have a bigger frying pan?
Tom didn't want to study abroad.
Tom is eating the sandwich that you made for him.
May I write it in French?
Mary has two boyfriends.
"I could make you do that, but I won't."
Tom was a very nice man.
I'm a rebel.
I am tired of homework.
You pay for quality.
Tell me what'll happen.
You'll be missed by your friends.
Tom loves spicy food.
I have nothing more to say to Tom.
I don't know anything about racing.
Stop wasting your breath.
A smart dog never barks for no reason.
What have you been up to?
Where can one buy books?
Help me lift it.
We thank you very much!
I don't think that Tom knows his neighbors.
Tom has been wearing the same shirt all week.
Tom put the thermometer on the wall.
I didn't know you were hungry.
I had some bad breaks.
Tom didn't answer Mary.
I think that Tom will go to Australia.
That wasn't your fault.
What you need is a friend.
The only thing I want to do right now is sleep.
Have you ever been to Africa?
I'm busy tonight.
Please explain the rules of football to me.
Tom is going to say yes.
You're going to be famous someday.
Tom sharpened the knives for Mary.
What do you think of Tom?
Tom sat alone at the counter.
I'm not much of a swimmer.
Tom had good reason to worry.
It didn't hurt.
I was the only woman.
I can wait no longer.
Tom married Mary after her husband died.
I don't remember asking for it.
You're with us now.
Are you telling me you can't do that?
I slipped on the ice.
Can I sit down?
I don't think that I'm going to be able to do that.
What've you been doing all morning?
You lean on your parents too much. You must be more independent.
Tell me where you keep your wine.
Would I kid you?
We don't have enough room.
Tom said you were angry.
Tom didn't trust us.
I passed out.
The question is whether Tom will do it or not.
Tom closed the book.
Tom was being blackmailed by Mary.
Who did you think it was?
He devoted his life to education.
How many knives do you need?
Who gave you permission to do that?
Tom is going to be famous someday.
Tom was sure of it.
He actually didn't see the accident.
This isn't an easy task.
I was dancing.
I wanted my money back.
I forgot I was supposed to call you.
Take some aspirin.
I've already told you what to do.
I'm sure that you'll succeed.
I was asked to give you a message.
Somebody's singing.
I like sauerkraut.
Why should Tom apologize to you?
Tom will never leave his wife.
Can you remember how much you paid for this?
"I know what you're thinking, but it's not true."
They set up a fund to support the victims.
Tom very seldom cries.
I didn't permit Tom to do that.
I want you out of here.
Tom wants to try it.
His mother was ashamed of him.
I didn't recognize Tom.
These boxes are made of plastic.
"Now you've come of age, you have the right to vote."
Tom stole Mary's computer.
I know I can count on you.
I don't know the exact length of this bridge.
Tom doesn't do anything.
What did Tom show you?
"If your tongue turns black, you should probably see a doctor."
Tom gave me everything I asked for.
Tom died from cancer in 2013.
Can you trust Tom?
I do not understand the exact meaning of this sentence.
I thought Tom didn't understand French.
Tom is getting off the plane.
Where can Tom be?
Tom and I have to stick together.
I said I wasn't hungry.
Stop crying.
I already did it.
I want you to join us.
Any child could do that.
"Daddy, let's have a staring contest."
There is no fire without smoke.
Please don't distract me from my work.
I laughed aloud.
Do you believe global warming is the result of human actions?
I don't know what to tell Tom.
Where do you buy your dresses?
What's in the box is none of your business.
Tom lives in the same apartment building as Mary does.
Tom underwent surgery.
Let me go!
I think you could do that.
Don't try to speak.
Lean in closer.
Tom has been ignoring Mary.
He asks me to be attentive.
I just can't do that.
What will the trip cost?
Did you sleep enough last night?
He is a simple man.
"Whether you like it or not, you have to go."
I'll tell you a story.
A lot of countries participated in the Olympic Games.
Let's go to your apartment.
We've been waiting for you for an hour.
Is Tom still angry?
Tom has access to the information we need.
Are you trying to distract me?
I wish I could tell you.
I'd like to be called Tom.
Follow him.
Getting rid of bad habits is hard.
That decision was easy to make.
Tom waited for Mary in the lobby.
I think it's time for me to lose some weight.
I'm not used to hard work.
Tom is divorced and has a daughter.
You're wrong about Tom.
Tom is going to go to Boston next weekend.
"Although her house is nearby, I seldom see her."
I promised Tom I'd do that today.
Tom is a lot like Mary.
Tom believes the system is broken.
Tom will be proud of you.
You still haven't told me why you're here.
Please speak more quickly.
It happened just the way you predicted.
Tom found one.
Did you see anything else?
I think nobody's home.
You're not alone.
Tom spent the whole evening searching the Web for photos of famous people.
I gave my father a silk tie.
When did you eat?
Don't lock the door.
Tom is working full time.
I have several Canadian friends.
She's a supermodel.
I knew Tom wasn't Mary's brother.
We all know who they are.
Are you on vacation?
Tom said we can stay.
Tom may have seen it.
I'm the one who has to do this.
Everyone in my family can play a musical instrument.
I have to get some new clothes.
They know us.
Tom has a high opinion of himself.
Tom heard a loud noise.
The meeting was called off.
The food isn't very good here.
You were never good at math.
I've known Tom longer than I've known you.
Didn't you know I used to teach French in Australia?
Drink it while it's hot.
I know I'm doing the right thing.
It's still not working.
Anything will help.
You need to give this to Tom personally.
We're not alone.
I didn't mean to startle you.
Do you need them?
I've known Tom for almost ten years.
The deadline is 2:30 on Monday.
Tom's jaw dropped.
Tom died in a fire.
She is famous as a singer.
I used to play here when I was a child.
I could've met you at the airport.
I play tennis after school.
Tom doesn't want to get in trouble.
"If you say that to Tom, you'll run the risk of losing your job."
Your stupid remark just added fuel to the flames.
We need lumber to build a barn.
Don't eat garbage.
Today is the first day of spring.
Where do I throw these eggshells?
He's a real man.
She altered her plans.
"I'm trying to help Tom, but he won't let me."
Let's play poker.
My husband is a compulsive gambler. What can I do?
Tom doesn't know where Mary used to live.
What can you give me?
I'm for that.
I don't understand him sometimes.
Tom stayed home with Mary.
Do you want some peaches?
When is Tom going back to Boston?
Those chairs are made from wood.
Keep going straight through the village.
What time does the store open?
He put on his glasses and began to read.
It's my fault. I wasn't paying attention.
That's not what I told you.
She is a doctor.
I see Tom frequently.
I think that Tom will love this book.
Tom turned off the alarm.
The majority is often wrong.
Tom got angry with the high school students.
Why didn't you tell me the truth?
I know that you'll love Boston.
Have you sold it yet?
Was Tom the one who told you I was here?
I don't believe anything Tom said.
You're talkative.
Don't overdo it.
Tom's old car has finally given up the ghost.
Tom and I were worried.
Start singing.
Tom was completely helpless.
Now I know better.
I've won three times.
There are no classes today.
We took him to the hospital.
Tom didn't seem surprised when I told him why I did that.
Have you seen my jacket?
Why are we still here?
I was in prison for three years.
I've been studying French since I was thirteen.
Tom is puzzled.
I don't understand what you want to do.
I'm trying to concentrate.
"You haven't told anyone else, have you?"
We're not that desperate.
Tom adores you.
Where can I get my suit pressed?
I was hoping I would be out of the hospital before ski season started.
Someone stole my dartboard.
We have 13 grandchildren.
Just find Tom.
Who owns that house?
How much do eggs sell for?
The picnic was canceled because of rain.
Tom went to a Catholic school.
Do you drink beer or wine?
I don't want you to be disappointed in me.
Tom was in jail at the time.
Tom needs to go away.
"He's young, naive and inexperienced."
Tom said he needs to find another way to make money.
I don't want any popcorn.
Tom is afraid to go outside.
Do you still sing with Tom?
I'm sure Tom doesn't want to be here.
Don't you trust Tom?
Get us out of here.
I still have work to do.
Tom felt really bad about what had happened.
Don't you remember what I said?
Did you have a nice weekend?
How many centimeters are there in a meter?
I think you're ready.
I'm reading a book on American history.
Tom paid for it in a lump sum.
She's very emotional.
Mary is a charming woman.
She was alone on Valentine's Day.
How much do you owe me?
I want to hear your version of what happened.
Give me a little more.
"Do you need me, Tom?"
Don't dwell on your past mistakes!
Tom is really popular.
It's hard to choose.
Tom doesn't want Mary there.
We'll see you next Monday.
I feel sorry.
I guess I should've done this earlier.
Tom is wearing headphones.
He always works a lot.
What's your doctor's name?
Tom is going inside.
I think it's disgusting.
Tom said that was OK.
Do you have a book?
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
Tom didn't come to rescue Mary.
I always get up at 7:30.
Do you think Tom and I are blind?
I go there on Monday.
What do you call this animal in French?
Don't you think it's really hard?
Which one would you take?
Are you sure you don't want to go swimming with us?
I have a guest.
We've made far too many mistakes.
What's your niece's name?
"The doctor told you to stay in bed until your fever goes down, didn't he?"
I'm really happy I did that.
What are the symptoms of meningitis?
Tom wouldn't care.
This is where Tom wants to live.
Tom is hard to live with.
Have you found a job yet?
You can trust all of us.
Show me your hands.
Tom could stop this.
I've already told you not to do that.
This one is full.
I heard that before.
Do you think I'm fat?
Tell Tom yourself.
That couldn't be helped.
Why are you so sad today?
I know you can help us.
Tom told me he'd help me.
I had an awful day.
I knew I could win.
No problem.
Tom is taking a bath.
You can see how much difference a few degrees can make.
"Who is younger, Tom or Mary?"
What'll tomorrow's weather be like?
Tom searched every nook and cranny of the house looking for his wallet.
We can't do that without you.
I didn't know that you would do that.
I congratulate you on your success.
Tom said you were good at chess.
Is that Tom's bedroom?
I have a lot of gardening to do.
You've lost the ability to concentrate.
The experts decided the document was a forgery.
Tom didn't need to leave.
We have three adopted children. The younger two are biological brothers.
I've got one for you.
I don't see any reason why you can't come with us.
I don't want to interrupt Tom.
I plan to go to France next year.
They gave us one last chance.
I am buying candy and cookies.
I want to tell Mary I love her.
I had no idea that Tom knew so much about zebras.
Guess what I want to talk about.
Tom doesn't know how to dance.
Tom said that he'd help.
I want to give you a gift.
Open this door.
I want you to listen to me very carefully.
Tom has traveled all over Europe.
Your friends will miss you.
Don't you think that's a bit weird?
Tom and Mary spent the day at the beach.
Give me your address.
What's happening outside?
Even the dog ran away.
Tom said that he hoped he'd be able to help us.
You did that on purpose.
I can't believe that didn't work.
I turned the handle.
I wonder if Tom would really do something like that.
Did it surprise you?
Aren't you a taxi driver?
Did Tom forgive you?
I think that you are right.
We need to be prepared for the worst.
I ran.
What is the matter with you?
I like your cats.
The museum took down the picture of the royal family.
There's a lot to see in Paris.
I'm turning off the light.
"Tom, you look very sleepy."
This is really nice!
Tom told me which book I should buy.
Tom chased the cats away.
"OK, that's enough for today."
Are you with someone?
Is there time?
He expressed himself very well in English.
Both Tom and I can't swim.
She wanted me to come.
I'm not sure what I should do.
I would like to go to Austria to study music.
Let's walk.
Tom knows Mary is with John.
How do I get to Park Street?
I'll be waiting for you.
I'm afraid you misunderstood me.
They're eager to see you.
Mom bought a pretty doll for me.
This is for your own good.
The only person Tom knows in Boston is Mary.
Is it difficult to learn French?
You should probably speak a little bit slower.
I knew Tom would say no.
You have no authority to do that.
Everyone thinks we're a couple.
I'm the only one who's done that.
I don't like celery.
Thank you for taking the time to talk to us.
My father used to eat at this restaurant.
Tom hated spinach.
He sells whisky.
Tom took some coins out of his pocket.
Who could've foreseen it?
Tom may have known the answer.
Why are you following us?
He has two aunts on his mother's side.
"I wanted to help you, but Tom told me not to."
I'm not going to deny that.
Tom wasn't at all upset.
I highly doubt that.
What did you do last summer?
My knee hurts.
This is Tom's diary.
He's always bad-mouthing his wife.
I didn't go there myself. I sent Tom.
Stop crying.
The ship from New York will arrive before long.
Tom has a good job now.
I write to Tom two or three times a week.
All my friends like Tom.
I thought that was what you wanted.
I have a long way to go.
Tom said that it looked like Mary was getting drowsy.
I know how hard that is.
Let them know we're happy.
"If I had one million yen now, I would buy a car."
He raised his hand to stop the taxi.
Tom picked some flowers for Mary.
Tom never says hello.
I don't believe a word of what people have been saying about her.
You must've known.
I'm paying a lot of taxes.
Why was the train late?
What else do you have in your pocket?
I don't want to look stupid.
You should keep it secret.
That company is managed by my older brother.
I want to be a police officer.
Tom could retire if he wanted to.
Nothing has changed.
She has seven sons.
You swim quite well.
This is where we live.
Is Tom really leaving?
Tom expressed his condolences.
Let me come in.
I can't share that information with you.
I don't want your job.
Don't take it wrong.
Rugs absorb sound.
You should've come.
Tom now has his own room.
I'm not even sure if Tom will come.
Tom has apparently not yet left.
You shouldn't get married.
That's my destiny.
You're too young to get married.
That chef prepares different meals every day.
Somebody saw you.
Tom said he wants to go.
Tom is on good terms with his classmates.
Tom called me a cab.
Tom gave his cat to Mary.
I don't want to tell my boyfriend.
What's the last thing that you remember?
Tom wants to spend more time with his family.
You don't have to talk.
She gave birth on Monday to her first child.
What do you usually do on Friday night?
Tom is the best father I know.
I don't like this song.
Tom earned money by playing his guitar on street corners.
Who told you that I was sick?
I was in Boston most of the summer.
Tom has nothing better to do.
I think he is holding something back from us.
Does every boy have to learn cooking in your school?
Did you manage to sleep?
Tom asked me why I wouldn't go.
It'll be a long time before I can afford to buy a house.
I looked for him in the supermarket.
Let me help you with that.
Tom doesn't know his neighbors.
The knife is not sharp.
You may speak freely.
I'll never do that again.
I changed my profile picture.
I don't know how to play the flute.
Tom has been in the hospital for a few months.
All of this is because of you.
I don't know whether Tom will eat with us or not.
Tom sneezes a lot.
Do you really want to help?
It's a personal matter.
He's always complaining about the food.
Tom outsmarted me.
How many years did it take you to do that?
Tom has a gun.
I've got nothing else to do.
I thought that I saw a ghost.
What would you do if the world was going to end tomorrow?
I confessed.
"Since it's cold outside, you'd better put your overcoat on."
Tom told me he didn't want to go to Australia.
Do you think Tom will be here tomorrow?
He soon walked away.
How was I supposed to know?
You look tired.
"May I have a glass of milk, please?"
I love watching TV.
I don't think Tom is serious.
Could you buy everything you needed?
Is Tom a suspect?
Tom managed to put out the fire.
The meeting has been postponed.
Was that necessary?
How can we avoid that problem?
Ignorance is no excuse.
Is Tom lying?
Tom doesn't have a son.
Tom might be right.
"I tried, but I didn't succeed."
Tom doesn't like sitting next to Mary.
I'd like to see you before I leave for Europe.
Why don't you want to go first?
I'll pick him up at 5.
Bright ideas never occur to me.
You've lost a lot of blood.
You'll have to ask someone else.
Are you sure you don't want me to talk to Tom?
There's something for you on the table.
Everyone calls me Tom.
Tom has brought presents for all of us.
Do what you will.
They changed the system.
Why pay when you can get it for free?
I don't know the person you're talking about.
You fainted.
Do you have a doctor or nurse in this hotel?
Don't you want to help them?
I couldn't leave Tom.
What do you intend to do?
I don't know. What do you think?
We'll discuss that later.
We're not geniuses.
Something is happening.
Tom still doesn't know what Mary did.
I gave her her dictionary back.
I shouldn't have left you alone.
Will you pass me the salt?
"If you go out so lightly dressed, you'll catch a cold."
We were working hard on the project.
I flew from Boston to Chicago.
He gave me a half dozen linen handkerchiefs.
I'm going back home.
Tom told me he was mistaken.
This watch needs to be repaired.
I can't tell you what I'm going to do.
I'm pleased you're here.
We'll accept your conditions.
Why are you waiting here?
I understand now.
Can you tell me what the temperature is down there at the moment?
Tom told me to answer your questions.
He is the father of three children.
He looks gloomy.
Tom likes olives.
I love soul food.
Tom is waiting for Mary to arrive.
Nobody likes her.
I didn't know that it would be impossible to do that.
I want to go there by myself.
You have to do it properly.
His body was covered with brown fur.
I know that now.
Please explain how this works.
Tom became sick from eating bad food.
Come closer to me.
I didn't see who came.
He likes sweet tea.
I'm not feeling very well myself.
Tom isn't the only one who thinks so.
I don't think I can do this alone.
Tom grew up thinking that he needed to eat meat every day.
I won the bet.
Are you ever late for class?
Are you losing weight?
I'm staying at this hotel.
You were treated unfairly.
Do you think Tom did this?
I know your face.
It'll be dark by the time we get to Boston.
Nothing will help.
Here's my chance.
I don't know how.
Tom can leave now if he wants to.
We debated the problem.
What more do I need to know?
He made up his mind to try again.
What's your favorite soap opera?
Everybody was surprised.
I locked myself in the bathroom.
I have done a good job.
"She cried and cried, but nobody came to comfort her."
I thought Tom wouldn't win.
Tom looked great.
He isn't Tom.
They were right.
Let's begin our work at once.
Tom works in Boston.
They entered the forest.
Tom will never go there alone.
I will never forget your kindness.
We're lost.
I want you back.
Try to understand this.
The cancer had spread to several organs.
Can Tom come to Boston with you?
I want you to go easy on Tom.
How could you say something like that?
Why aren't they back?
Tom isn't going to give an inch.
I just had a talk with your teacher.
I heard what you said.
Tom is an excellent cricket player.
Don't say anything now.
I really need a job.
Our teacher looks very young.
When did you first notice you were being followed?
I don't have a choice. I have to do it.
I have to be home for dinner.
Tom is behind you.
The truth is that I don't know anything about it.
Which one is broken?
How many times have you moved?
Mary looks very pretty today.
Where did you find such an ugly hat?
I don't know anybody here.
It's not too early.
Everyone does what he can.
Does it taste good?
What time does it close?
How did that end?
It goes without saying that autumn is the best season for study.
I wanted Tom to confess.
Please leave.
He will come tomorrow.
What sort of yogurt do you like best?
Tom is just tired.
How did you guess that?
Tom hired a private detective.
Tom has to listen to Mary.
This is my best friend.
How did you learn how to do this?
Does Tom know that you know?
The door was locked and we couldn't get in.
The doctor gave Tom a sedative.
I've already told everyone that I'm moving to Boston.
Can you advise me?
He finally bent to my wishes.
What a beautiful sweater!
How long did the surgery take?
Can we sit in the back?
That must be Tom's girlfriend.
I always knew you'd be back.
I want to see Tom first.
Which one do you like most?
Cows are eating grass in the meadow.
Tom dreaded having to spend Christmas in the hospital.
Tom prefers to eat french fries with ketchup.
I can do everything myself.
Would I be able to do that?
I told Tom I wanted him to help me.
I called my mother.
Tom isn't very talkative.
Thank you for this wonderful gift.
Don't be so reserved.
Tom wants to become a diplomat.
You're absolutely right about that.
Please put a cassette in the VCR and press the record button.
I don't think I need a coat today.
I explained the rules to Tom.
The captain controls the whole ship.
"Of course, I remember you."
We know Tom did that.
Tom got to know Mary's friends.
I lived in Boston for years.
Let's not exaggerate the facts.
I don't think that Tom will want to go with us.
I couldn't remember their names.
I'm inviting you.
"Do you drink coffee? If so, how many cups of coffee do you drink every day?"
Buy Tom a drink.
What will your wife think?
I wonder why Tom won't talk to me anymore.
I can hear you.
Why do you make everything so complicated?
Tom put it in the box.
Is Tom in the hospital?
How is this pronounced?
Lightning normally accompanies thunder.
Let's vote.
I didn't say a word.
I hope that I don't get kicked off the team.
Let me know what you think.
Tom is making breakfast.
I'm reformed.
I think that Tom would say yes.
I know how old Tom is.
I was profoundly disturbed by this news.
Tom is hard to deal with.
How do you know so much about it?
My brother is a vet.
You better sleep.
I forgot I was supposed to call you.
Do you know when Mozart died?
Tom didn't drink very much.
I need that information as soon as possible.
Tom and Mary both saw you.
One is missing.
I'm thirsty.
I'm a bit drunk.
It will cost you more to go by plane.
I'm not going to abandon you.
I'm happy enough.
My headache is beginning to go away.
Tom said he'll be leaving tomorrow.
I'll find somebody.
Do you think that's going to help?
The performing seals come on next.
This is Tom.
"Tom didn't want to go, but he did."
It was time for breakfast.
I want you to be proud of me.
It was found at the bottom of the river.
I needed some more time.
I'd like to tell Tom that I love him.
I'll do the dishes.
I need to lose a few kilos.
I'd like to go to Australia sometime.
You may park here.
I wish you didn't live so far away.
What if the scheme doesn't work out?
Tom felt hungry.
Don't let anyone open this door.
I'm looking for a way out.
I didn't go there.
I don't want to go.
"This blackboard is not black, but green."
He's a big boy.
Tom has a new car.
We're leaving in five minutes.
Both of us want to do that.
She told him a joke.
I'm a preschool teacher.
Tell me what my choices are.
I didn't know that you were so old.
I need to tell you something.
Everyone knows you did that.
I'm pretty sure the first thing you'll want to do when you get to Boston is call home.
I hope you tore up my last letter.
That's my specialty.
"Hello, I'm Tom."
"If Tom were here, what would you say to him?"
Let's not get crazy.
I don't think Tom has time today to help you.
Tom doesn't know what we did.
We're pleased with the result.
Do you mind if I go?
He was having lunch when I entered the room.
This is so sad.
I think that this is ridiculous.
I didn't know that you owned a truck.
"You know who I'm talking about, right?"
I thought Tom was from Boston.
This book is meant for children.
I'd like to see you again.
I know I've let you down.
Let me in.
Tom left within a few months.
We believe in you.
Come with us.
He can swim.
You should apologize to Tom for coming late.
He looks exactly like his brother.
Tom is leaving for Australia next week.
Tom has a problem.
I won't need it.
I don't want any money.
I was afraid to speak.
I don't think it's up to you to decide.
That's why you're still single.
Let me look.
Do you really think that'll work?
Do you have brothers and sisters?
Give me an example. I don't understand.
I'm sure Tom will be skeptical.
We didn't want to worry you.
I've always been a dreamer.
He's not quite satisfied.
I know that Tom is still busy.
I asked Tom where he'd been.
Fresh fruits and vegetables are good for you.
Did you lie to your parents?
I'll try.
Hold that thought.
Tom is still in Australia.
What did you get for Christmas this year?
Don't you think it's a little too big?
We were so afraid.
How much longer is it going to take?
Do you know how to do this?
None of them are drivers.
I know what Tom means.
I'm not nervous.
Are all these books yours?
I don't smoke anymore.
We're not too far from Boston.
You can give Tom mine.
Do you like pears?
I met with Tom today.
You ought to smile more often.
Tom has finally stopped crying.
"Don't drink too much, okay?"
Tom had nothing to add.
I have just a few questions.
I'm going crazy.
I'm coming to save you.
Bring me the dictionary.
You're not always right.
I was caught in a shower and got wet to the skin.
I used to like you a lot.
That'll cost you extra.

I just can't get along with Tom.
We're being called.
Scientists have found water on Mars.
What's Tom doing in Mary's office?
Your friend is here.
She needs you.
You'll be the first to know.
"You've been paid, haven't you?"
Tom hit the ball so hard he split the bat.
Ask Tom if Mary will come with us or not.
Do you have a pain reliever?
I'm not much of a cook.
I wanted to rescue you.
I like this club.
You're vain.
"What's the matter, dear?"
I want you to ride with Tom.
Do you think Tom believed what you told him?
Keep it warm.
I didn't find it funny at all.
Artificial light is produced by means of electricity.
Did I scare you?
Don't tell me you didn't bring it.
I admit I'm wrong.
Can you tell me the time?
I might ask the same question again.
I built a treehouse with Tom.
I called Tom stupid.
His father is a physicist.
I'll ask Tom to get you something to eat.
Try to remember.
Tom should've known this.
We have to get up early tomorrow.
I find you very attractive.
I'm going away for a few days.
Tom seems out of sorts.
The baby was sleeping soundly in his mother's arms.
It's dangerous to climb this mountain.
Tom wants to end this.
We didn't complain.
Let's go again.
Everyone knows we didn't do that.
"When I arrived at the station, the train was just about to leave."
Farm prices had fallen fifty-five percent.
That hurts.
I think you knew my father.
The streets in Hokkaido are wide.
Is it worse than before?
That's your idea.
It was almost noon when I woke up.
"You know Tom, don't you?"
He's not all there.
Tom only drinks water.
It's better to be born lucky than to be born rich.
School begins at half past eight.
Tom had to go.
Tom needs to go.
Tom tried to help Mary up.
How do you like them apples?
Tom doesn't like being the center of attention.
Do you play baseball?
Tom isn't likely to notice the difference.
She managed to carry all the bags herself.
I could see Tom was still alive.
I'm Tom's stepbrother.
Would I lie to you?
Tom's car is blue.
Why did Tom kill himself?
Tom ate the orange without peeling it first.
That word is very difficult to translate.
Tom and Mary are rivals.
We have wine.
Tom doesn't play tennis very well.
I was weak.
I waited three hours.
I don't like doing that.
The school year is over.
Tom has broken his left leg.
I have gained weight.
I asked why.
What do you really think?
Tom should've drunk more water.
I have something to talk to you about.
"Tom was thirsty, so he drank a glass of water."
Tom is the oldest of the three brothers.
I have a large house.
Didn't you know you didn't need to do that?
I found it there.
Please be sure to turn off the light before you leave.
Do you know how dangerous that is?
It makes no sense at all.
We chose Tom to be captain.
I said I'd do it.
I want that one.
You're good at this.
Were you at home all morning?
The value of the dollar is going up.
Is it clean?
He is a soccer player.
Someone called on her yesterday.
When's your bedtime?
"Brr, it's cold."
I can ride a bike.
I don't see any reason to complain.
Drop your gun!
They're still not safe.
You are prohibited from smoking here.
"Unfortunately, it's a hoax."
Go sleep in your own room.
Do you know what happened today?
I don't want to fail again.
It is yet to be seen whether this plan will succeed or not.
It isn't a major problem.
I couldn't kill Tom.
Don't you have something to do?
Tom is unbeatable.
I tried to warn Tom.
You don't know what it's like to lose your entire family in a war.
I wish it would snow.
Do you know something I don't know?
She is likely to come.
I woke you up.
Every website has a unique address.
Do I usually seem happy?
I hope something bad doesn't happen to us.
"I understand your point of view, but don't agree with it."
Tom would've stayed longer if he could've.

I need new glasses.
I think I'll take that one.
Tom'll survive.
Are you still waiting for someone?
I know how we can help.
How did you get into my room?
Tom sat very still.
Tom and I don't go fishing together anymore.
You need to rest now.
Let's go to my place.
My dad is busy.
"The bill, please."
Why are we dealing with Tom?
The soup is very salty.
Tom visited the Colosseum in Rome.
I managed to catch the 8 o'clock train by running all the way to the station.
Give me that one.
What I said yesterday still stands.
Berries can be frozen.
I can't even afford to buy a used car.
Pull yourself together!
I play the piano.
Don't you think this is ridiculous?
"To make matters worse, his wife fell ill."
There was a terrible accident on the freeway.
I'm completely naked.
Their house is far from the station.
Tom came to visit.
The electricity has been off since this morning.
The boy fell and scraped his knee.
I was the one who taught Tom to read.
Please do it.
"Money can't buy happiness. However, it's more comfortable to cry in a Maserati than on a bike."
Please tell me where to go next.
I forbid you to go there.
My parents are crazy.
I have a horse.
We all watch way too much TV.
You should try to behave better.
"Hold on, Tom."
I commit my son to your care.
I'm going abroad next summer.
I wasn't scared at all.
What are your aspirations for the future?
You can trust me.
This isn't in French.
She gave him a piece of paper.
Are you sure Tom won't be busy?
You cannot undo what has already been done.
Tom won the lottery.
"Can I see your ticket? ""Yes. Here it is."""
Tom looked sad.
I'm sure that Tom is waiting for you.

I ride the subway every day.
There's nothing to apologize for.
I'm going to take a bath as soon as I get home.
Children were running to and fro in the park.
I'm not very young.
You don't know them as well as I do.
I'm a native French speaker.
It's a windy day.
I agree with you absolutely.
"Can you go, too?"
You're a good pitcher.
Tom and Mary seem to be suited for each other.
We did that yesterday.
Tom has lost his car keys.
Tom wasn't joking.
They weren't busy.
You and I should talk.
"I'm happy to have you here, Tom."
What's the longest word in French?
Here I am again.
It is so early.
Tom has lived in Boston most of his life.
"If you need any help, ask me."
You should go back to Boston.
I love lentil soup.
Tom probably did that on purpose.
I prefer to be alone.
Tom won't let Mary win.
I need you to take a look at this.
What do I have?
Where did you go after your talk with Tom?
Thank you very much for your letter of January 7th.
I hope you don't say something stupid.
I miss you very much.
He hurried to the station.
I'm sorry if I'm bothering you.
You could've told me earlier.
Everybody's in position.
I thought you lived by yourself.
My jaw hurts.
Tom couldn't start the motor.
We don't like to get involved.
I don't want to do that without Tom's help.
He won everything.
Is your dog deaf?
Suddenly all the lights went out.
I'm just a little dizzy.
What do you call them?
Tom told Mary that he'd forgiven her.
Tom thought Mary had already gone home.
Everything was much simpler then.
Why do you really want to lose weight?
The events unfolded just as she predicted.
How can you be sure?
"As soon as I can get a decent video camera, I'll start making videos to put online."
They're able students.
I wash my hands before eating.
You told me not to do that.
Can I have a bit more milk?
Tom bought the newspaper.
Tom doesn't want to go to bed.
Why do you want a dog?
Tom just stared at Mary without saying a word.
One day Tom will understand.
Tom thought the meeting was a waste of time.
Do you like French literature?
All people breathe air.
I suppose you want to ask me why I didn't go to your party last night.
Everyone but you laughed.
Tom is supposed to be arriving today.
Tom pulled off his shoes.
I saw Tom outside.
Were you in America last month?
Don't you understand what's happening?
I told Tom that he should call Mary.
Tom hurt Mary's feelings.
I didn't ask for money.
Would you change your past if you could?
The fun is just getting started.
"That's what I was thinking, too."
Tom doesn't have very many friends.
What's your goal?
There were white clouds sailing in the sky.
It's going to be difficult to do that.
We're behind schedule.
I hate being laughed at.
Tom was just being polite.
Tom earns a lot of money.
I watched a movie with Tom.
I'm not a very good carpenter.
I wasn't very hungry.
So you really don't know?
Tom is always here on Mondays.
I didn't do that today.
I'm not going without you.
Don't forget to write.
She has seven sons.
I'll miss you after you've gone.
I almost fell off the cliff.
Say it's not true.
We live in the suburbs.
"Tom, you've disappointed me."
I don't think anyone else wants to do that.
I had a very strange dream last night.
How long has Tom lived in Boston?
I'm used to being ignored.
Did you watch TV yesterday?
They drove away.
I'm unaccustomed to this.
Do you recognize me?
I haven't seen you in almost three years.
Are you homeless?
Let's call for help.
He doesn't like fish.
I want to get out of the car and stretch.
Don't you dare answer that.
You're such an idiot.
They're closed today.
I hate long goodbyes.
It's difficult to grow anything in this soil.
Tom is in my room.
I thought I heard a thud.
I talk a lot.
You owe it to yourself to do it.
Did you return Tom's books?
These tickets didn't cost me anything.
This park reminds me of my childhood.
They're finished.
You didn't even cry.
She gave him a watch.
She's not my sister.
I suspect that Tom cheated on the test.
Everybody believes it.
You have to leave home at six.
How would you answer this question?
Many teachers have a problem with Tom.
Tom misses you.
"Tom could be in Boston, I suppose."
It's fun to build a snowman in winter.
Don't talk to me that way.
"Though he knew the truth, he told us nothing."
"You're not in a hurry, are you?"
You can count on her.
He treated me badly.
Tom didn't want to talk to his wife.
Let him do it.
I hope Tom doesn't know what you've done.
You are comparing apples and oranges.
I know them all.
They're escaping.
Please fix it.
If only you'd thought of that before shooting your big mouth off.
Everybody didn't go to bed.
Tom told Mary about the fire.
Tom believes the system is broken.
They may come back.
"This book is surprisingly easy to read, isn't it?"
You're acting like a three-year-old.
Tom will be scolded by his father.
What are you doing now?
I have three young kids.
It's little too early to do that.
I thought Tom didn't have a driver's license.
Tom's car caught fire.
I wonder where Tom put the key.
Tom's mother makes all his clothes.
Tom's father was very strict.
My name isn't on the list.
I love butterflies.
You look stressed out.
We're really good friends.
Tom told the police that Mary's sudden disappearance was out of character for her.
I will pick you up around six.
I really hate to see you in such pain.
We have nowhere to hide.
I feel sorry for the children.
Drive carefully.
Tom was the black sheep of the family.
I don't want to be cruel.
We heard shots.
I can't answer that question now.
I thought you'd be comfortable here.
That was quite an experience we had yesterday.
Tom wants to live.
You know I'm married.
I'm afraid I can't finish this report on time.
Don't tell Tom I'm here.
I can't go on Saturday.
Tom and Mary are on duty.
You have to work.
Our teacher demanded that we keep quiet.
Now drink up.
Tom wants to talk to Mary.
I wonder why Tom is so worried.
I'm aware you've already finished.
Tom showed Mary how to do it.
Crying won't bring your parents back.
Why didn't you warn me?
French is her first language.
Nonstop flights are almost always more expensive.
Defend yourself.
I didn't know that Tom does that.
I hope you're staying.
Tom is going to be a great coach.
Tom is the only one likely to be able to help you.
There isn't anywhere else to park.
Give me the phone.
You're very kind.
Fine feathers make fine birds.
I've told you everything I know about Tom.
Tom tried to deceive me.
Tom will never forgive himself.
Do you want me to go home?
She turned her back to me.
Do you know what I did?
You're just on time.
He flunked his driving test three times.
Have you already booked our seats on a plane?
What happened to your car?
We look forward to seeing you.
I'll go do that.
I have backstage passes to Tom's concert.
I thought that you hated Australia.
Tom was unable to conceal his anger.
I didn't know which road to take.
I have nothing more to say to you.
Did you tell Tom why he shouldn't do that?
Tom wanted to become a Canadian citizen.
How did you get to the stadium?
I didn't think Tom would come.
Tom isn't drowning.
I will never forget the day when I first met him.
Wouldn't it be better if you did that by yourself?
He encouraged his son to study harder.
The sun rises in the east and sets in the west.
I want you to talk to me.
Show me what you have in your left hand.
Let's go the extra mile.
When was the last time that you used this?
Tom has done that again.
Mary likes milk very much.
Tom's lying.
I'm glad that Tom has decided to do that.
He has a white dog.
I'm not sure I want Tom working for us.
The temperature went down three degrees.
Do you have Tom's number?
I never make my bed.
I think Tom will cry.
Don't give me that.
It's not here.
We're going to need them both.
Didn't you know Tom used to live Boston?
They don't pay me enough.
The skin of a shark is much rougher than that of a tuna fish.
Tom didn't bat an eye.
Just tell us what to do.
They fixed it.
Have you told Tom why you need to go to Boston?
There are more than seven thousand languages in the world.
I'm going to go change.
My bag was stolen.
Try and do it.
Tom knows where you live.
Just leave Tom alone.
You have some spaghetti sauce on your face.
It won't be easy for us to find Tom.
It's only three days till Christmas.
I'll tell you about it someday.
What happened to our food?
I need a new one.
I'm high.
How did you arrive at that conclusion?
Tom knew I was surprised.
Didn't I tell you not to close the door?
What's your favorite role-playing game?
How do you think that makes me feel?
Have you been there?
Tom has been warned.
Tom and Mary were friends in high school and started dating a few years after graduating.
My dog is smaller than yours is.
I am accustomed to studying English every evening.
What're you going to do with that?
"You loved them, didn't you?"
I'll never marry Tom.
I think you're lying.
Tom is mowing his lawn.
I don't think Tom has much experience.
Would you like to go to the zoo with me?
Please call me before you come.
Do you know how to drive a car?
Smoking is bad for you.
You should've told me yesterday.
I stayed awake until morning.
Tell Tom to stay where he is.
I looked.
She eats nothing but vegetables.
Please come again in three days time.
I've got nothing to confess.
He came downstairs.
Didn't you know Tom saw you doing that?
I said don't talk to me.
I just wanted Mary to love me.
I know that I need to do that.
Tom was punished.
Do you want me to quit?
Do cats dream?
What is this?
This knife isn't sharp.
They went fishing yesterday.
Are you rich?
Show me the exact spot you mean.
We collect plastic bottles.
Tell me what's wrong with Tom.
I love you and I want to marry you.
I agree with you to a certain extent.
I thought you said nothing happened.
He took me to school by car.
I thought that you looked sad.
Tom told me he didn't want to move to Australia.
I'll come again when you're free.
I've never seen Tom laugh.
I didn't get that.
Tom didn't try to argue.
We picked a hitchhiker up on the way to Boston.
I can't tell you my plans.
"If you want, we can talk later."
Tom has been living in Boston since 2013.
You can stay here for a while if you want to.
How long will you stay in Tokyo?
Is the cat on the chair or under the chair?
I knew that that would happen.
This is the shortest way to the station.
It's extremely dangerous.
I promise that I won't tell anybody why we're here.
"He makes most, if not all, of the important decisions for his company."
Tom is a voice actor.
Behind every great man there's a great woman.
I want to study math.
"Some juice, please."
Please tell Tom it's urgent.
Tom spent the last years of his life in Boston.
The ship dropped anchor.
The law is not always fair.
"Joking aside, what are you trying to say?"
This costs more than that.
I don't know if Tom likes me or not.
I'd better think this over.
Tom cut a small hole in the wall.
Aren't you tired of doing this?
That's incorrect.
Tom had no idea how tired Mary was.
Tom and Mary have become missionaries.
I'm happy to hear you're doing well.
Neither Tom nor Mary has been helping me.
Tom himself sewed on the button that had fallen off.
I like it when you do that.
"Tom is going to be there, too."
I was to have finished the work yesterday.
He proved to be a spy.
The man looked at me.
Are there any messages for me?
Things got out of hand.
Did you find it?
I want Mary.
Why did you want to speak to me?
He is likely to come.
He asked a question about it.
It's a free country.
I rested in the shade of a tree.
You won't have to do that.
How long does it take to walk to the station?
Tom is very gifted and talented.
He was exposed to many dangers.
Reports are due next Monday.
I'm glad I'm a man.
Please sing a song.
Tom took off his shoes.
Are you sure Tom did that?
"After he ate, Tom went to bed."
What do you consider your greatest achievement?
Do you want to hear more?
Tom almost always wins arguments.
How long have you been here in Boston?
It's too flashy.
I don't think that Tom knows where Mary wants to live.
What'll you be doing this summer?
Tell me I'm wrong.
How many children do you have?
Tom's dog bit me.
May I join you?
Do you want to know the truth?
Can I come with you?
Tom threw the gun into the river.
Is that Tom's wife?
Tom told me he intended to win.
I'll be back in October.
Her mother is a wonderful pianist.
Is it true you bought a house in Australia?
It's too conspicuous.
Tom drank some poison by mistake.
Where are my glasses?
We're in Boston.
What's happening now in Australia?
Tom wanted people to like him.
Didn't you know that I'd do that?
This is the first time I've written a letter in German.
How much longer do you plan to be in Boston?
Someone is watching.
I tried to save him.
I prefer working to doing nothing.
I have a lot of photos.
Tom was fined three hundred dollars.
Tom bought a car using his savings.
What kind of men do you like?
He is older and wiser now.
I'm glad that I said that.
You should've told me in advance.
I want to drink milk.
Something bad happened in Boston yesterday.
This was more difficult than I thought it would be.
Why do you hang out with Tom?
He will follow my advice.
I don't know whether to accept or refuse.
I thought that you were right.
Boston was our first stop.
I'll wait for you in the lobby.
Tom thought it was a good idea.
That's a beautiful photo.
What proof do you have?
Tom almost forgot about the meeting.
I had my watch stolen yesterday.
I didn't think you even liked Tom.
Where did you see Tom?
"Bring me the menu, please."
I've been taking dancing lessons.
The children drew pictures on the sidewalk with chalk.
Have you ever done this before?
I'm counting the minutes until I see you again.
We all know what Tom meant.
Tom told me he'd fly to Boston.
Have a look around.
Tom is getting paranoid.
I'm going to write Tom a long letter.
Which car do you like more?
How many pens does she have?
Tom switched off the light.
My father hasn't gone abroad even once.
When was this university founded?
Nobody wants to talk to me anymore.
Are you in the house?
"What languages do you speak, Tom?"
Tom doesn't always win.
"I was happy, wasn't I?"
He was an utter stranger.
I have only one sister.
I've already spoken to Tom about it.
Tom lacks imagination.
Take over.
It's very cold.
Tom rolled up his pant legs so they wouldn't get wet.
None of us knew the answer.
Why does Tom like living in Boston?
I'd never ask you to do that.
Tom said you were crazy.
Tom is in bed with a cold.
I've offended you.

I don't want anybody talking about me.
Make it larger.
You need to get up.
They're idiots.
You promised me you'd look after Tom.
This movie is very interesting to me.
"Tom didn't want to stay, but he did."
They wouldn't let anyone talk to me.
I've heard the French version of this song.
Tom is a journalist.
Tom didn't like that movie.
Could you tell me how to adjust the volume?
Tom told me that he spoke French.
Tom pretended everything was OK.
I have a big black dog.
Tom asked for Mary by name.
I can't believe I'm talking to you about this.
Tom thinks Mary will be ready.
That isn't enough.
Locate Boston on the map.
I was negligent.
Tom is too fat.
I am glad to hear of your success.
He wanted to succeed.
I always wanted to be different.
You've won!
I wasn't scared at all.
He moved to Tokyo.
Opposites attract.
Give me the money.
That's generous of you.
"At first, I didn't believe you."
Next Monday would be a good time to do that.
I'll decide later.
I know Tom isn't stupid.
How did you learn French?
Tom wasn't the one who told me to do this.
You'll get fired.
They'll be well paid.
He had the gall to ignore my advice.
I fell asleep around midnight.
I'd like Tom to meet Mary.
He put special emphasis on the problem.
I need to know why you're here.
I don't know when I'll be able to get back to Boston.
Nobody here smokes.
Why haven't you told Tom?
Delete Tom's name from the list.

This is a good dictionary.
Which country are you from?
It's in good hands.
It seems to me that you don't agree.
I need another one.
Please tell me what's going on.
I have to warn Tom.
I lost my wallet yesterday morning.
"It's bad, I know."
Everybody likes it here.
I have to stop worrying.
What did you eat for dinner?
Tom made a necklace for Mary.
We all saw Tom.
What's my assignment?
I got married yesterday.
It's the first door on the right.
Many flowers start blooming in springtime.
I can't eat fruit in the morning.
You don't even know who sent this to you.
I started dancing.
I solved the problem easily.
It has started to rain.
Tom paid no attention to Mary's advice.
Do you want to hear the truth?
Take this or that.
Do you like playing basketball?
I knew it couldn't be that simple.
Tom didn't go there.
Turn left and you will find the cafe.
We don't want your money.
Why do you say that?
Tom is hiding behind the door.
Tom left a note.
I'll never forget how kind you have been.
You never know with Tom.
I'm sure you'll like your new job.
Give Tom something to eat.
"Next time, I'll do it myself."
What's up with you today?
My reputation is at stake.
I can't live with you anymore.
He stood behind the chair.
Why does Tom treat Mary that way?
How much does a three-year old weigh?
"You're lost, aren't you?"
We can make a deal.
I'm sure that Tom will win.
Tell Tom that I'll do that.
I don't like English.
You should open all the windows.
I must talk with Tom.
It's a difficult word to translate.

This is one of Boston's best hotels.
Tell Tom we don't want to go.
Tom came to Mary's rescue.
I don't expect you to be my friend.
Could you tell me something about your family?
You're a very good football player.
It doesn't matter whether you do that or not.
Tom is upset because he didn't get the raise that he'd been promised.
The door is open now.
The sand was warm.
I think that you should watch that movie.
Tom doesn't get enough sleep.
How do you pronounce that?
You should eat something before you go.
Tom is just bored.
Mary likes both Tom and John.
I want you to tell the truth.
I'm putting you on hold.
I can't tell you who's on the list because I haven't seen the list yet.
Which one do you like best?
We'll follow Tom.
I made her cry.
Tom didn't turn around.
Just let me see it.
I don't like baseball.
How are you feeling?
I didn't call you.
Tom asked me if I'd bought any eggs.
People were not prepared for the storm.
Everyone thinks you're dead.

Tom has a hard-to-pronounce last name.
Something bad's going to happen.

I don't know why that should surprise me.
Tom and Mary have gone to Australia.
Tom told them not to do that.
Show it to her.
I'm living with my mom now.
Any comments are welcome.
I didn't tell Tom you were here.
This is your only opportunity.
Please don't do that now.
I think I like eating white rice better than brown rice.
I braced myself.
The remark was aimed at you.
You'll do what I tell you to do.
We're not the only ones who have to do this.
I've never seen anything like this.
That's what I pay you for.
He took a risk when he helped me.
What did you do over the weekend?
We have an open relationship.
Here's my number.
I'll try not to make mistakes next time.
Do you like surprises?
Tom chopped down the tree.
That's all Tom did.
I haven't forgiven you.
I forgot to attach a stamp to the envelope.
Many Germans have blonde hair and blue eyes.

Be careful not to burn yourself.
Tom is planting trees.
Isn't it time for you to leave?
Who did Tom play golf with?
I want a cup of coffee and I want it now.
A storm is brewing.
Tom isn't at home.
This is the only alternative.
I know that you lied.
I have to admit it's very tempting.
Do you know when Tom will do that?
I asked him to make four copies of the letter.
I didn't touch your guitar.
I won't leave tomorrow.
Mary never wears makeup.
I know that Tom is hungry.
I've done that myself.
Tom didn't say anything about how the party went.
You should study French harder.
"In Canada, there are many areas where it is illegal to log trees."
Where did you get the idea?
Mary can't decide whether or not to buy the dress.
I can't believe you still trust Tom.
I think I'll have breakfast.
I think you've overcooked the broccoli.
I didn't want anyone to see me.
He is now either in Rome or in Paris.
Did you see him at the station this morning?
I need your passport and three pictures.
Tom has already left.
Give it a try.
It looks like my job's done.
You need a new hat.
He is less patient than his brother.
Some people never grow up.
I have to go out.
Tom didn't listen.
All babies cry.
It's no laughing matter.
I know who to give it to.
Do I have to do it right away?

Tom shook hands with Mary.
You're a little weird.

Tell me what my options are.
Tom said he'd leave.
Haven't I told you never to call me here?
Mary is expecting a girl.
It strikes me as a bit unusual.
I'm sorry that I have troubled you so much.

Are you intentionally trying to confuse me?
Tell me where Tom has gone.
I didn't know that you were upset.
Tom heard wolves howling.
Tom dug a hole in the backyard.
Our office is on the northern side of the building.
I was impressed with her work.
He is now staying in Paris.

Tom told me he had to go.
Wash your feet.
Tom is Mary's biological father.
I'll do everything I can to help you.
Who needs computers?
Tom raised his right hand.
The stream is not very swift.
You're not going to win.
I think you knew my father.
You often do that.
I'm disappointed with you.
Have the police questioned you yet?
The car stopped.
I've finished cleaning my room.
He's in my class.
That's what I'm fighting for.
Do you like walking?
I don't think Tom will have to do that by himself.
Yours is better.
"I think you have a problem, Tom."
I want to come in.
I'm not a singer.
Follow him.
I'm going to be doing that soon.
Nothing was stolen.
I know you hate it.
Let's try to clear up this misunderstanding.
I thought you were from Boston.
Everybody started to laugh.
I don't deny that.
How I've missed you!
What's happened to you?
Are you in place?
It's the perfect spot for a honeymoon.
Can't you take a joke?
Tom didn't want to talk to Mary about work.
I'm trying not to be seen.

I don't think I'll get there on time.
Have you fed the dog yet?
Let's start with the good news.
It was stupid of you to have turned down the offer.
My mother often bakes apple pies for us.
Tom looked out the window and saw Mary.
Losing one's health is worse than losing money.
I'll sit over there.
Tom just wants to be loved.
Tom has never celebrated Christmas.
Tom doesn't know much either.
"Tom will want to do that, I'm sure."
I saw it on the news.
I'm in the same boat as you.
Tom thought the amulet would protect him from witches.
Is it a butterfly or a moth?
Close your eyes and count to ten.

I can't give you any more details at this time.
I know that Tom can swim.
Are you going to kiss me or not?
Were you at the library yesterday afternoon?
I'm going to throw a party.
Tom made a promise to himself that he would never make the same mistake again.
She asked him to carry her bag.
Divide the cake among you three.
He did his best to rescue her.
She is five years younger than me.
Tom grinned.
Let's congratulate Tom.
The light hit Tom's eyes.
You're not permitted to do that anymore.
Tom and Mary were looking at each other.
I knew you'd be busy today.
Tom provided evidence.
How many eggs did you buy?
Do you want to know what it means?
Are you finicky?
Bring your friends.
I don't know where I should look.
I was interviewed for a job.
Tom went to the beach.
I've never seen anything more beautiful in my life.
It was for Tom and Mary.
This won't help.
I don't know where else to look.
That was a nice hotel.
Why should Tom visit Boston?
The cat ruined my sofa.
My father will be forty-five in May.
The world's tropical rainforests are critical links in the ecological chain of life on the planet.
You don't know that.
The play was presented by a group of young actors.
Tom and I know each other well.
She whispered it in my ear.
I know Tom is likely to regret doing that.
You said you needed help.
Slow down!
Are you tired now?
"After the concert, Tom signed autographs."
You have to change buses at the next stop.
I was weak.
I'll call you back later.
They're boring.
Taste it.
You're very smart.
He's always on time.
Cats like boxes.
Tom is in a big hurry.
"Tom is taller than you, isn't he?"
You play tennis well.
Do you remember how we met?
I asked her to pick me up around four.
They don't know anything about you.
I'm not used to cooking on a campfire.
I've told you about it before.
It makes little difference.
I'm not used to being yelled at.
Don't you know the truth?
I want to send a message to my friend Tom.
"In fact, I am happy."
This problem comes up every day.
Please tell me where I should change trains.
I'll pick you up after work.
"We're talking to you, Tom."
You are so kind.
"I lost my way and, what was worse, it began to rain."
He asked for help.
I need you to do that immediately.
Tom knew that I was ready.
We are different heights. He is taller than me.
I'm still waiting for it to happen.
I know that Tom hardly ever does that.
The wind has died down.
I sleep in the nude.
Let's talk about your problem.
Tom has found the problem.
She starts her job at seven o'clock.
I think this will work.
Tom rushed upstairs.
"You're Tom's parents, aren't you?"
This is Tom's cat.
Tom raised his hat.
Nobody told us anything.
I need to go to the drugstore to buy some medicine for Tom.
I want to know who started this.
Where would you most like to live?
The history of France is very interesting.
I don't see any bruises.
I wish I were wrong.
"No matter how many people tell Tom he made a mistake, he still insists he's right."
I'll answer you tomorrow.
How do you know all these things?
"If you don't want to go, you don't need to."
Tom was the one who came up with the design.

Don't you have an opinion?

He often paints landscapes.
I'm awfully afraid of heights.
The end is in sight.
Tom works as a translator.

We happened to be on the same train.
What did you feel?
I don't agree with this.
Put it back.
Tom is waiting for you at the bar.
Tom is with a patient.
Do you think you can catch me?
I don't have a choice. I have to do this now.
Who do you think will win the race?
I was your student a few years ago.
I wanted to know if you'd heard anything about what's going to be discussed at tomorrow's meeting.
It was so romantic.
Let's get serious.
Tom will stop at nothing to achieve his goal.
Tom always travels by car.
Be quiet now.
I really liked this book.
I can't move my leg.
Tom doesn't want to go to the beach.
Tom is an excellent tennis player.
I waited for Tom until 2:30.
How could I know that Tom would get so angry?
My feet hurt.
Problems don't usually go away by themselves.
"In 1975, Angola became a free nation."
Tom lived to be 93.
This is incorrect.
Tom isn't used to this kind of cold weather.
I know most people here don't like me very much.
Tom didn't want to harm Mary.
I wanted to learn French.
It's too soon to tell whether it's a boy or a girl.
I want to be there for Tom.
Tom said that he'd help me.
You don't need money.
I'm Tom's new secretary.
Thanks for sharing this.
What should I talk about?
Tom took off his cap.
He had no idea what these words meant.
Help me.
I was employee of the year for three years.
I'll go on my own.
"Personally, I don't like it."
I'm very tired. I don't feel like taking a walk now.
It hasn't been easy.
I'm really tired tonight.
I've got a wife and child.
Tom won't likely remember me.
Talk to Tom.
That's not what I wanted to tell you.
I brought mine.
When did you get here?
Tom lifted his hat politely.
Tom wants to marry Mary and John's daughter.
"In 1911, a revolt broke out."
I'm going to miss this place.
Don't do it!
Just give me one more chance.
Tom was such a cute kid.
I think I know your brother.
We must not retreat.
"I'm not talking about you, Tom."
Everyone's looking for you.
I wanted to do it.
What was discussed?
The ship wasn't ready for battle.
Please bear this fact in mind.
Measles can be quite dangerous.

How many times has this problem occurred?
Tom doesn't want to go there.

He's very open.
Are you two really dating?

You two should get married.
He has a good knowledge of Russian grammar.
Tom is unpredictable.
You're incredibly beautiful.
I told Tom I didn't know where Mary lived.
I never called Tom back.
Could you bring my breakfast to room 305?
Don't be such a baby.
I am sure of his success.
I just want you to know that Tom is safe.
We wanted to talk to you.
"On my way home, I fell asleep on the train and rode past my station."
I took care of that.
The girl I told you about lives in Kyoto.
I'll make some coffee.
I threw the ball to Tom.
Why don't you give me your number?
I'd stop doing that if you asked me to.
A crocodile has eaten Tom.
I'll ask Tom to buy tickets for us.
I bought her a clock.
Does anybody know that you're here?
Let's not talk about it now.
I took the wheels off of my bicycle.
Something has happened to my car.
I'm ready for the next step.
I am convinced of his innocence.
Were they lying?
Which one do you like the most?
Tom told me to talk to you.
I'll keep you informed.
You sure have a lot of friends.
Where's your son?
All the color went from Tom's face.
100 years is called a century.
Where's the closest pharmacy?
Everybody knows that Tom did it.
Tom died instantly.
I prefer to travel alone.
I don't know which shirt to wear.
Do you know that dog's name?
I can't even believe I'm doing this.
Are you allergic to any medications?
Can you come?
She patiently waited for him.
I'm too young to join the army.
Tom looked totally embarrassed.
I don't have your number.
Tom said he didn't have a job.
I'll do it anyway.
I was so confused.
This is a waste of time.
You can go back to bed.
Tom hardly ever speaks to me anymore.
They left very early in the morning.
"Anyway, it's my problem."
Tom didn't even offer Mary a cup of coffee.
Tom is the only one in our family who can't speak French.
Tom thinks that he knows who really did that.
He thought someone had put poison in his soup.
I didn't even ask.
Which one was it?
It is perfectly natural for him to be proud of his son.
It's a figure of speech.
How old were you when you had your first girlfriend?
Look who's back.
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
Tom called Mary over.
We know that Tom doesn't want to do that.
"Most of all, I hate wearing socks."
He will be a good husband.
I have a small gift for you.
"I saw it, too."
I promise not to disappoint you.
No one says that.
Tom must be in Boston.
I love spring.
I won't cry anymore.
My mother is preparing breakfast.
Do you know Tom's phone number?
Aren't you thirsty?
She did not answer all the questions.
I've been thinking about the meaning of life.
I'm cleaning the kitchen.
Tom isn't at work today.
I prefer tea to coffee.
The tines of the fork are bent.
I missed you a lot.
I thought this pair of shoes would last longer.
The kidnappers tied my hands behind my back.
Tom got fired on his first day.
We're going inside.
You have only three options.
I never thought it would be so easy.
We can wait.
Tom is pretty aggressive.
We're not that close.
You are going to have to pay for it.
Should I tell Tom you're coming?
Tom isn't as tall as his brother.
Stop biting your nails.
Tom came home later than usual yesterday.
I learned that from Tom.
I'm not going to tell Tom about what happened.
I thought it was an earthquake.
I'm not as intelligent as Tom.
Tom was Mary's first boyfriend.
Tom didn't want me to sell my old truck.
I'd like to stay here until Tom gets back.
Don't swim here.
I had to hurry.
You're no saint.
This gate needs painting.
Were you with Tom that night?
Take his car keys.
"I have a lot of baggage, so I can't walk home."
I just need time to think.
"The older you are, the more difficult it is to learn a language."
It's a messy situation.
What do you think it means?
The circus has a wonderful collection of wild animals.
They'll remember.
Be careful not to break these eggs.
Let me do that myself.
Tom couldn't answer my question.
Tom finally noticed what Mary was doing.
Are you sure Tom is here?
You've made several mistakes.
You've betrayed us all.
This is my beer.
I had an interesting conversation with Tom.
I'll contact Tom.
Tom slept like a baby.
Halloween is not a religious holiday.
Am I on the right road?
Take off your clothes.
I hope that all your dreams come true.
Mary pretended she was sick to avoid going to school.
I know that look.
Don't speak French here.
I'll show you where.
"Friends are easy to find, but they're hard to keep."
Smoking is not permitted here.
I don't want Tom making the same mistakes I made.
I don't know if I can trust you.
I think it's a bad idea.
I'm awaiting inspiration.
Let me get you something to eat.
Did you read the letter I sent you?
I will make a man of you.
When did you go there?
Could I borrow a saw?
Learn to think positively.
I saw you at the flower shop.
I've missed you so much.
The athletes trained hard every day to be at their best for the Summer Olympics.
Are you going to help Tom?
I came back.
Tom refused to give Mary what she wanted.
Tom doesn't blame Mary for being mad.
I'm married and I have children.
I think Tom is doing well.
I need a light coat.
Tom will find Mary.
I'm not mad. I'm just sad.
Take a look at that.
Tom tossed his dog some bread.
Our house is up for sale.
I work on a farm.
I don't really want to paint my house blue.
Why is it so important to you?
Tom is in the other room drinking vodka.
Where were they going?
What's your favorite sport to watch?
Which one is better?
I can't live without you.
Tom has already been told about the problem.
Do you have any new potatoes?
I almost believe you.
There are no people on the moon.
Call me if you find anything.
How do you know that Tom was the one who did it?
Tom told me about his son.
A pair of gloves was left in the taxi.
Tom cut his finger and it's bleeding pretty badly.
Tom wants you.
I sometimes break the rules.
Those who know him speak well of him.
I love chili.
You should bear that in mind.
I don't want to wait until tomorrow.
Tom and Mary are downstairs.
Tom doesn't know what happened because he wasn't there.
We've got everything.
I'm ashamed that my son is such a lazybones.
Do you really want to risk that?
They asked a lot of questions about my past experience.
Things were different then.
You can swim much better than Tom can.
I want to dye my hair black.
Tom needed a good job.
I am never at home on Sundays.
Can you tell me how it happened?
Tomorrow he'll play tennis.
Go up those stairs.
Tom broke the point of the knife.
Which prince is the legitimate heir to the throne?
This child has been adopted.
I knew it was wrong.
He gave me an apple.
I wonder whether you understand.
You can't park there.
I know where Tom went last weekend.
You're a weird guy.
You're fun.
I wish I hadn't married you.
How's your patient?
"If anybody could convince Tom, it would be Mary."
You didn't seem certain.
My father was a pacifist who refused to fight in the Vietnam War.
Tom introduced Mary to his daughter.
"If it rains tomorrow, we'll not go there."
I thought Tom would win.
Drinking alcohol during pregnancy can cause birth defects.
Can Tom swim?
Tom told me that he used to be very poor.
Tom didn't talk to anyone.
Jackson could not trust them.
What language was that?
What did you say that for?
Tom depends too much on Mary.
The road was wet from the rain.
I have done that already.
It's a snap once you get the hang of it.
Those students really can't read.
It's such a shame you're leaving.
Tom will be asleep.
I don't know Tom.
Tom didn't need to explain it to me.
Please keep in mind that we have to be with other students.
Tom thinks Mary is bored.
Here comes the bus.
Are you hiding something?
Tom and I lost our jobs.
Instant noodles are a staple among college students.
There was no TV or radio in those days.
Even Tom said he'd help.
Tom is probably going to win.
Do you really want to know where we went?
Weren't you tired?
Why do you always wear white shirts?
You're my only true friend.
Tom could've told me about this earlier.
Back off.
Tom inherited all of his father's property.
Is this what you were looking for?
I'm no hero.
You're not my assistant.
We live near a big library.
I brought Tom home.
Can't you understand?
My plan worked perfectly.
I won't be able to do that without your help.
There is a mistake in this sentence.
I didn't have to go with Tom.
I used to play alone when I was a child.
This is garbage.
I was cold.
I thought we agreed.
All I need is about three hundred more dollars.
You must meet with him.
I don't like working here.
What exactly are you planning to buy?
Have you measured it?
I think I should go.
What'll be next?
We want your advice.
Tom always gets up at 6:30.
She wants me to go with her.
I have absolutely no intention of going there alone.
They stood there.
What about next Sunday?
It's getting worse and worse.
Tom is waiting for your answer.
I nearly did that.
I do not like wearing anybody else's clothes.
Tom decided not to go to the meeting.
Tell me when you're done.
Tom is old enough to travel alone.
Tom has shaved off his mustache.
What's the population of Australia?
Is this your flight?
Is he still interested?
I suggested that the meeting be put off.
The water is pure.
Tom has promised not to be late.
Mary confessed to being a witch.
Tom works at Harvard.
I did it already.
Tom vowed to rescue Mary.
"You don't really want that, do you?"
Tom is having a rest.
They all rose.
This book is widely available in libraries.
Tom walked up to the third floor.
She can skate.
Let me pay.
I miss all this.
When did you read this book?
Tom will fix it.
We're happy with our car.
Can you read that?
I can hardly believe this.
Write it in pencil.
When can I get out of here?
We discussed our plans for the summer holidays.
I saw Tom in Boston last weekend.
You don't look like a doctor.
Are you here on business?
It took many years to build it.
We'll keep in touch.
I'm going to talk to Tom when he comes home.
I'm sure you can do better.
We're not coming.
We'll die sooner or later.
You hurt my feelings.
Where is my pen?
Did Tom buy anything for Mary?
I think we need to do that.
I'm only here because of you.
Tom said that you were angry.
I had too much to drink last night.
Tom is modest.
Are you up?
"You don't know who Tom is, do you?"
Tom can't tie his shoes.
He's written a lot of good material that has never seen the light of day.
I have the same dictionary as your brother.
I hope to be able to come back to Boston someday.
I don't tell people what to eat.
They couldn't help us.
You can't mix oil with water.
We have friends in common.
Can I borrow your car tonight?
Just get up.
Tom became a cop.
Is that all you've got to say?
I tore my pants.
Did Tom sing at your wedding?
I'm a city dweller.
Tom opened his locker.
The farmers didn't know what to do.
We're saving money to buy a house.
An idea occurred to me.
What're you hiding behind your back?
You sound like a lawyer.
You are impossible.
A kiss without a mustache is like an egg without salt.
Do you like to dance?
It is hard for foreigners to learn Japanese.
You don't look Japanese.
Your argument is invalid.
I don't like the way he looks at you.
I don't remember giving Tom a key.
I'm sure that I'm wrong.
I didn't want to tell you that on the phone.
Which beer is yours?
Is there a bank near here?
I suspect that Tom didn't enjoy doing that.
That's the wrong question.
Did you put water in the refrigerator?
Can you tell us where we are?
"Year after year, production continued to increase."
Russia is the largest country in the world.
I've done everything Tom asked me to do.
Tom told me he didn't eat pork.
You can stay here all night if you want.
You shouldn't have come alone.
I know that Tom isn't going to pay me for doing this.
I didn't sign anything.
What are you wearing?
The hospital is crowded.
I'm reading a book about languages.
Tom doesn't need to take his shoes off.
Tom told me how much he weighed.
Tom locked his dog in the bathroom.
I was expecting to find Tom here.
Let me stay with you.
A spark caused the gunpowder to explode.
Go with your friends.
You should go talk to Tom.
Don't tell me you've never heard of Tom Jackson.
Tom told me to stay.
Did you make coffee?
I can't remember where I hid my money.
Tom told me he needed some cash.
What did they ask you to do?
"Don't drink from the bottle, please."
I heard that Tom plans to move to Australia.
Tom said that he was very busy.
Could you tell me?
An expert is a specialist who knows everything about something and nothing about anything else.
Tom handed it to Mary.
Don't trust your memory.
I left a note for Tom.
What's their plan?
It all depends on the weather.
"Although I was exhausted, I continued to work."
I've had coffee already.
Tom is wearing a Red Cross button.
That's what I should've done.
I'm not sure that I can trust Tom.
How many weeks of vacation do you have?
Who helped Tom?
"Are those your books? ""No, they aren't."""
Tom has a black car.
You have to promise never to tell anyone what I'm about to tell you.
Do you have any questions for me?
I couldn't help blushing.
Tom and Mary were both fired.
I thought they wouldn't like you.
I'd recommend that you try to take it easy.
Why do you want this?
I have a lot of books in my room.
I'll talk to Tom when he gets home.
Tom has started making mistakes.
It's very small.
Do you not like Tom?
Were you the one who helped Tom?
Let's not panic.
I want to be here with you.
She wrapped herself in a blanket.
Tom bumped his head on the roof of the car.
I wasn't told the reason.
I'm not going to tell you why.
We haven't even discussed that.
We knew you could do it.
I think our best days are ahead of us.
I can't live without you.
I can't believe Tom.
Tom is on the list.
Tom and Mary saw a giraffe and her baby.
Where will I live?
I don't know who those people are.
There are too many commercials on TV.
Why are you taking pictures?
I'm free every day but Monday.
Tom said that Mary seldom cries.
It's finally starting to make sense to me.
Tom was impressed with that.
He left his wife.
Tom should've said no.
"I'm flattered, Tom said sarcastically."
Why are you calling me?
It's good that the horse didn't suffer.
Tom could help you.
What time do you think he'll come back?
I thought you said it was yours.
Did you have a dog when you were growing up?
"I've had my ups and downs, but I've always managed to pull myself together."
He washes the car every week.
It's hot in Kyoto in the summer.
I felt my way to the door.
Where did Tom buy that hat?
What I can do for you?
I would like to go home now.
Tom asked Mary if he could kiss her.
Tom doesn't like to talk about it.
I'm not going to talk about that.
Your shoes are dirty.
I don't remember you at all.
I know you had to do that.
Were you crying?
It took me ages to pack up my suitcases.
You'll go far.
He is the boy who painted this picture.
Tom taught Mary how to bake bread.
I probably worry too much.
Tom got out of the pool.
What makes you think Tom will be late?
I was hired.
Write everything down.
I wasn't talking.
Tom is working fast.
I know that already.
Tom doesn't want to live in the country.
Traditional Japanese sweets really do go well with Japanese tea.
I fell asleep in the middle of the lecture.
Mary is in love with a handsome boy from her class named Tom.
I used to go to school with him.
We don't know exactly what Tom did.
Have you ever fallen down the stairs?
Tom knew everyone.
"How's your ulcer, Tom?"
Tom was expecting that.
You never remember my name.
Do you think we could do that?
Tom isn't as tired as we are.
I didn't know you cooked.
That won't work.
Say it in English.
Turn the music down.
They left the problem unsolved.
"Take it away, please."
These shoes are too tight. They hurt.
Here's a list of things that Tom needs to do.
Have you seen the Grand Canyon?
When can you do that?
"You're not Canadian, are you?"
I've already read it.
Tom can help you out.
My salary is very low.
Good-looking people are good-looking no matter what they wear.
I don't know anything about that.
I don't think that we have enough money.
Tom ate the apple you gave him.
He is about your age.
I drank a lot of beer.
He was deeply moved by the story.
How do you like your new class?
Our school begins at eight.
Please speak to me in French.
Don't follow me.
Tom is indiscreet.
"I'm sorry, but I already have other plans."
I suspect you don't need to do that.
Tom and Mary almost never argue.
Have you read the book yet?
Don't work so much.
Tom is bald.
I'm not ugly.
I knew you two would hit it off.
Excuse me a moment.
I want to read it.
Didn't you know Tom was in Australia last winter?
Who'll be the first to die?
Tom pushed Mary away.
Tell me what your address is.
I wonder if that's Tom.
We waited for you.
You should get to school.
We played basketball in the gym.
He gave in to the temptation.
Close the window.
Why am I still doing this?
Do you still love me?
Do you live in Boston?
Tom has been working here for over three years.
Tom thinks he knows everything.
Tom doesn't know whether Mary will come or not.
He makes it a rule never to speak badly of others.
You can't smoke here.
I thought that it had started to rain.
I'm easygoing.
She looked up at the sky.
She mistook my brother for me.
Who cares what Tom thinks?
I didn't think about that.
Tom and I argue a lot.
I didn't want Tom to go.
Let's talk about Boston.
Happiness is more important than wealth.
Tom is always drunk.
Tom takes care of his sick father.
I think that Tom likes Mary.
Are you pleased with your new house?
Rainy season has begun.
Tom is waiting for a tow truck.
I didn't want to humiliate Tom.
Tom and Mary are going to get married soon.
Tom doesn't like cops.
"I'm sorry, but I don't understand English well."
Keeping a diary is a good habit.
How do you take your coffee?
I don't know any of her students.
You are not Japanese.
I'm not strange.
Do you like my new shirt?
"Tom will win, I'm sure."
I sometimes have trouble remembering things.
I was happy then.
How long have you been working here?
That man loves my sister.
It looks like Tom is going to get married.
I see no other alternative.
I'll be there after breakfast.
"Are you frightened, Tom?"
We meet here once a month.
Could I just ask one simple question?
Tom came up with a good idea.
Don't compare yourself to others.
Let's drink one more bottle of wine.
I have three grown sons.
She is looking forward to her birthday party.
She showed us a beautiful hat.
She moved here from Mexico five years ago.
Tom's fat.
You're missing the bigger picture.
How many people did you invite?
Are your bags in the car?
I don't know what could've happened to it.
It's every man for himself.
I don't think Tom has a lot of money.
I like your city.
You make me blush.
Do you have a place to stay tonight?
Tom has already been caught.
We've both seen it.
Tom's field of study is law.
You can't just stand there and watch Tom die.
I didn't tell everyone.
My sister often cries.
I hate weddings.
Who wants this one?
You are such a liar.
How many times have you visited Australia?
They're going to arrest you.
I wonder if I'll ever get married.
I want to tell you about my problems.
Maybe you should have a talk with Tom.
We should be together.
I'm not a kid anymore.
I want you to do me a favor.
I'm not blaming anyone.
How did you get my address?
Tom is the one you need to talk to.
I always get nervous just before a match.
This wasn't your fault.
May I ask you some questions?
What would you do if you had a billion dollars?
Tom tore Mary's picture up.
Tom loves taking pictures.
I saw his face in the dim light.
Tom can use my bicycle if he wants.
I saw you with Tom last Monday.
I should've told Tom to wait.
She tried to hide her mistake from us.
I told her that she was right.
There are a lot of factories in Kawasaki.
Tom doesn't have a bank account.
What song was Tom singing?
What's it made of?
The coast is clear.
Tom rents a three-room apartment.
He has a very vivid imagination.
Where will you have lunch today?
It's a good idea to wash new clothes before wearing them.
Do you know who won?
"This is for you, Tom."
Did he fail again?
He has lied to me again and again.
I don't want to ever see you again.
We don't have any strawberry ice cream.
Tom never asked how Mary had died.
I'll go and buy some chocolate.
Everything was the way I left it.
Tom never was shy.
You should go and have your hair cut.
Tom told us about his life in Boston.
That's incredible.
Tom was a double agent.
"I thought that I saw Tom in the park, but it was someone else."
Shut the gate.
This is obviously fake.
I speak French with Tom and Mary.
Tom will be alright.
We need to know what happened.
"My husband makes 100,000 euros per year."
Christmas is just a week away.
Didn't Tom tell you that we'd be late?
Corporal punishment is forbidden in Sweden.
How many teachers do you know?
I'm aware of the problem.
I need some help.
I think you know that's impossible.
Tom said Mary was a stewardess.
"Tom, Mary, John and Alice are all Canadians."
Don't go too far away from camp.
I'm an assistant.
"I'd like to tell you, but I can't."
I'm glad you didn't do it.
Tom knows the situation well enough.
Tom taught us a lot.
The baby was sleeping soundly in his mother's arms.
You got off easy.
Tom is no longer able to help us.
Tom asked Mary to take John to the airport.
You're splitting hairs.
Please hurry up.
What are you looking for in the darkroom?
Whose plan is it?
This is the reason why I came here.
Tom walked out of the meeting.
Tom should've done this yesterday.
What does Tom mean?
I just dropped in to say goodbye.
I'll let you know in a day or so.
Do you let your children drink coffee?
It was fun.
My name is third on the list.
Tom likes Swiss cheese.
I'm lucky I'm alive.
Tom is my oldest brother.
"You will keep your word, won't you?"
How did you and Tom become acquainted?
Now give it back.
"If you'd like to study French with a native speaker, please contact me."
How else can I help you?
I want to know who sent you.
I thought they were wrong.
I feel like going outside.
That's just not enough.
Come fishing with me.
Tom and Mary talked for hours.
Let's go back to Australia together.
Most of it's in French.
That's a beautiful name.
We like to drink a cup of coffee after eating lunch.
You should apologize for your rudeness.
Perhaps it'll rain tomorrow.
Would you give me the recipe for your salad?
You aren't allowed to take photographs.
I know nothing about him.
They had nothing.
"Tom is a very talented musician, too."
I don't know how much it cost.
Did I tell you that already?
I'll be there in a moment.
I want to see my son.
Tom was working at his desk all morning.
Tom waited in the car.
Don't get too cocky.
Tom walks very slowly.
I'm grateful for Tom's help.
I like the color of your skirt.
Tom has no desire to do that.
Stay here.
Try not to forget anything.
Tom told me he had a knife.
She must've been beautiful when she was young.
Neither of us wants to do that today.
You didn't tell me.
We associate Darwin's name with the theory of evolution.
You'll never know unless you try.
Tom studied French.
He demanded payment of the debt.
This one's different.
It hurts to move.
Did you understand what I said?
How many times have you tried to fix this?
I'm not one of them.
I can't confirm that.
Tom is not famous.
Why did you lie about your age?
How can you be so cruel?
Tom avoided Mary.
I can't tell you what happened.
I think you're on the right track.
You know that I'm telling the truth.
I think your work is very good.
I'm going to bed.
Has anybody here been to Boston?
Tom has already had lunch.
Are you mentally ill?
How was lunch?
About how long will it take?
Didn't you know that Tom was going to be in Boston this week?
I've never seen you like this.
Does Tom know that you're going to do that?
"Is Tom a doctor? ""Yes, he is."""
Tom left his coat downstairs.
Do you know where Tom is now?
What can I do to help you?
We haven't done anything yet.
Tom taught French for many years.
Just go home.
"You're avoiding me, aren't you?"
They're probably scared.
Keep your money in a safe place.
You never said goodbye.
Your job is to find it.
Tom didn't know who to trust.
"He tried to catch the bird, but couldn't."
I want you to stay here until I get back.
You look like you're about to cry.
Where did you stay?
Tom doesn't yet know what I want to do.
Please count your change again.
Tom said he loved me.
I think that Tom will be able to do that.
We're redoubling our efforts.
Tom was allowed to sleep.
They lost again.
All the leaves on the tree turned yellow.
I don't think that I'd like to live in Boston.
Tom was chuckling.
I just want you to quit talking for a minute.
They wrote letters to each other frequently.
Wait until I finish eating.
I didn't expect Tom and Mary to be here.
My uncle lived abroad for many years.
I thought you didn't have any money.
Tom doesn't know Mary lives here.
I don't think they'll accept these conditions.
Everybody wanted to dance.
Tom wants to be admired.
I'm at school now.
Have I offended you?
I've already thanked Tom.
I don't know who I should ask.
I didn't mean anything by that.
Tom fastened his seatbelt.
It is stipulated that we should receive a month's vacation every year.
"You're alone, aren't you?"
We only have half a tank of gas left.
How about a beer?
"You're three years older than Tom, aren't you?"
I can't believe I'm doing this.
Is it true you can't speak French?
"If I were in your place, I would lend him a hand."
Tom lived alone in a small hut.
Is sugar cane a fruit?
I'm reading the newspaper.
You take this one.
The colony has not declared independence as yet.
Tom kept his hat on.
I don't feel like doing it today.
Do you think Tom's telling the truth?
Tom divided the pie into three equal parts.
Neither Tom nor Mary went to school yesterday.
"What do you want? ""I want a dog."""
Tom wanted to show you something.
I don't think we need that.
I come from a small town in Australia.
Tom knows that I don't often win.
Could you put my name on the waiting list?
This lake is the deepest in Japan.
I'm Tom's new partner.
I thanked Tom for the flowers.
I will wait outside.
Can you see them?
I don't like the people I work with.
Tom didn't go alone.
I thought that you wanted to see me.
Tom was easy to talk to.
Why are you always so serious?
Are you planning to go to Boston with Tom?
Tom and three other people were injured.
You're too naive.
Didn't I tell you to close the door?
What pretty flowers!
Origami is the art of folding paper.
She's not a doctor.
You still haven't told me where you live.
You've misunderstood me.
Help yourself to more cookies.
We couldn't protect Tom.
Tom said that he was lucky.
Have you ever heard Tom sing before?
What should I do in the meantime?
This is so boring.
I can't tell you about it.
Are you courageous?
Tom and I know who did that.
Is it dirty?
Tom listened to Mary patiently.
Tom didn't even have the decency to apologize.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
Tom and I have both done that.
I don't want to kiss you.
Tom didn't write back to Mary.
Tell Tom that I'm going to do that today.
I wrote that for Tom.
When did Tom and Mary get married?
I'll order food.
One of my brothers plays the bassoon.
I saw you flirting with Tom.
This isn't likely to change.
I didn't actually agree to do that.
Tom is my French teacher.
I am right for once.
You see everything in terms of money.
Don't get me started.
I really need this job.
Why have you been avoiding me?
Why can't you stay with Tom?
Tom spent all day trying to fix the leak in the roof.
I knew you were sick.
You should give Tom some time.
Did you give Tom my phone number?
She touched him on the shoulder.
I don't want you to wake him up.
What else do you have?
You can keep the change.
Tom wants us to follow him.
You need to walk away.
Someone tried to poison you.
I can't explain.
I'll phone you as soon as I get to the airport.
I'll call you a taxi.
I know that you're in love with me.
That store sells all kinds of things.
We just landed.
You've come too early.
I won't lie.
When was the last time you asked someone for help?
Your plan worked.
"Heads I win, tails you lose."
You're desperate.
I knew you'd ask about that.
Tom didn't have the courage to admit that he had made a mistake.
Don't give Tom my address.
Tom spends way too much time thinking about Mary.
You have to face the facts.
I would've done that if my parents had let me.
Tom asked Mary what her sisters' names were.
Is the road wide enough for two-way traffic?
I knew you'd never let Tom die.
Which of your parents do you think you look like?
I wish I hadn't told Tom to show Mary how to do that.
It was a shock.
Who's that letter from?
You're the one who must decide.
Tom blamed Mary.
Tom is mentioned in the book.
What else have you got?
This is way too difficult for me.
Take this one.
I think it's going to work.
It looks like you're in a good mood.
Tom didn't realize he'd made a mistake.
Leave it up to me. I'll take care of everything.
Tom has never done anything like that.
I thought we should go.
Tom pried up the floorboards looking for the hidden gold coins.
Tom watched Mary swim.
I left the room.
Tom pushed the chair away.
"When my wife finds out, she won't be happy."
Tom knew what was hidden in the cave.
Try to calm down.
I ate absolutely nothing the whole day.
Tom didn't know whether he should do that or not.
I'm glad you're here.
They resolved to work harder.
I think you've been in Boston a little too long.
When does the restaurant open?
I didn't even know his name.
It wasn't as expensive as I thought it would be.
"Your name is Tom, isn't it?"
"You speak French, right?"
Are you going to ask Tom or not?
We were here all night.
"No matter what you may say, I will not change my mind."
The children were sitting around the campfire singing songs.
What are you going to do about it?
I want you to explain it to me in more detail.
I locked myself in the bathroom.
The small dog tried to get away.
I'm only three blocks away.
My head is spinning.
Don't resist us.
Have you already been to Boston?
I saw the girls pick the wild flowers.
Please wait here for a while.
Could you dim the lights a little?
How much money did you spend?
What was the diagnosis?
I'm sick and tired of being lonely.
I didn't recognize him at first.
We're very close friends.
She regrets having never been there.
I know exactly where I am.
I like math best.
You won't believe what I found today.
Tom is a wealthy businessman.
I don't think I'll be able to win.
Tom thought you were in Australia.
I sometimes help Tom in the garden.
My older brother is a very good person.
I think you'd better come back home.
I will sue you.
Tom is running a little behind schedule.
Why don't you want to talk to Tom?
Tom poisoned his neighbor's dog.
She turned around and smiled.
Tom couldn't remember where he hid the map.
I knew you'd ask about that.
I'm a vegan.
I didn't feel like going out.
You had no right to do that.
It's not ready yet.
It looks like Tom will be late.
How long did the movie last?
Tom couldn't find it.
I'm sure Tom will want to go with us.
Tom is the only one here who can speak French.
There's no escape.
Do you know where that happened?
Put the book back where you found it.
He discussed the problem with his son.
I talked on the phone.
Why is everyone laughing?
Do we have to tell Tom?
"Yes, I have a good idea."
Tom knew that Mary was rich.
Who painted this painting?
That watch is less expensive than this one.
Tom is behind Mary.
He will come back at four.
I think Tom looks a lot like John.
That is mine. I don't know where yours is.
Tom doesn't need to go there if he doesn't want to.
The dogs were happy.
You're wrong about that.
It's never safe.
What can you do for me?
Who told you I was rich?
I have good news.
I wasn't very interested in what Tom was talking about.
I politely declined Tom's invitation.
This land is your land.
Nobody knew that except Tom.
Do you mind if I join you?
I'll do that if Tom pays me.
Hundreds of people work in this factory.
We all know that no one is perfect.
"If you have a problem, ask Tom for help."
You've done a very good job.
You must be starving.
I've been waiting for this moment.
How could Tom know?
He was tenacious.
Tom didn't die right away.
A fish swims by moving its tail.
You're a loser.
I just lost my job.
I don't like this game.
I never imagined meeting you here.
You must give up smoking.
I was caught in a shower.
Didn't you know that you needed a visa?
I'm sure Tom is suffering.
How could I have known?
I can't promise you that I'll do that.
I cooked breakfast for you.
Have you tried the chicken?
We have an important meeting next week to prepare for.
Why did you kiss Tom?
We found it hard to change the plan.
I'm well aware of the risk.
There was a big fire last night.
I'm not sure how to pronounce this word.
Mary redid her lipstick.
My sister jogs every day.
Tom opened another bottle of wine.
Can I stay and help?
We are always exposed to some kind of danger.
You're not an idiot.
Our team won 3 to 1.
There's no water in the pool.
Nobody ever listens.
We complained to the manager about the noise next door.
Tom will be going to Boston with Mary.
I took a taxi because the bus was late.
I'll come right to the point.
"Tom wanted to go, but he didn't."
The air is fresh in the morning.
I'm the one who takes out the garbage.
Let us know whether you can come.
Give me the pencil.
How soon will you be leaving?
The author doesn't display much talent in his book.
Tom shut the TV off.
Maybe what I want doesn't matter anymore.
Let's try to understand one another.
Have you ever opened this door?
Don't touch the button.
I heard that Tom got married.
I won the election.
Tom probably walked home by himself.
I won't lend Tom any money.
I'm the boss.
You're a woman.
What am I to do next?
Tom is better looking than John.
You can't leave.
Tom admitted that he'd been drinking.
What can you tell us?
They took the subway.
Accidents have increased in number.
Alexander Hamilton was a proud man.
Words failed him.
We need to finish the job.
Do you know where we're going?
I know that you like me.
We have offered help.
I immediately knew my leg was broken.
What did they hit you with?
Give Tom my thanks.
"Don't tell me, tell Tom."
We won't get caught.
Tom asked me what I had been doing.
I wish I could believe you.
If you do that you'll leave yourself wide open.
"Today, everything went awry from the start."
Tom said that Mary agreed.
The road was muddy and slippery.
You're ugly.
They probably didn't hear you.
You have great legs.
What's the name of the place?
I'd like a cup of coffee.
I have no idea what to do.
What are you implying?
Tom said that he couldn't wait much longer.
Today's paper says that a typhoon is coming.
Can you ride a bicycle?
We have to give Tom more time.
Radishes aren't difficult to grow.
It is not cold today.
Tom dreamed about winning.
I'm old enough to be your father.
I returned to my hometown after five years' absence.
This couch is not comfortable.
"When his wife died, he received dozens of condolence cards."
We won't wait for you.
Tom is the best.
Tom didn't bother to answer.
I had never had that problem before.
I recommend that you don't do that again.
What is it you want to do?
Can you tell them I'm not in?
Did Tom say why he wanted to borrow the truck?
What do you see here?
Where are you going exactly?
I wanted to help Tom build his house.
I didn't tell Tom what he wanted to know.
Tom is my father.
There's someone waiting for you in the lobby.
Tom's cat is dead.
You may quote me.
You don't seem to be very tired.
"If I could go anywhere in the world, I'd go to Australia."
May I write it in pencil?
Tom has probably never eaten dog meat.
Tom and I usually speak to each other in French.
This book is even more interesting than that one.
Tom sat three tables away from us.
Please don't be afraid of me.
You should've talked to Tom first.
One more thing. If you try anything on Mayu I'll break your spine.
The only language that Tom can speak is French.
Are you nervous?
You're risking your career.
I hate being single.
Tom has a scar on his arm.
I saw it.
Are you healthy?
What's the difference between asteroids and comets?
Who's the woman with the red hat?
We can't survive without food.
Tom isn't wearing shoes.
Would anyone else like to speak?
Tom often drank chocolate milk when he was a kid.
I don't need them.
Tom was only thirteen years old when he came to Boston.
They're awake.
I'm not sure anymore.
Do you want to know why I quit?
Which one would you take?
The wind has abated.
I hope we beat Tom.
"You'll have to row the boat, too."
This is your decision.
I wish I had a camera.
That's what Tom and I are trying to do.
Sometimes my hands shake.
Are you with Tom?
I thought that everyone knew.
Sit up straight in your chair.
I've already told Tom what I need to do.
"You think I kissed Mary, don't you?"
"You still haven't done that, have you?"
Whether we go or not depends on the weather.
I wanted to give Tom a chance.
You have to unpack your luggage for customs inspection.
I encouraged Tom to learn French.
Guess what I found.
"Fortunately, Tom recovered."
Have you been married for a long time?
I need a new toothbrush.
I'm no fool.
We'll talk again.
I like Tom. He's a nice guy.
I want you to leave now.
"You didn't sing, did you?"
Tom is usually quite patient.
Do you want me to talk to Tom about what's going to happen?
Close the blinds.
Tom woke up the next day with a painful hangover.
She will pay for everything.
He always plans a thing out carefully before he does it.
Keep your shoulders straight.
Please show me your stamp album.
"Come over here, Tom."
Tom is one of our best workers.
How many people are on the list now?
Is that a friend of yours?
It's across the street.
Is that what you want me to say?
May I ask you something?
I won't have enough time to do that today.
I don't want to move back to Australia.
I had finished my homework when you called me.
I found the pencil I lost.
Tom isn't that type of guy.
I'd like to know more about you.
You should've told me sooner.
Tom had a pistol.
I'm amazed Tom is still alive.
We're on the right track.
Keep working.
I'm a Christian.
That's your decision.
I thought we could talk.
I'll ask around and let you know what I find out.
I think I can help.
Do you know how much strawberries cost right now?
I spoke with Tom's assistant.
Are you hiring?
How does he make money?
I'm not suggesting you go alone.
I'm sorry to bother you again.
This car has a cigarette lighter.
It was very nice seeing you again.
I'm surprised Tom remembers us.
Tom arrived early this morning.
Will you pass me the salt?
I can't believe you did that by yourself.
Aren't you a little young?
Who do you think will win the race?
"Get off your high horse, Tom."
It's not you I'm worried about.
You're blushing.
We'll be living in Boston.
My room is very messy.
I am not writing a letter.
I left three questions unanswered.
We have a cat and a dog.
It wasn't funny at all.
We need more food.
I'm not as good at speaking French as Tom.
You can park behind the hotel.
I thought it might be you.
What's your favorite alcoholic beverage?
I knew we would find it.
"How do you say ""love"" in French?"
I'll help you wash the car.
Gold is much more expensive than silver.
I thought Tom might ask Mary to the dance.
It takes time.
My father lectured me for smoking.
I want to hear the truth.
You're still here.
Didn't you know Tom didn't want to do that?
"Which is quicker, a taxi or the subway?"
I would really like to learn more about your country.
I have no problem with my boss.
Let's watch TV here.
That country's economy is growing.
We'll have to postpone the game.
Tom's house is near the beach.
"Due to unforeseen circumstances, our trip to the mountains this weekend will be cancelled."
I saw them enter the bank.
Don't come again.
What are Tom's hobbies?
This isn't a school.
They weren't hungry.
I live by myself.
You'd better ask Tom.
Put your mask on.
They're pretty loud.
Please stay with me a while longer.
Change is inevitable.
I don't have to stand for such insolence on Tom's part.
I think that you should buy yourselves some new clothes.
This is the most beautiful country I have ever visited.
Tom gave the waiter a very good tip.
I'll help you as much as I can.
Do you think I still love her?
Tom is not likely to follow our advice.
I couldn't find it.
I was born in this hospital.
I thought I was never going to see you again.
I learned that from you.
I don't know whether he's younger or older than I am.
I know that Tom helped you.
Which instruments do you play?
Excuse the mess.
Tom probably shouldn't tell Mary about the accident.
It seems that we've lost our way.
I knew this moment would come.
Tom would surely agree.
He and only he knows the whole truth.
"You recognize her, don't you?"
He's been teaching for 20 years.
Tom hesitated for a second.
Tom wiped the sweat off his face.
Aren't you going to go?
I met my teacher on the way to the railway station.
We have no classes on Wednesday afternoons.
I would do it again.
Tom is kidding.
She put the money in the bank.
He lives in a large house.
I was completely wrong.
Nobody knows what will happen next.
I can run as fast as Tom can.
Tom covered his face.
I love to walk along the river in the mornings.
Can Mars be colonized?
Close the door on your way out.
I don't laugh very often.
I'm a nurse.
Is it OK if I stay in Australia for another week?
I can get you fired.
Tom has never broken the law.
My wife died three years ago.
I'm looking forward to going hunting with my father.
I'll wait for you downstairs.
"Hey, can I help?"
Everyone makes mistakes sometimes.
His answer was to strike me on the head.
We'll try not to let that happen.
I can't go into detail.
You should eat something before you go.
I am 30 years old now.
He was killed in the earthquake.
You don't need my permission.
Who did this first?
Take notes.
Why hasn't Tom come back yet?
I'm not always busy in the morning.
Didn't you know Tom knew how to do that?
That's a pretty dress.
Aren't you going to vote today?
I'm not a marathon runner.
You should ask Tom.
Mind if I join you guys?
Marriage is a lottery.
"It's really unbelievable, isn't it?"
He was hit by a car.
You said you wanted to talk to me.
The price of that book is five dollars.
Don't leave everything to chance.
Give it a whirl.
I'm certain that Tom will be there.
How much did it cost?
Tom is on the bus.
I hope Tom stays in Boston.
Do you know where you want to go?
Does Tom have it?
You can tell Tom.
Just keep talking.
Tom never listens to Mary.
I was leaving for Paris the next morning.
Did you help Tom?
What do you know about love?
You must learn English whether you like it or not.
Tom told me Mary was retired.
Who were the original people here?
Did you lie to Tom?
Please don't speak so fast.
I'm going to be OK.
That's what saved me.
Maybe we should ask someone for directions.
Tom knew what Mary knew.
I totally agree with you.
"I'd like a sandwich, please."
You can't get a job here without a work permit.
Do you really want to go?
I'm not sure what Tom meant by that.
Is it a trap?
It is no use worrying about it.
"Apparently, Tom and I were wrong."
You should eat more.
"Tell me what's wrong, Tom."
We don't need your help.
Who told you where to find me?
I wanted to go to the concert.
How fast were you driving?
Are you afraid of it?
I never should've done that.
I'm the one who broke that window.
I plan to wear a black tie.
Tom told me you used to live in Australia.
It is getting lighter outside.
I wanted to hear you say that.
The police recovered the stolen jewelry.
I'd rather she sat next to me.
I don't care about your past.
"No matter how many people tell him he made a mistake, Tom still insists he's right."
No one says that.
They don't usually take hostages.
I don't even want to think about what could happen.
He returned from the office.
He's in a good mood today.
This is totally unacceptable.
Am I wasting my time?
I think that you're right.
I want to know why you didn't call me back.
There was no hurry.
Tom did that for his kids.
Honesty is very important.
That's the only thing that's important.
I am going to try to get a good tan.
My sister likes Tom.
The kitten couldn't get down from the tree.
You can't let other people make your decisions for you.
I think we're ready to go there.
"Personally, I don't like it."
I know I can count on all of you.
I wish you hadn't seen that.
Please remove this.
I have to work now.
Can you tell me more about your family?
I should tell Tom everything.
"Tom broke up with Mary before her birthday, so he wouldn't have to buy her a present."
Tom is knocking.
The fish was very fresh.
Where's Mary's purse?
Tom will definitely do that.
Tom says he doesn't want to be a janitor anymore.
I do believe you.
I cannot put up with his arrogance.
I don't know a lot of jokes.
Did you see where Tom hid it?
What station is it?
It's probably just the wind.
There's something I need to do this afternoon.
We totally forgot about lunch.
His proposal started a debate that lasted a year.
I prefer milk to juice.
How much will it cost to build?
I baked some cookies for Tom.
I want to talk to Tom first.
I'd like to get off at the next stop.
"I want to go with you, but I'm broke."
I'd do anything to protect Tom.
How long have Tom and Mary been engaged?
Our shop will be closed on Monday.
She's not confident about the future.
Where did I put the keys?
There was no one on the beach.
Who sings that song?
I thought you said that Tom and Mary were married.
Tom wasn't having much luck.
I expect him to come.
I'm sure Tom knows what to do.
They sent up a balloon.
Tom didn't want me to kiss him.
I wanted to say that I'm sorry.
I think Tom will be bored.
Please wait here.
I gave Tom your address.
"I went to bed, but I couldn't fall asleep."
Tell me more about this.
He began to work for that company last year.
I think I'd want to know.
Tom is something of a celebrity.
I've come to ask you a question.
How many hours did it take Tom to do that?
The sun sends out an incredible amount of heat and light.
The murderer hasn't been arrested yet.
I'm not sure if Tom will go.
I felt completely happy.
May I open my eyes now?
He nodded to me.
She made him a new suit.
Tom took out after Mary.
My shoes are dirty.
Writing is easy. All you have to do is cross out the wrong words.
We know you're a vegetarian.
Tom has the same sweater as you.
There's a big crack in the wall.
Tom told me that I need to go to today's meeting.
Why do you think that's a good idea?
It's not as big a problem as you think.
How do you get to work?
He was sick last week.
Do you think you're funny?
I'm bored right now.
We have plans to do that.
I'd like to have a word with you.
Tom is a man of his word.
I wish you'd waited.
I've got nothing else to do.
You'll be free.
"Recently, I don't have much appetite."
Can I come in for a few minutes?
I'll show you what I can do.
I knew you wouldn't forget Tom.
May I go now?
"Could I speak to Tom, please?"
Tom wanted to see you.
There is a lot of furniture in this room.
Our teacher comes to school by car.
Do you remember the name of the paramedic that saved my life?
I said get back!
Clean the window.
I want a house.
Tom watched a YouTube video on how to eat a pomegranate.
Call your brother.
Are you listening to the radio?
Are you sure you heard something?
I'm at the restaurant.
You need to make a choice.
I wasn't sure I could do it.
Tom doesn't let his children drink wine.
I don't think that's Tom's handwriting.
Tom was working as hard as possible.
Tom tripped Mary.
What room is Tom in?
That house is much better than this.
Tom stays in touch with Mary.
What's your explanation?
Please remain seated until the bus stops completely.
The pain was excruciating.
They raised their glasses and toasted to their success.
We closed the restaurant three hours early yesterday.
Does Tom still have a crush on Mary?
He is by far the best baseball player at our school.
I don't think that I should ask Tom to do that for us.
We didn't go to Boston with Tom.
Tom brushed his daughter's hair.
I love her so much I could die.
Why do people dye their hair?
I need to concentrate.
Tom made a wise decision.
Are you sure you want to go with Tom?
I don't know when I'll return.
I consider myself one of you.
He's a cardiologist.
The work will take anywhere from two to three weeks.
It's a pity that Tom is leaving.
I want to send a telegram.
She doesn't want to play with her toys.
I think that we should go back to Boston.
She taught music for thirty years.
I'm not as rich as you are.
I wish you two the best.
I was at the wrong place at the wrong time.
Are you healthy?
That's up to you.
I thought that you'd want to go to the concert with us.
Tom isn't my father. He's my uncle.
I want you to promise me that.
What happened to the money I gave you?
I have an explanation.
Tom became suspicious.
Did you speak to anybody?
I don't know what you've heard.
I knew you'd find it.
I went to a shoe store yesterday.
Mother was very busy most of the time.
Nobody is in the classroom now.
"With his mother very sick and a tight deadline at work, Tom has a lot on his plate at the moment."
Tom told Mary to study harder.
Has Tom ever been to Australia?
These suitcases are heavy.
They're about to leave.
Tom's shoes are too big for him.
"We can't leave our tents on the beach where they are now. If we do, they'll be under water during high tide."
Will you stay at home tonight?
Tom is already really good at French.
The bus was crowded.
Tom is crazy about Mary.
He lived in the center of London.
Tom was asking about you.
You're too tense.
Tom didn't eat the sandwich I made for him.
Why are you in such a bad mood this evening?
I'll be at Tom's.
Who gave Tom so much money?
I can feel it.
I remember your father.
You're always laughing.
I have to print 100 pages.
Don't you like swimming?
I'd like to call Tom and see if he can come visit me tomorrow.
Have you spoken with Tom yet?
Didn't you know that that would happen?
I get depressed sometimes.
I'll make sure Tom isn't late.
I heard you were here yesterday.
The cows are milked at six.
It looks perfect.
Tom is used to living alone.
I didn't want to spend my whole life there.
My answer was correct.
I found the book very interesting.
Their patience was about to give out.
Send it by mail.
You'd better change your way of thinking.
Some economists think so.
Don't say things like that.
He is not what he was.
I think this is too expensive.
Tell me what you mean.
Excuse me just a moment.
Don't call Tom names.
Light travels much faster than sound.
Do you really want to do that today?
The budget of the film was very limited.
I don't like to sit too close to the screen.
The cat is dead.
We thought you knew.
They needed more time.
That's a very interesting story.
I had many friends when I was living in Boston.
Tom saw the lights in the distance.
I work in Boston.
I'm going to be sick.
What's this computer doing here?
Has anyone told Tom about what happened?
Haven't I told you never to call me here?
I noticed you weren't at home last night.
I feel seasick.
I just got a call from your school.
You're a soldier now.
This is Tom's wife.
Your new school doesn't have a swimming pool.
I didn't understand you.
This restaurant never closes.
May I eat something?
She married again in her mid-forties.
Tom put down his glass.
Tom changed the sheets on his bed.
I needed to get some air.
Have you seen this already?
I feel so lonely sometimes.
I like trying new things.
He wrote to me yesterday.
I don't believe you just said that.
I guess we have no choice.
Are you a fan?
Do you bake every day?
We expected Tom to win.
Why wasn't I told about this?
I remember the day I met you.
Tom put the gun to his head.
Did Tom answer all your questions?
Tom is incredibly good-looking.
The wind blew too hard for them to play in the park.
Is there anything I can do for you?
Don't be so choosy.
He shows interest in winter sports.
The man claimed he didn't take the money.
Tom is a member of this club.
My father has given up smoking recently.
He did the right thing.
Tom gave me his phone number and told me to call him.

That is his car.
She is wearing a blue dress.
Did I do something to make Tom angry?

You are not our friend.

Write it in pencil.
Sit on the sofa and make yourself comfortable.

I am often mistaken.
He stayed out of public life.
I'm coming with you.
Tom didn't like what Mary cooked.
How about a game of darts?
Find out who Tom has been talking to.
Tom speaks fast.
It's clear Tom took the wrong bus.
I wonder what made Tom think Mary will be able to do that.
I'm sorry if I frightened you.
He's now on the phone.
I think we're done here.
Tom wants Mary to know that he loves her.
That happens to me all the time.
May I borrow your pencil?
A car hit Tom.
I'm a childhood friend of Tom's.
Tom was deep in thought.
Who did you go with?
How did you get home yesterday?
I hid in the attic.
I don't like you and Tom.
Tom hasn't been fired yet.
Can anyone explain this to me?
I didn't know you were Canadian.
I'll never be late again.
I won't bother you again.
She came with good news.
You should have replied to his letter.
He left his daughter a great fortune.
Did Tom reply?
What's the most logical explanation?
His eyesight is failing.
Tom is doing everything he can for Mary.
The picture was wonderful.
That store sells men's wear.
Your efforts came to nothing.
I always drink a glass of milk before going to sleep.
Tom doesn't know what I did.
I did everything I could do.
Do you want me to open a window?
He was unaware of the situation.
Tom said Mary wouldn't cry.
Are your bags in the car?
Tom almost never wins at chess.
They've cut down most of the trees for firewood.
Tom wants to come over after work.
Do you know how fast you were going?
Why do you need a new television?
Tom looks like he's ready to cry.
It's too bad you're leaving.
I don't want you to quit your job.
I don't remember putting it there.
I never saw Tom again.
There's something on your neck.
They didn't seem to know French.
We're approaching the rendezvous point.
We're overreacting.
He must have seen it.
"Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you."
How long are you going to be there?
It makes no difference whether you go or not.
Did you lose?
Would you wait if you were me?
This is my song.
All three were wounded.
Am I too early?
I forgot something. I'll be right back.
How much tea do you drink?
We didn't buy it.
You're a brave person.
Would you mind leaving me alone?
I told you Tom wouldn't want to go.
I'll come if necessary.
I was hoping I was wrong.
I don't know Tom well enough to dislike him yet.
I don't want to get involved.
You wouldn't survive.
You don't have much time.
I think Tom swears too much.
May I call at around 2:30?
I was the first to begin speaking.
Don't you want to talk to me?
I know I'm crazy.
I think that won't be easy to do.
Don't worry. You'll make it.
Please remember to mail the letters.
Tom didn't even want to talk to Mary.
Where did you go yesterday?
Tom said he was completely exhausted.
Don't you know what it is?
Tom sold his farm and moved to Boston.
Tom read the note.
Give Tom the $300.
I know you don't care about Tom.
This is a picture painted by him.
I thought that you could speak French.
I feel like I've already been here sometime.
I found out something about Tom.
Why are you so happy today?
Tom probably knows I like him.
You'll have to ask Tom.
Take command.
"That job was not very interesting, but on the other hand it was well paid."
Tom doesn't know when Mary will leave for Boston.
Tom wanted to talk to you.
We've spent a lot of time together.
Your friends are waiting for you.
Please translate this into French.
I have no idea what to do next.
"Tom is still living in Boston, isn't he?"
I can help you now.
Tom doesn't like to eat fish.
I didn't have much lunch.
Tom wore a straw hat.
Money can't buy friends.
We're all in the same boat.
Will you talk to Tom?
I'm thinking of going to Boston next month.
Our house is very small.
Everyone looks exhausted.
I'll never see you again.
Your parents haven't seen you for a long time.
Tom can't wait to get started.
I don't think that I should tell you.
What's the real reason you don't want to do this?
My secretary has a good command of English.
Tomorrow may be too late.
Please continue.
"If I had had more time, I would have written to you."
He's crying.
We have failed.
Do you do that often?
Tom is very handsome.
There's something in here.
Don't give me any lip.
Tom went to Mary's funeral.
Will you tell him about it when he comes home?
Tom began to pray.
Tom bought a bracelet for Mary.
Was Tom wearing a hat?
Look at the moon.
They missed a good chance.
My parrot died yesterday.
Do you already know what to do?
"Where did Tom find it, at school or at home?"
Everyone is in the living room watching TV.
I had to go there by myself.
I hear a strange sound.
Tom isn't very good at remembering names.
My car is parked outside.
Tom can stay with us.
I'd like to be as rich as Tom is.
She needs some help from us.
Answer Tom.
Which one is your favorite?
"I lent him a book, but he has not yet given it back."
I will be waiting for you in my room.
You've made us wait.
Tom started giggling.
I think that we've learned a lot.
How did Tom sleep?
I think you know that isn't true.
Where do you park?
She decided to have surgery.
Don't make me shoot you again.
No one will believe Tom.
"Tom didn't know the meaning of ""anglophobia,"" so he did a quick web search to see if he could find out what it meant."
I knew that Tom would be able to win.
I want to make friends with your sister.
I told Tom to stop.
We're going to Boston to see Tom.
I told Tom that he needed to do that.
I know you can't stop Tom.
Ask before you borrow your sister's clothes.
They congratulated us on our victory.
Someone who looks a lot like Tom is standing near the gate.
There's no denying that I'm attracted to you.
Do you have any siblings?
Stop the engine.
The Thirteenth Amendment freed all Negro slaves.
We started hugging and kissing each other.
Here's a present for you.
Why do you not want to do that?
You're not invited.
You never told me that you liked Tom.
Aren't you Tom's girlfriend?
I have a right to be happy.
I have a couple of friends who used to live in Boston.
The train arrived in London.
Can you show me?
You're on the list.
You're smarter than most of Tom's friends.

Who do you think you are?

That's the standard.
Tom lives upstairs.
Who told you?

We miss you.
I'm a vegetarian.
Tom took a big sip.
I allowed Tom to speak.
I have to study hard to keep up with the other students.
Tom will leave in an hour.
Tom asked Mary what her father's name was.
I think Tom is broad-minded.

What can I say to convince you?
Come early.

We got to the station at six.

You're the only person I can rely on in this kind of situation.

Tom and Mary need your help.
She needs to sleep more.
I need to finish my homework.
Were there any glasses on the table?
Don't change the subject.
Tom isn't in Boston now.
I need an assistant.
Keep searching.
I think that Tom is still sleeping.
I want you to dance.
Tom is still there.
Tom told me you're a doctor.
It was a costly mistake.
Give us a chance.
Wash your hands before you eat.
None of us are perfect.
I need to tell Tom everything.
Tom said that he would do it.
I think it's dangerous to walk alone at night.
I suppose so.
The police are interrogating Tom now.
Why are they smiling?
I had no idea things were so bad.
All of us hope that Tom will be there.
I forgot I was in Australia.
What are my options?
That was a mistake.
They hate each other.
Tom complained about the service.
I had the flu last month.
He advertised his house for sale.

I do what's best for my country.
He killed himself.
Tom got out of the jeep.
I've got to tell Tom.

You promised you'd come.
"Tom is concerned about that, too."

Don't you want me to go with you?
I think you deserve this.
Put it back.

This is not my ticket.
I'm not feeling too well.
I'm happy for the first time in life.
You place me in a difficult position.
I requested extra salt on my french fries.

I didn't know Tom was your grandson.
I was told to leave this alone.
Give me the knife.
I can't allow you to do this.
"Nothing could be done, except wait."
Come closer to me.
I didn't move a muscle.
What Tom predicted would happen has happened.
I don't know where I am exactly.
Tom was out of town last week.
The teacher told me to stand up.
This is a very important message.
I'm trying to find Tom.
I don't think I'll get there on time.
I'll be spending most of my time in Boston the next three months.
It's a matter of the utmost importance.
I climbed a tree.
He's eating lunch now.
I'm quite sure of that.
Do you have a better idea?
Tom realized he was wrong.
Tom suddenly started to cry.
"Tom is still living on Park Street, isn't he?"
We didn't part on very good terms.
Leave the book where it is.
Tom has decided to stay a few more days.
How did they do?
Why is the bus stopping?
It was a good game.
I am from Tokyo.
Did you pay the rent this month?
That isn't the question.
My teacher told me to read as much as I could.
Tom didn't say when he'd do that.
We're not very far from where it happened.
Now I'm wide awake.
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
I haven't even told my wife.
It was this boy that broke the windowpane.
I can't believe it's been a year.
Was that meant as a joke?
I don't know why you don't like him.
Did you change your clothes?
Did Tom study for today's test?
The road is muddy.
I'm a cartoonist.
It's foggy now in Boston.
The bill was passed by an overwhelming majority.
Will this help them?
I can't believe we're doing this.
He was crushed to death.
I know what to expect now.
Tom said that he grew up in Boston.
I almost left my umbrella in the train.
Haven't you finished yet?
That's what I need to find out.
Where were you on the night Tom was murdered?
It was sunny yesterday.
Tom asked us to dinner.
Take your umbrella with you.
Tom said he wouldn't help us anymore.
The question now is who.
Tom wasn't murdered.
Young people are apt to waste time.
Tom is going to be late for school today.
You can rest.
It's time to milk the goats.
I always play by the rules.
I've requested an explanation and I hope I'll get one.
I thought you loved Tom.
You should know by now that I can't speak French very well.
I'll be your friend.
I told Tom I would help them.
I told Tom to come inside.
Tom is different from most people.
Is this my fault?
"I was going to write to you, but I forgot."
Everything's different now.
That's not your problem anymore.
She has beautiful eyes.
I was never in love with you.
Tom took a trip to Boston.
I told Tom that I didn't want to ever see him again.
Twenty years is a long time.
Tom will be greatly missed.
"As soon as he comes back, let me know."
I knew what I was doing.
Whose turn is it to set the table?
They just want an excuse to fire you.
Tom pointed to the back room.
Carry this.
Not everything is black and white.
I'm going to stop smoking.
I knew Tom would get better.
He was blind from birth.
Tom is still interested in buying your old car.
Tom buttoned up his coat.
Tom is getting married.
I just got back three hours ago.
I could find his address.
My hobby is collecting coins.
I thought I was alone here.
We spoke in French.
I was working last night.
It's a secret.
We'll have to finish this later.
Tom wrote a book about that.
Is it normal?
You know Tom doesn't trust you.
It belongs to me now.
What don't you like about the plan?
There's a spider in the bathroom.
How do we know you're really a doctor?
We're disappointed.
Tom loves to play football.
We'll set up camp here.
Tom told me he didn't like living in Boston.
I agree with what Tom wrote.
Hit Tom.
I lost that bet.
I was surprised to see an old friend of mine there.

Is there a timetable?

Tom is coming to.
Tom is smarter than you are.
I think it's going well.

Don't you like Boston?

Look at it closely.
It won't last long.

Tom is eating the sandwich you made for him.
He said that he takes a walk every morning.
Tom would've liked to help.
The spaghetti is really good at this restaurant.
He has a mild nature.
Do you know what Tom wants?
I just needed to do something for Tom.
I can't remember your name.
Tom learned to dive when he was thirteen.
I didn't think that you and I'd be able to do that by ourselves.
Is everything OK here?
I don't know how he can speak without taking the cigarette out of his mouth.
You were great today.
Sit down with me.
I'm a little under the weather.
You've done something wrong.
Stop overreacting.
You have chosen the best.
Don't let Tom down.
Tom spent the night at a hotel on Park Street.
What if someone sees this?
"With Tom's help, I'm sure I'll be able to do it."
Didn't you know this was going to happen?
He tried to adapt himself to his new surroundings.
Tom wasn't a model student.
Tom isn't ready to go anywhere.
I don't like your band's name. I think that it's stupid.
Describe Tom.
Have you been there?
Tom will be hungry.
Tom and Mary are in the next room.
I wasn't afraid of Tom.
We seldom sing.
I know that Tom can do that.
Do you want us to leave?
I didn't ask Tom to do that.
I went home alone.
Tom talked to me.
The boy threw a stone at the frog.
Where's the remote control for the TV?
Cut the salmon into small pieces.
I hope it rains today.
There was a lot of blood on the floor.
What're you doing here?
I knew Tom would go there.
I noticed that Tom was smiling.
I know that's not why you're here.
I liked Tom.
Tom was a fanatic.
Tom is very skeptical.
Make another choice.
Who's your favorite character in this movie?
It's our fault.
We have to do that before Monday.
The pretty girl in the bikini is Tom's sister.
Have you eaten anything?
"I'd like a kilogram of sugar, too."
That's my stuff.
Don't think I didn't try.
I made the deal.
Why didn't you eat lunch today?
He broke the window on purpose.
I want to have a word with you.
The shop is just in front of the station.
Tom bought a camera and a tripod.
I think Tom is persistent.
Some people don't own computers.
We're all at risk.
Tom doesn't want to hear anything more about Mary.
I think I'm crazy.
Tom asked Mary not to do that anymore.
There's never been a problem before.
I don't think Tom even saw me.
Tom is extremely suspicious.
Children need a lot of sleep.
Can I help you with your luggage?
Kill Tom.
She cannot control her children.
She likes all kinds of sports.
Tom was outraged by Mary's accusations.
Where exactly do you want to go?
Where did you get those jeans?
The flowers smell so good.
They were prohibited from leaving the hotel.
I have no intention whatever of resigning.
I'm alone now.
"Fortunately, they escaped the danger."
Choose the one you like.
Tom won't notice.
I know you're near.
Tom said that Mary wouldn't win.
We will now report on this year's business results.
Do you have it?
How do you know about this?
Tom thanked the manager.
Where do you park?
He complains all the time.
Who wants to kill you?
I think Tom will be able to win tomorrow.
Tom seems to speak French better than before.
You've got an hour.
Fold it.
I don't know why Tom is absent.
This one is better than that one.
Can you remember the first word you learned in French?
Is this my passport?
Some people say that it is human nature to root for the underdog.
Put the car into the garage.
Tom sent Mary a birthday card.
I have to leave.
My cat is sleeping on my bed.
This heating device uses oil as fuel.
Tom has just texted me.
I'd rather take the bus.
Is this your first time to visit Australia?
Tom needs to be informed.
I'm sure he has something up his sleeve.
The cap is too small for me.
We didn't have time to see Tom.
I accidentally spilled coffee on my computer's keyboard.
I knew all I needed to know.
Tom felt the rain on his face.
Tom was listed among the missing.
I think we should talk about it.
Is Tom going to school today?
Tom should've given Mary flowers or something on Valentine's Day.
I hear you're very rich.
What's her name again?
Don't tell Tom I said that.
He ran away from her.
Tom likes teasing Mary.
There were no railroads at that time in Japan.
He married for money.
I don't think you'll like this movie.
I don't know why Tom was fired.
Are you still a bachelor?
Tom was summoned to appear in court.
Are you busy tomorrow night?
We suspect that someone murdered Tom and just made it look like suicide.
I did that in school.
I have a complicated matter I want to discuss with you.
Don't change horses in midstream.
"The more, the better."
Tom definitely needs a shower.
Have you seen my book?
It is said that Japanese people don't celebrate Christmas the way Americans do.
I think Tom is about thirty years old.
Tom told me you'd be here.
I don't like modern jazz.
Which one of you is the oldest?
He noticed straight away.
I drank from the tap.
How did it get here?
Why are you asking me for my opinion?
What are you looking for there?
I thought I told you to stay in the car.
You are big.
My house is about three kilometers from here.
She cut her hand with a knife.
I didn't want to go to bed.
I'm here on vacation.
How many years did it take Tom to do that?
I get along quite well now with my new cane.
Maybe that's not enough.
Put your socks on quickly. We're late.
He knows how to make good use of his time.
Tom doesn't eat fish.
I hear that you did that yesterday.
You don't know Tom as well as I do.
We've got each other.
I can't lend you any money.
"Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you."
I'll pick you up at six.
It's not logical.
Is there anything else to eat?
This is not my area of expertise.
I need to reread this report.
I could hear her sobbing in her bedroom.
Somebody knocked at the door.
The day is almost over.
I'm allergic to some medicine.
"We looked at the sky, but couldn't see any stars."
It's only temporary.
I couldn't find anybody.
Why didn't you tell me Tom couldn't speak French?
She has known better days.
Are you still afraid?
It's almost funny.
You need to decide what kind of person you want to be.
Tom is here to help you.
She's six years older than me.
You can depend on Tom.
Tom is the only one with a key.
Tom took off his bicycle helmet and put it on the table.
Tom didn't ask.
We don't have any water left.
There are many countries and many cultures on Earth.
Tom took his daughter to school.
I used to like coming here.
I don't like Tom very much.
You'll be missed by your friends when you're gone.
Why don't we go out?
I'm sure Tom regrets it now.
Who ate all the pies?
Did you turn off the gas?
Tom's dream is coming true.
I knew Tom was lying.
He is inclined to be lazy.
You have a good heart.
We can't find a good sewing machine anywhere.
Elephants are the largest land animals alive today.
I have no idea what Tom was talking about.
I'll have to do that someday.
The children are cold.
It wasn't true.
How clever!
We're closed today.
Tom showed me his collection of stamps.
I don't think that's possible.
These are daisies.
The police car skidded to a stop.
Do you like trips?
You won't bleed to death.
I feel like I've been here before.
Do you really want to stay?
I left my umbrella in the car.
Tom and Mary both don't like me.
"The phone was ringing, but there was no one to answer it."
Could I get your autograph?
How do you know Tom is safe?
Aren't you going to apologize to Tom?
Who stole the apples?
I hurt my foot.
I wasn't in my office this morning.
Don't approach the dog.
I hope Tom will wait for me.
I don't know what Tom did.
Where are you today?
Tom was three when his mother died.
I know that we still love each other.
That publishing company is in the black.
"By the time you arrive, all arrangements will have been made."
I don't think that we can do that today.
Please take my advice.
She had good reason to file for a divorce.
I want to go out for a walk.
You're very curious.
You are wonderful.
I think I understand what Tom's trying to say.
Tom didn't want to go hunting.
I have relatives in Los Angeles.
Tom was my teacher.
I remember the day I met you.
These apples are beginning to spoil.
You should tell Tom Mary can't swim.
I'll change it.
Tom said that he agreed.
We talked about many things.
Do you think we made the wrong decision?
Tom has light brown hair.
My mother made me a sweater.
Didn't you know Tom wouldn't win?
Tom laughed at my jokes.
Do you like fishing?
That's Tom's house with the red roof.
Is that why you called me?
Do you like to watch movies?
We didn't find anything unusual.
Tom is going to love it here.
Prices continued to rise.
He showed off his new watch.
Tom and I've both worked in Boston.
You're much better looking than I am.
I want the whole world to know about us.
What else can I do to help you?
No one pays attention to anything Tom says anymore.
We study together.
Tom didn't say a single word.
He's smart.
The important thing is to participate.
I suspect Tom is tired.
Can you explain it briefly?
Where were you on Monday?
Can I bring a friend?
I don't mind getting up at six.
I've got to show you something.
Don't go so fast!
How much water is left in the tank?
How would you know?
I hope we can avoid that.
Thank you for your trouble.
I hate myself for hating Tom.
I don't care if you help me or not.
How are they treating you?
I don't think that Tom will agree with you.
Do you think that I should go talk to Tom?
Is it OK if I kiss you?
I don't feel like going to school today.
I refuse to answer such a stupid question.
Did you enjoy yourself?
The monkey climbed up the tree.
Do you enjoy losing?
Leave Tom with me.
It's so bright.
You're standing on my foot.
Tom knew of the risks beforehand.
Tom slipped on the wet floor and dislocated his knee.
That's an excellent idea.
It's already open.
I think you know who I am.
Tom will notify Mary.
The teacher told them not to swim in the river.
I know Tom didn't go to Boston.
Let's always tell each other the truth.
Don't worry. I'll talk to Tom.
It would be best if I met him in person.
We were supposed to tell everyone to leave.
This is a great book.
I faxed Tom a copy of the contract.
I have an apartment in Boston.
The hotel was burned to the ground.
Thanks for the suggestion.
Don't be long.
We could go there now.
Tom arrived at Mary's at 2:30.
This semester I failed two students for plagiarism.
You can't stay here.
Stand up when I'm talking to you!
Tom wasn't invited to the ball.
He is not a teacher but a doctor.
I'll come straight to the point. You're fired.
Tom looked at the map.
That doesn't mean that the danger has passed.
I've already told Tom not to do that anymore.
There are some things you can't learn from books.
I've done all this for you.
Tom told Mary that she shouldn't go out in this kind of weather.
"It took us a long time, but finally we were able to find it."
He wouldn't harm a fly.
I should have told you before.
Drinking on an empty stomach is bad for your health.
She dyed her hair blonde.
I'm glad you decided to come.
I hope no one steals my stuff.
Tom and Mary are rich kids.
I didn't know you were married.
Why didn't you help Tom today?
I don't like my job.
This book is very popular among women.
Tom won't hurt us.
Tom doesn't have what he needs.
I sort of doubt it.
I had finished my homework when you called me.
Everybody liked that.
I'm not talking about you.
Tom told me you could win.
Make a list.
Tom talks a lot.
Marriage is one thing and love is another. Love passes and the husband stays.
I'm learning French.
Let me take you back home.
We need to come up with a new plan.
Tom pronounces my name wrong.
I want to thank you for that.
Introverts often find it difficult to make new friends.
I know that Tom is Canadian.
I'm the only person here who can do that.
Tom used to do it.
Tom didn't know anyone.
He went off without saying good-bye.
I wish there were a more modern translation of this book.
All the cars in this garage belong to Tom.
She went to the movies by herself.
Tom and Mary are looking for you.
We'll take you home.
My husband likes to sleep.
Tell me why you think so.
Did you invite Tom?
I'll never trust Tom again.
Let's talk about the Jacksons.
I could hear sirens in the distance.
Tom said that you wanted to go to Australia with us.
We'd better get started.
I made it on time.
You're deceiving yourself.
He'll become a father soon.
I wanted to do that again.
What made you so angry?
Didn't you know Tom and Mary were John's grandparents?
Maybe eventually you'll decide you don't want to live here anymore.
You seem very nervous this morning.
Why don't you want me to tell anybody?
Is that what you told Tom to say?
This broken vase cannot be repaired.
We had a lot of snow last night.
Drive cautiously.
Didn't you know that I didn't have to do that?
Tom took his son to the petting zoo.
I'll be really careful.
Tom's mother is very strict.
Why didn't you ever tell anyone about it?
Be careful not to drop anything on your feet.
You are old enough to understand this.
I hope that you'll help me.
I've been very busy all week.
Sit over there.
Let me call you back.
It looks like you took care of the problem.
We got it thanks to her.
I can swim as well as you.
Why are you so sure?
The house started shaking.
This book is very new.
Tom told me that he had a problem.
Tom couldn't stop.
No one was supposed to know about that.
I love to paint with watercolors.
Why do you need me here tomorrow?
Maybe I'll fall asleep.
I want you to read this book.
I didn't sleep much last night.
I bought a pineapple at the supermarket.
This custom dates from ancient times.
I've just been to the bank.
I know what I'll do.
Knock on the door before entering the room.
I'd like you to talk to Tom.
Don't let anyone come near the fire.
I only want to help.
Please help us.
Tom is contradicting himself.
They voted against it.
Tom thinks that Mary doesn't know what to do.
I saw his car make a turn to the right.
It's all Tom's fault.
Tom is rumored to be dating Mary.
I didn't have a choice.
I wonder why Tom didn't ask for my help.
You should know it.
Tom is extremely thankful to Mary for her help.
He's good at telling jokes.
Tom is in worse trouble than I thought.
Let's finish it now.
Tom brought three bottles of water.
It is time for her to go home.
I fell asleep.
What does she do?
Did Tom eat anything?
How do you know Tom likes Mary?
Birds often fly together.
I didn't mean to deceive you.
My parents love me.
This fish has a lot of bones.
The scientist is conducting medical research.
I knew Tom would be shocked.
I thought you left with Tom.
You'll feel better in the morning.
I couldn't find out anything.
Did you have a chance to apologize to Tom?
Tom is very upset by what happened.
I'm quite certain that I did the right thing.
One of your buttons has come off.
"If I were you, I wouldn't trust Tom."
Tom asked Mary to babysit John.
I was surprised at the news of his sudden death.
You don't have to convince me.
Thanks for bringing this to us.
That program is still far from perfect.
Tom refused to show me how to do that.
I wish I hadn't spent so much money on the present I bought for Tom.
Did you eat lunch?
I told you to leave it in the car.
I want you to go with me.
Are you laughing at me?
I didn't think that you'd do that.
"Where are the books? ""They're on the desk."""
Where are you going for the summer?
It's your turn to wash the dishes.
Do you realize what you've done?
It's the same for everyone.
Social customs vary from country to country.
Tom didn't want to talk to me.
"At the edge of the forest, I met a tall man in a hunting outfit."
You must make your parents happy.
We're having lunch.
You need to be there for Tom.
I like your country a lot.
I know a couple guys on Tom's team.
What type of tools do you require for the job?
Let me look.
I think Tom would say yes.
These shoes are too expensive.
I'm going to hang out with Tom.
Our website is still under construction.
Tom thought Mary was lying.
I don't normally wear skirts.
Where's the nearest subway station?
They were not listening to music.
How often do you eat fruit?
Tom isn't planning to go to Boston with you.
You're the enemy.
I can't do it.
She worked as an aerobics instructor in her twenties.
What do you learn French for?
Thanks for coming back.
I'm really tired of your complaining.
Many lives were lost in the flood.
Tom isn't watching TV right now.
Tom is busy and can't meet with you right now.
It cost an arm and a leg.
Tom sold the necklace to Mary for a very low price.
Is that even a real word?
He asked me whether I like math.
Distilled water has no taste.
I've already said that I'll do that.
Will you go out with me?
You may use mine if you want to.
The patrolman motioned me to pull over.
I drank from the bottle.
Tom's parents are John and Mary.
Tom is well aware of the problem.
Why didn't you do that?
You seem very nervous this morning.
You can ask Tom.
Has everyone gone crazy?
Why don't you just tell Tom you made a mistake?
I purposely didn't do that.
Tom gave Mary a sweater.
Tom went to the cemetery by himself.
I stopped at the store and got some milk on my way back.
You're a very wise person.
I'll go buy some bread.
Tom waited for Mary to say something.
I can understand Tom.
When did you come in?
I'd never try to do that.
Thanks for helping me out.
It'll soon be Christmas.
It wasn't hers.
They invited me to the party.
I know most people here don't like fishing.
I don't think it's true.
I am a member of the sales department.
It's for me.
Tom and Mary both know that that isn't likely to happen.
I'll need Tom's help.
Who told you to buy that for me?
"In 1860, Lincoln was elected President of the United States."
Tom is in.
I'm proud to be your father.
Did you buy anything to eat?
I tried to find Tom.
I told you it was going to be cold here.
I don't need your money.
Tell Tom I'd like to talk to him.
"That's your favorite, right?"
Tom was given a new uniform.
She hasn't been to the dentist's for years.
I was confused.
I know what I'm saying.
Tom and Mary are sitting on the porch drinking coffee.
Do you have anything against Tom?
Tom isn't sick anymore.
Did you get a good look at his face?
"That's what you wanted, isn't it?"
"They're not the problem, we are."
Tom always does what needs to be done.
I wanted you to know.
She went down the stairs.
I can't afford a new car.
I wrote down his phone number on a scrap of paper.
The bus never came.
How did you learn to dance?
Tom loves Mary with all his heart.
"So far, I haven't told anyone."
A laptop is better than a desktop.
We thought it was funny.
Change the subject.
My father and mother were sitting under a tree.
I thought you'd agree with me.
Neither Tom nor Mary went to school yesterday.
What were you doing last night?
Please accept our heartfelt apologies.
Tom's condition is rapidly worsening.
Tom wasn't drinking tea.
Tom has made a lot of mistakes.
"I got this as a wedding gift, but I've never used it."
Thank you for giving me the option.
I hope this medicine works.
I didn't tell Tom any of that.
Tom's shoes are dirty.
This is the school where my father used to go.
The soup was too hot.
How interesting!
He lost his ticket for the movie.
Who is this girl?
I wanted to thank you for helping me.
That's why I'm telling you not to go alone.
You don't have to read the whole thing from beginning to end.
Tom probably didn't buy anything.
Did Tom actually say that?
I hate my neighbor.
I'm not very good at singing.
I wanted to change.
It's late. You have to go home.
Don't ask me. Ask Tom.
"Did you understand? ""More or less."""
My computer makes a really weird noise.
Why isn't Tom here today?
Nobody wants to go to Australia with you.
Why should I give you money?
Didn't you know Tom had an accident?
Tom hopes he doesn't flunk out of school.
Nobody cares.
Tom and Mary are planning to get divorced.
I'm sick of school.
Send me there.
Tom delivered the package to Mary.
I can't say that to my dad.
Tom bought Mary an expensive ring.
I was a little tired.
I won't be able to do that.
We can't lose.
Tom'll speak.
Tom hesitated a moment before speaking.
"Tom can play the guitar, I think."
What did I do to deserve this?
I can rip you apart with my bare hands.
Tom and Mary haven't unpacked their suitcases yet.
I was really scared.
I know I'm not alone.
Tom slit his wrists.
That's for you.
I spoke with Tom this afternoon.
Don't you want me to go with you?
You're a really good photographer.
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?
Tom pointed at one of the names on the list.
Tom will learn how to do that.
Tom felt powerless.
"A few years ago, there was a huge scandal."
Please remember to mail the letter.
People don't buy milk from this store.
Genius is one per cent inspiration and ninety-nine per cent perspiration.
Tom has been told not to do that here.
We probably don't have enough time to finish doing that today.
I wish Tom luck.
My children were born in Boston.
I have a friend whose father is a famous actor.
How much are they going to pay you?
It isn't always easy.
What grade is Tom in?
Tom would like to see you.
Are you learning French?
I think all of us have to do that.
You know it can't last forever.
Tom told me that he didn't know how to do that.
I hope you can hear me.
"Her hands are small, but not so small that she can't play the piano."
The bridge is about to collapse.
I'll have to do that myself.
It looks like you came prepared.
You're not me.
Did you call the plumber?
He is a man of action.
I still can't believe I did that.
Is it really necessary?
What do you like to do in your free time?
The murderer was executed this morning.
Tom put down his pen.
What do you think of the new teacher?
"Without me, you won't be able to do it."
"You like to talk about architecture, don't you?"
Tom left half an hour ago.
Tom left Mary with no choice.
We'll help you look for Tom.
I hardly ever talk to anyone at work.
He's a world-famous writer.
This is our park.
You don't seem to be as patient as Tom.
I know that you weren't the ones who did that.
You're safe.
The hunter hunted rabbits with his dog.
I'm just kidding.
Let's fix this.
Did you buy a washing machine?
Tom won't stop fighting.
Don't look any further.
I can do it by myself.
We must work hard to promote world peace.
Tom didn't tell Mary he was tired.
Tom works as a blood spatter analyst with the metropolitan police.
Do you want to help me or not?
"When did you buy it? ""Let's see. I bought it last week."""
Time is of the essence.
That American movie was a great success.
Did you buy this for Tom?
Where did you find my umbrella?
I thought we got disconnected.
He comes here almost every day.
I was thirteen when it happened.
Helen Keller was deaf and blind.
Tom has already said yes.
I've already had lunch.
I agreed with his plan.
Tom worked hard yesterday.
Did you do that for Tom?
I don't have to go.
Are you sure you want this?
Tom isn't an expert.
Nobody will hurt you.
Tom wouldn't go to Boston with Mary.
"Even though I looked for it, I did not find it."
Do penguins live at the North Pole?
I'm the only one who laughed.
Give us everything you have.
I don't know where Tom hid the key.
We were together.
Air is lighter than water.
Do you know what's really going on between Tom and Mary?
"Someday, we'll know."
Tom looked back.
Let's not be in too much of a hurry.
I'm going to have a baby.
We took shelter from the rain under a tree.
Tom has something he needs to discuss with Mary.
Come in.
Don't think about it.
Did you know that your door was open?
Can we come?
"Because it was very cold yesterday, I stayed home."
Tom is painting.
I don't want to make you angry.
Tom is a lot smarter now.
Can I borrow your umbrella?
Show me where Boston is on the map.
I met him at Tokyo Station.
She forced him to do it.
I am now in an old castle.
Children can't swim in this river.
You're the one who should be worried.
That's part of the job.
I didn't think you'd have any problems.
Do you think we'll get there on time?
The ice has melted.
I heard what you said.
Tom promised to make Mary a sandwich.
What did they think?
Tom saw blood on the floor.
Is that from Australia?
The dog is barking at you.
The woman is naked.
Is this your house?
Who found them?
You seem very determined.
I was negligent.
I drank out of your glass by mistake.
That's how it works.
Has Tom found his keys yet?
The gestation period of a rhino is about 16 months.
I said that's enough.
I have a brother and a sister. My brother lives in Tokyo and my sister lives in Nagano.
The apartment was furnished in the Victorian style.
I don't think that Tom saw us doing that.
Can you prove Tom didn't do it?
Tom told me he felt cold.
The cost of the painting is very high.
"Tom doesn't care, does he?"
I don't want anyone to know where we are.
I know that he's Tom.
Do you want some wine?
All my friends like you.
Add up these figures.
Did Tom go swimming with you?
Tom knew what he needed to do.
Does anyone have a lighter?
I hope the fog will go away soon.
I want to dance.
Have another cup of coffee.
My pet dog was seriously ill.
That's a nice thought.
Look at this photo.
I have to get this spade fixed.
How many people died?
Call the police.
We have to get up early tomorrow morning.
Where is French spoken?
It's not that easy.
I have almost no money with me.
I don't feel like watching TV.
There is no solution.
Don't you want some ice cream?
That is sold at hardware stores.
Tom is looking ill.
No one expected much.
I'm very tired today.
Can you put some sunscreen on my back?
Tell Tom to take off his shoes.
Tom is used to this kind of situation.
Tom threw a rock at the dog.
It was no coincidence.
Tom got away with the money.
Tom is going bald.
Don't touch my things.
I made no promises.
Tom is always wrong.
We can't ignore Tom's past.
India is the seventh largest country in the world.
I thought it was a good idea at the time.
Thanks for bringing me here.
Tom is driving.
"Help me with my homework, please."
I didn't tell Tom.
"If you're wrong, then I'm wrong, too."
It looks like you're upset.
There's no telling what might happen.
I'd have waited a little bit longer.
She brought up the three children alone.
"Tom doesn't have a dog, either."
That's hardly a secret.

Tom will find you.
Where's the bathroom?
I was bullied.
Guess where I've been.
You don't need to explain.
He promised me he would come early.
I really don't understand anything.
This was in Tom's closet.
"Apart from my sister, my family doesn't watch TV."
No one's watching.
We can't kill Tom.
I see how you did that.
I don't need a lawyer.
I have a slight fever today.
I intended to have finished the work.
This book is written in French.
She made friends with Tom at the party.
I thought Tom could do that.
"Despite everything she said to me, I can't stop thinking about her."
I just moved in.
They were everywhere.
Tom thought that Mary would be a good babysitter.
I know it's a hard thing to do.
We're not leaving.
She put on her sweater.
I've been advised to do that.
Get your filthy hands off of me.
What makes you so sure Tom was the one who stole your bicycle?
I don't try to please everyone.
May I use this telephone?
Did you read it all?
I could go to jail.
I didn't vote for you.
I saw three children in the park.
Are you two traveling together?
Tom pushed Mary toward the door.
"You know what needs to be done, don't you?"
It is not easy to get rid of a bad habit.
It appears to me that you are right.
Tom wanted to be at today's meeting.
It's time for bed.
I want to talk to you after class.
What do you think they'll do?
I didn't know where Tom had been.
I don't think anyone saw us do that.
Tom wiped his tears away.
Who do you think will win the race?
Tom and Mary have decided not to get married.
I have no way to tell.
Tom's suffering.
You don't know how much I love you.
The restaurant where we had dinner yesterday isn't very good.
I lost the watch that my father gave me.
Can I go swimming this afternoon?
Is that all you remember?
You seem quite pleased with yourself.
Tom said he felt the same way.
Have you solved the mystery?
This is where it happened.
I knew I shouldn't have put off doing my homework until the last minute.
Help me out.
Aren't I beautiful?
How did Tom know that that would happen?
Did the interview go well?
Tom and Mary wrote that song together.
Do you go to church on Christmas Day?
She didn't plan on having a fight with him.
Tom thinks Mary can take care of herself.
I'm afraid that I don't share your enthusiasm.
Tom and Mary never got along.
I want to want what you want.
I've loved you from the moment I saw you.
I'll answer all of your questions.
Tom wasn't in when I dropped by.
We can't let Tom go.
Tom is young.
Your French is pretty good.
He's very ill.
He visited a friend.
Are you sure this is such a bright idea?
You said you'd be here by 2:30.
Turn left.
Don't let Tom touch my computer.
Tom announced that he was quitting football.
Tom hasn't done that yet.
I think we should leave.
My parents have kicked me out of the house.
I think I'll call Tom.
Tom woke up around noon.
Tom and I've started dating.
I can't live in this house anymore.
Can people change?
"My father's factory turns out 30,000 cars each month."
She sells flowers.
I'll buy this.
"We should've listened to you, Tom."
What's that in your hand?
Which one is best?
When did all this happen?
These shirts are both the same size.
Tom ignored our advice.
I knew I didn't have enough money.
Do you remember what you told me before?
I found this interesting.
You're the only one who knows how to do this.
Why did Tom want you dead?
We're dieting.
He earned her love.
It seems that Tom is busy.
Do you really want me to tell Tom that you were the one who killed his father?
I just don't agree with you.
Your friendship means a lot to me.
Tom says Mary will never do that.
"Generally speaking, women live longer than men by almost ten years."
No one had a flashlight.
Tom had to take a detour.
Could you please clear the table?
The train should be on time.
I found this book interesting.
I didn't know you'd be early.
Don't put anything in the bag.
We will fight.
How many people live in Australia?
Tom will go fishing by himself.
We'll be back.
Tom made the wrong decision.
I didn't tell you because I thought you weren't interested.
Take this medicine.
We are sorry we can't help you.
Tom said that he sold his car to Mary.
We have been friends.
Give me those gloves.
Tom did what he should do.
See what's going on.
Tom asked me to give you something.
Where were you at 2:30 on Monday afternoon?
Tom got away with the money.
I'm sure Tom meant what he said.
I didn't know you were a vegetarian.
Do you often borrow Tom's car?
We're all at risk.
Can you tell me where you were at the time of the murder?
What did you do with my glasses? They were here a minute ago.
Tom came home at 2:30.
Did you swim?
Where should I put this box?
Tom's choking.
I wasn't surprised by their responses.
Tom can't read any menu not written in English.
Tom barely touched his breakfast.
Why are we moving to Boston?
"Tom was having trouble breathing, so we took him to the hospital."
I've lost my pen.
Tell Tom why.
She cannot stop him.
I have caught a cold.
Tom has been ignoring Mary.
Tell me anything you want to.
Could you turn down the volume?
I'll wait up for Tom.
"Let's not talk shop, OK?"
Tom looked up quickly.
What makes you think Tom won't come?
"Kiss me, Tom."
The view from the mountain top was spectacular.
Tom crossed the bridge.
Are you satisfied with the results?
They're not expensive.
Tell me how it happened.
I came to wish you good luck.
The taxi has arrived.
I'm surprised Tom didn't win.
Tom didn't help me.
"The police caught Tom red-handed, breaking into a house in our neighborhood."
No one was arrested.
Years passed.
What do you want this for?
I don't know what he'll do.
Yours was better than mine.
You should apologize to Tom for what you said.
You don't know Tom like I do.
It took Tom a lot of time to find a parking space.
There are three Toms in my class.
This pamphlet is free of charge.
The moon was full last night.
Show us the room.
Can I have one?
Please tell me how to get to the beach.
Where's your weapon?
I've missed out on so much.
Why should I hire you?
I wish I could see her.
I want someone to talk to.
We're not going to wait for Tom.
Tom thought something had happened to Mary.
Raise your hand if you know the answer.
What's the problem this time?
A lightyear is the distance that light travels in one year.
Why is love so difficult?
There is no message.
Very few passengers survived the accident.
I got your text.
I went to the park yesterday.
Don't keep people waiting.
Tom finally stopped.
Airplanes are expensive.
That's the only reason I'm actually going.
I didn't bring my bathing suit.
I'm not angry with you.
Did you try the chicken?
The leaves of the trees have turned red.
Take the wheel.
You're a good student.
I think that Tom is from Australia.
Tom never cared about money.
"It's Tom who can't speak French, not me."
I shouldn't have kissed you.
Tom hasn't run for office for years.
Results will be announced Monday.
Did you plant pumpkins this year?
I am yours and you are mine.
"Once you have made a promise, you must keep it."
"You're an engineer, aren't you?"
It was all a dream.
Please don't run away from me.
Why are you so unhappy?
You've got to avoid that.
I'm not even tired.
I'd like to thank you for coming today.
Tell me how Tom and Mary met.
Tom convinced Mary not to do that.
"When he heard the news, he turned pale."
Tom parked the car behind Mary's house.
Tom can't be at today's meeting.
We've got to get you to a hospital.
Tom is alone again.
You didn't say how much it cost.
Tom loves you very much.
It happens to all of us.
They both can speak French.
I'm not sure I trust you.
I know all my neighbors.
I often wrote to her when I was a student.
Would you please help us?
"Your table is ready, sir."
Your explanation is too abstract to me.
I started learning English six years ago.
The two of them split up.
Tom tried the shoes on.
Tom is too drunk to drive. Could you take him home?
We had no water to drink.
I made it for you. Do you like it?
She deliberated over whether to go or stay.
"By the way, I have something to tell you."
I already answered that question.
I've always distrusted Tom.
My name also happens to be Tom.
I didn't ever expect to see Tom again.
Tom will be busy at this time tomorrow.
You're insane.
No one else came to the meeting.
She furnished the room with beautiful furniture.
Would you calm down?
You are in serious trouble.
You are the best.
You changed it?
You know the law.
No one seems to know you.
You must forgive me.
Tom told me to behave myself.
Tom was in a very good mood.
It was very unpleasant.
I know it was all a mistake.
He looks a bit tired.
They gave me a ten percent discount.
How do you heat the house?
We're going to win.
Could you speak a little louder?
I do that because I want to.
I sent you a photo.
"You don't know German, do you?"
We had to go there together.
Why don't you want to help the police?
I'm looking for a lipstick to go with this nail polish.
Do you think it'll be cold tomorrow?
Tom didn't ask when the meeting would begin.
The blanket is still wet.
I met a friend of Mary's.
The table was loaded with fruit.
That bar is one of his favorite haunts.
I spent almost a week in Boston.
He is glad about his son's love of books.
You're going to miss me.
I'm really glad you're here.
Where did you work?
How long has this been going on?
Does that really surprise you?
No one told us anything.
I'm only the substitute teacher.
Can you repair it?
I was very surprised.
He bought the land for the purpose of building his house on it.
We're barely getting by.
Where have you been all this time?
Tom comes from a culture where women artificially color their lips and put holes in their earlobes.
If I'd only read the contract more carefully!
I didn't say I wasn't going.
Do you play tennis well?
Tom missed you.
We don't live here.
You know why I left.
Tom didn't want to study French.
I have bad news.
I told Tom that he should go to the meeting.
No one can resist.
Do you know what I'm doing?
I'm teaching French to Tom.
I hate doing things like this.
"If you want me to go, I'll go."
This was a lie.
Wake up!
Do you really think Tom is better than me?
It's not over yet.
I have a yoga class tomorrow.
Why did you become a police officer?
Tom is stronger than me.
You're not going to die.
We hung up the laundry together.
Tom has some things that he needs to buy.
You can't use this washing machine.
The autopsy confirmed that Tom died from a gunshot wound.
I'll come back. I promise.
I haven't seen Tom in ages.
Tom needs to get some help.
I am going to play soccer after school.
Please tell me your real name.
I'm sure we'll find something to do.
That's all I ask.
We have to do something to help Tom.
Thanks for the tip.
Tom didn't leave a message.
You should never look down on a person merely because he is poor.
I don't know when Tom will come home.
Do you know much about Tom?
"Tom won't help, will he?"
Tom ate all the cookies.
Shut up!
Let's talk about that right now.
What prevented you from doing that?
Can you tell me why Tom came back to Boston?
Tom won't be able to be there.
I pointed my finger at Tom.
He needs discipline.
I'm sure I can't do that.
It's outside your jurisdiction.
I need to get out of Boston.
We just hired Tom.
Tom asked if any of us could speak French.
I don't know Tom's last name.
Tom has enough money to buy everything he really needs.
What did you find?
Tom didn't even bother replying.
Tom said he's very happy.
I often wear jeans and a T-shirt.
Cats are related to tigers.
I got lost coming here.
Why's Tom speaking French?
Now we don't know what to do.
This coat does not fit me any more.
Owls hunt at night.
We went in search of gold.
I do not know how to use it.
I've been an idiot.
Tom tiptoed out of the room.
What have you come here for?
Here is what I want you to do.
I don't care what you did.
Mary hit Tom with her purse.
Did you know there was a secret passage hidden behind the bookcase?
Now it's all clear to me.
I told you to leave Tom alone.
My shirt isn't dry yet.
I didn't know how I could help.
I left Australia three weeks ago.
I wonder who named this ship.
Tell me about it tomorrow.
I'm not sure where I am.
I can talk Tom out of doing that.
"At last, the truth became known to us."
"You were right, Tom."
Don't rush me.
I need to see you in person.
Who's the author of this story?
It is difficult to prove that ghosts exist.
Tom was correct about one thing.
Pour the tea into the cup.
It's 8:00 p.m.
It's a shame that you're not coming.
Do you think that Tom has enough money to buy that?
This is my baby.
My grandparents died before I was born.
I'll do this myself.
"I paid 1,500 yen for this dictionary."
I don't have a lot of patients.
My watch is very accurate.
I'll drive.
I never claimed I was perfect.
How small is it?
I don't think that I heard you correctly.
What are you going to do today?
Tom told me just the opposite.
Tom didn't win the prize.
Better late than never.
The neighbor's dog barked all night.
Tom postponed his departure till Sunday.
Don't scare the girls.
Thank you for your patience.
I thought I could count on you.
Tom warned me that this might happen.
Your zipper is open.
I was drugged.
What songs are you going to sing tonight?
Tom is trying to help.
It looks like you've put on some weight.
Can you repair this?
I've already told you everything.
Why are you so impatient?
Bad weather kept us from going out.
I think Tom is Mary's older brother.
This kind of thing usually takes a long time.
Let's put this behind us and move on.
The boys played cops and robbers.
You're undependable.
What are the pros and cons of hitchhiking?
Have you ever gotten a speeding ticket?
I like that one.
I should've listened to Tom more closely.
Tom can't stay there.
Maybe the doctor can give Tom something for the pain.
What did they reply?
Playing in the street is dangerous.
The problem is that that boy never does what he is told to do.
Tom found it.
I can't remember exactly how old I was when I first met you.
There was no water in the well.
He's cruel.
I haven't talked to Tom.
Do you think I want this?
A pack of wolves attacked the traveler.
There is no air on the moon.
Another blanket would be nice.
I enjoyed reading about your dreams.
Do you really want to have kids?
The sun is much larger than the moon.
Let's give it to Tom.
It's a dead-end relationship.
I was off duty at the time.
I've never been in love.
That's just useless.
I didn't know you were there.
I think you should go by taxi.
"Mom, can Tom stay for dinner?"
Tom doesn't think Mary will ever come back to Boston.
He always tries to have his own way.
Tom is a microbiologist.
Tom took copious notes.
Tom is hopelessly in love.
That's a very beautiful picture.
Tom has high moral standards.
Aren't you ready yet?
I knew Tom was good.
Tom was quite concerned about what was happening.
Could you be careful with that?
The balloon descended slowly.
May I borrow your bicycle?
This idea is controversial.
Tom ran out of water.
You look fine.
I'm lucky.
May I see your license?
Hand me a towel.
They never spoke to us.
Tom did what they told him to do.
Who told you Tom was living on Park Street?
It was dark blue.
I'd stop doing that if you asked me to.
Fold it.
"While in Europe, she visited Rome."
Could I ask you something?
Tom said he would do it himself.
I spent the whole day thinking about Tom.
I'm writing a new book.
I have an overbite.
I have an appointment with Tom.
Don't you know what to do?
This stone was so heavy that I could not lift it.
Do you think anybody would pay more than thirty dollars for this?
Don't talk to me about Tom.
Isn't there an easier way to do that?
Do you have to go now?
I don't think that Tom knows what I want.
"When she was young, she was very beautiful."
Show me what you bought.
Do you hate Tom that much?
I don't do this for the money.
I didn't hear Tom come in.
This time is different.
How did you hurt your back?
I've never seen so many birds at one time before.
Did you really expect me to believe that?
It isn't you I hate.
I should have brought a lunch.
The feeling is mutual.
Don't tell Tom where I live.
I left my bag here.
No wonder it took you so long.
I'm surprised you called.
I've got to be free.
Tom thinks that the sun revolves around the earth.
Tom is doing what he can.
When did Tom sing?
"Tom told us you were Canadian, too."
You've succeeded where others have failed.
Keep your thoughts to yourself.
Tom is blessed with a cheerful disposition.
Tom washes clothes at least once a week.
Three soldiers were wounded.
I am happy that you are my friend.
Tom was joking.
Stay with Tom in this room.
Tom told only me.
Why don't you get something to drink?
They plan to get married tomorrow.
"If you don't eat, you'll die."
Don't pretend what you don't feel.
Are you leaving now?
Tom broke his glasses.
I had some help painting the fence.
I thought I had everything.
I thought you didn't want me to do that.
I've kept a diary for three years.
Tom and I'll sing together.
Do you have anything to declare?
I already said that.
I want you to tell me how to do this.
I'm correct.
I told Tom to leave early in the morning.
Have you taken your medicine?
You can't run away.
Please make coffee.
They are on good terms with their neighbors.
What's Tom carrying?
She was always quarreling with her brothers.
Don't play in the road.
The national flag of the USA is called the Stars and Stripes.
Tom waved his hand and smiled.
Tom barricaded himself in his bedroom.
Tom said he was upset.
What I need to do now is get some sleep.
I must get going.
I hope you'll get better soon.
Tom's neighbors called 911.
No one is going to help us.
I haven't slept a wink.
Clean up the room.
Tom did that very carefully.
I think we should buy a new car.
I have a pencil.
I miss you a lot.
Tom is looking for his keys.
Is the bath clean?
She is busy right now and she can't speak with you.
He always yells at me when he is angry.
Let me swim.
What do you like about her?
Tom took my money.
Tom is fluent in French and English.
Tom taught Mary how to fly a kite.
You have a good plan.
We don't use our coal cellar anymore.
I can't find what I'm looking for.
They decided to build a bridge.
My watch is accurate.
"She said she was twenty years old, which was not true."
Tom said he'd let me know if anything happened.
You're introverted.
I need new boots.
Tom is a virtuoso.
"Even when I sat in the sun, I was cold."
I have things to do.
How can this be true?
The capital of Ukraine is Kiev.
I'll have a glass of red wine.
This problem isn't going to go away.
I was absent from work yesterday.
I don't think Tom even knows my name.
I need some sleep.
You may quote me.
I'm sorry that you couldn't come with us.
Tom just told me about your new car.
I read a lot.
That's an original idea.
I like each of them.
She is going to learn how to drive.
Why did Tom go to the supermarket?
What didn't you understand?
I don't like tennis.
I won't forget you.
We'd better wait until tomorrow.
The old man asked me the time.
The bar is closing soon.
I'm the one who painted this picture.
Did you write down Tom's phone number?
Does Tom have the same opinion?
"Tom, get ready for school."
"Find mutual interests, and you will get along with each other."
Tom looks discouraged.
I don't like being contradicted.
Trust Tom.
Tom tried to stand up.
Tom is fishing.
She worked so hard that eventually she became ill.
I sleep better at home than I do in hotels.
Can you call me a taxi?
My work is almost finished.
I like puzzles.
Have you ever heard Tom singing?
I wonder who Tom is waiting for.
I don't want you to think about it anymore.
Are you here to help?
I'm sorry I was late.
I am a 22 year-old man.
Tom isn't healthy.
Tom weighs about 60 kilos.
"As a matter of fact, bankruptcy is inevitable."
I have to hurry. My flight leaves in an hour.
I waited for you and Tom.
You'll find a way.
What kind of pills are those?
May I take a nap on your couch?
Keep looking around.
Tom broke the silence.
Tom wets his bed.
There's something going on there.
Who's free?
Please tell me what that means.
Let's not talk about it.
Take a good look.
What was your response?
She answered with a nod.
Tom told me he was having trouble sleeping.
You never told me that you were married.
That was somebody else's idea.
I think it's much better now.
I am human.
The cat is dead.
Tom is pale.
Don't believe any of it.
Tom told everybody at school about what had happened.
I didn't want you to go away.
Tom isn't used to speaking in public.
Tom found a wallet on the sidewalk.
We're going in the right direction.
His house was struck by lightning.
I'll take you with me.
Tom is a good swimmer.
I don't think Tom knows how bad it is.
Tom had a puzzled look on his face.
I'll be home by 2:30.
Tom nodded affirmatively.
What's your favorite time of day?
I wonder why Tom is so fat.
Tom got fatter.
Don't forget to talk to Tom tomorrow.
Call your sisters.
Give me some milk.
You may go home now.
I agree that we shouldn't do that.
Tom told me about that.
Tom and Mary encouraged each other.
"You knew, didn't you?"
Did you do that intentionally?
I've got my pride.
I should go home.
Tom was living in Boston last year.
You're kidding!
Tom said he wanted to buy a sleeping bag.
She doesn't have any enemies.
"Without your help, I would have failed."
My health is good.
"Could I have the bill, please?"
The children were all drawing pictures of animals.
I want you to know I'll do that for you.
He always wears a blue shirt.
I admit that I'm tired.
We have a test today.
Get out of the kitchen.
What language do they speak in your country?
He began to raise beef cattle.
What'll you tell Tom?
Tom wants to call his lawyer.
The school is within walking distance of my house.
Tom is no longer afraid of the dark.
"If that happens, let me know."
Tom's jokes aren't always funny.
It is clear that he is guilty.
I want to hear your voice.
I need to buy some flea medicine for my dog.
The professor was unable to comprehend what I meant.
We talked on the phone until midnight.
Where will everybody sleep?
I went skating on the lake.
I think you might need some help.
I can't go alone.
It depends on the weather.
I know Tom is a specialist.
I don't want to run into Tom.
This is unusual.
You were the last person to see Tom.
Do you know what your name means?
He boasts that he can swim well.
Please show me this book.
When did you buy this bread?
That's how I got to know her.
I'll take the yellow one.
Try to control yourself.
I don't have a job right now.
Anyone can do it if they try.
I don't think this is for you.
Can you tell me what you're doing here?
Can you spare a cigarette?
I don't think that'll be a problem.
I ran away from home.
We must keep this in mind.
It's always been that way.
What's the one thing you would have done differently?
Hold the door.
Tom hasn't come back yet.
Tom asked me if I'd bought any eggs.
I was surprised at his strong resemblance to his father.
We both agree.
Why are they angry?
She will pay for everything.
Who broke it?
It's awfully expensive.
You have to promise not to tell anyone.
This doctor is a man of culture.
I need to charge my cell phone.
There's nothing else I can do for you.
I'm not advocating that.
Iron is used in building ships.
Tom was quite motivated.
Tom went to the store to buy some apples.
Nobody's ever said anything like that to me before.
Please tell me where you bought that.
A man was fishing on the opposite bank.
Tom showed Mary the letter he got from John.
What time do you eat supper?
Now I'll finally be able to get some sleep.
I don't love Tom anymore.
Tom knows that Mary doesn't know how to drive.
I started the car.
She left for America the day before yesterday.
Winter has gone. Spring has come.
Tom got mad at me for not listening to him.
You're welcome to any book in my library.
She is not as young as she looks.
Tom told me he was going to commit suicide.
I'm always busy.
It's a lot easier to fall in love than to stay in love.
Be friendly.
Come on down.
That dress fit her perfectly.
I wish that we could spend more time together.
I haven't seen Tom in weeks.
The store is closed Mondays.
Tom was eating.
She planted roses in the garden.
Tom has a patch of gray in his hair.
What do you care?
Tom might be the traitor.
No one is too old to learn French.
I wonder if Tom would win.
Tom should've bought more food.
What did you feel?
Tom leaned over to tie his shoelaces.
Tom doesn't seem to get along well with anyone.
Do you want to join them?
He usually went to bed at eleven.
Learning French takes time.
Tom refused to shake Mary's hand.
I can't be late.
I live nearby.
Tom doesn't want to go to the movies.
We thought you didn't like it.
Did you buy it?
It's in your truck.
I want you to come.
Don't be so childish.
Stop doing that.
Put them on the table.
He won the election by a large majority.
That's exactly what I'm going to do.
Tom was murdered by Mary.
What's your favorite city in the world?
"I'm sorry, I don't have time to help you today."
Tom doesn't know what happened to Mary.
Tom will be killed.
Did you plant this yourself?
We need to speak with you.
You always tell me that.
Tom is going to call you soon.
Where is your school?
I remember that I closed the door.
Mary is prettier than her sister.

Can I see this one?
We're going to have to work together.
What are your assumptions based on?
I don't think it's necessary to do that.
Tom won't know I'm here.
There's a difference between silly and stupid.
You said you were busy.
Did you go anywhere during the summer vacation?
You should've told Tom that a long time ago.
What you said is correct.
Tom refused to talk about it.
Do you remember what I told you the last time we met?
Tom had to go back to Boston.
Is this your apple?
I bought this printer yesterday.
Is this where Tom sits?
You did not answer my question.
Tom promised.
I keep in touch with Tom.
I'd like to meet Tom.
Children go back to school in autumn.
What don't you like about the plan?
Where would you like to go next summer?
Are you satisfied with the result?
The kids were excited about the arrival of the circus.
I wasn't worried.
Tom is a hockey fan.
They'll kill me.
Who's your doctor?
You need to go there immediately.
In ancient times people believed that the earth was flat.
Don't tell me what I already know.
Don't sign the contract in pencil.
I wish I hadn't believed you.
My ex-husband no longer lives in this city.
Do you really know?
When was the last time you had a vacation?
We were told not to do that anymore.
Our relations with our director are excellent.
Tom will never let Mary win again.
I will not eat ice cream.
Please tell me you're not leaving.
I'm sorry that I couldn't go with you.
It was beginner's luck.
Is there a cat under the table?
We were just looking for Tom.
I need your car.
You seem very nervous.
She turned pale when she heard that news.
Tom asked if he could walk me home.
I told you to leave me alone.
Are you a dog person or a cat person?
Tom told me that he didn't want to move to Boston.
They named their dog Cookie.
You shouldn't rely on other people's help.
Turn the radio down.
We spent the day in the open air.
He decided to become a pilot.
He is not a man to be trifled with.
Do you really wanna talk about this now?
How will you get Tom to help us?
Could you be careful with that?
Let's get off here.
How high is it?
Don't worry. I'll be right back.
We both understand each other.
I thought everyone already knew this.
You take this one.
This is great.
Tom knows a few magic tricks.
There's nothing to complain about.
Why is this happening to us?
Show it to Tom and me.
May I use your eraser? I seem to have lost mine.
Tom and I are old friends.
Do you know where I live?
I want to show you something first.
Turn down the volume.
There's a lot I want to talk to you about.
"A woman wrote 30 books about how to become happy, and then committed suicide."
I understand everything now.
Find out what happened.
I put those photos on my webpage.
I don't know why I thought it would be different this time.
All you do is criticize others.
Tom climbed up so high that we couldn't see him.
Tom's hair is turning gray.
Tom scolded me.
Anybody here?
They said the deal was off.
Don't you see me?
What would you like to eat for dinner?
I will give you a large folder.
He's asking you to help him.
What is the theme of his latest novel?
Tom is secretive.
Who is out there?
We need more people like you.
I'll be back at 2:30.
I winked.
Her car is two years old.
Could I borrow your shovel?
Tom wasn't in love with me. He was in love with Mary.
What are you getting ready for?
Tom hasn't yet read the report you wrote.
What do you have in that box?
Tom lived a good long life.
Tom never went to Boston.
You're my age.
He provided food and clothes for his family.
Tom spilled the milk.
God bless you!
Tom didn't want me to go to Boston with Mary.
You really deserve it.
I know you have to go back to Boston.
I can't stop anything.
Tom accused Mary of lying through her teeth.
"Unfortunately, my father isn't at home."
Did you shave yesterday?
I'll tell everyone what you did.
Are you sure this is what you want?
Are those your students?
I should try to help Tom.
Didn't you know it was possible to get there by train?
Tom thought he was a cat.
Bring it back.
I told Tom that he should apologize to Mary.
He has very bad luck.
Tom's the smallest of the three.
I trust her.
The situation hasn't improved.
Nobody knows where he lives.
It was the perfect day for a picnic.
Do you know how to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit?
She lived there about five years.
How do you know that's where Tom is now?
Napoleon was exiled to St. Helena.
Drinking on an empty stomach is bad for your health.
Tom will explain it to you.
I never really thought about it.
Tom wants to know when Mary will go shopping.
I don't think that Tom knows all the rules.
I'm trying my best to forget that ever happened.
I have an uncle who lives in Australia.
Old people often talk to themselves.
I didn't know Tom was your grandson.
I got a gift from one of my colleagues.
Don't you have anything to eat?
I'm not certain Tom knows what to do.
Tom thought that Mary wouldn't like John.
He is a shade better today.
I have a bone to pick with you.
Water clarity is excellent.
You're gorgeous.
Tom is 3 years older than Mary.
Tom promised it would never happen again.
What are you doing here so late at night?
Let's throw it away.
I've known this for a long time.
I'm going to need a wig.
No one knows what's right.
I know what you're feeling.
That will take hours.
Did you report that to the police?
You know that that's not true.
I want to read the book.
Tom didn't know that I was from Australia.
Tom plans to sit in the back.
"A cup of tea, please."
I'm sure I've seen that guy somewhere before.
That's all wrong.
How high is that building?
He put me up for a night.
Why don't we eat at a restaurant tonight?
You said that you needed more time.
Tom seems to be jealous.
Will you return this pen to me when you are through?
Let me hold your hand.
Tom warned you that this might happen.
Do you want to eat?
I had to go to work.
Tom knew what to say.
Tom's dog isn't as big as mine.
"If it had not been for your help, I would have failed."
Mary screamed and fainted.
Don't light the candle.
I will always be with you.
Bring your wallet.
I just didn't care.
Tom read the entire book in three hours.
We met in college.
She will get married to a rich man.
Tom ignored our advice.
You must go back.
It's getting bigger.
I'd have preferred you do that.
I'll go to the hospital.
You must do that.
"I like his new house, but I had not expected it to be so small."
I hate living alone.
They regarded the man as a danger to society.
I don't understand this word.
The policeman is on duty.
"You're not very busy, are you?"
That's Tom's home.
What Tom told you was a lie.
Tom wanted to leave Mary.
I'm not going into details.
You can just call me Tom.
A sleeping child is like an angel.
My friend copied my homework and the teacher found out.
"I understand, but I cannot agree."
Can you manage alone?
Did you see the rainbow?
Do you think there's a connection?
Let's ask them.
I'm never getting married.
Mum's the word.
I live in Boston and Tom lives in Chicago.
Tom wants you to have it.
I don't know if I can help.
This one is ours.
Are you getting a divorce?
Traveling is a luxury I can't afford.
I sat on something and broke it.
Why are you locking the door?
Tom has been asked not to do that already.
Neither Tom nor Mary has done that yet.
Tom was unarmed.
Have you ever been on TV?
Everybody thought that Tom was Canadian.
"No pain, no gain."
Tom stood near Mary.
The sky has become overcast.
I was going to go.
May I take a shower?
"In 1994, there was a shortage of water and rice in Japan."
I should clean the room.
"You're not rich, are you?"
Does this have gelatine in it?
You may not get this chance again.
Tom lived here before he moved to Boston.
The group is running on the beach.
I don't have a car.
President Lincoln was what we call a self-made man.
He outsmarted me.
I think you know we need to do that.
Is her father alive?
I wrapped myself in a towel.
He looks just like his mother.
Tom folded up his umbrella.
"That's good, isn't it?"
You've told me that already.
I can't do that without Tom.
Translating is very tiring.
Tom said he had something important to do.
She's forgotten how to do it.
Tom said Mary has passed away.
My hearing isn't as good as it used to be.
Where will you be tomorrow evening?
Tom talked in his sleep.
Go play with Tom.
I haven't heard you play the guitar in a long time.
You can draw your own conclusions.
A hundred years have passed since the Titanic sank.
There isn't a scrap of food in the refrigerator.
I heard you talking.
I was just saying how happy you two must be.
Can I talk to you privately?
I'll find a doctor.
I caught him cheating on the test.
Did you really give Tom that car?
I heard that Tom won the spelling bee.
There is a bench under the tree.
This isn't for sale.
How much did you get paid?
You should ask Tom those questions.
He's shorter than Tom.
My schedule is tight for the next three days.
Her eyes were filled with tears when she pictured the sad scene to herself.
That certainly requires courage.
Wait. Don't go.
I am wiping the shelves.
Tom asked for some water.
"Mom, Tom's hitting me!"
I'm never going to talk to Tom again.
I need you to see this.
Adaptation is the key to survival.
They refused to join the army.
This is my doll.
Tom doesn't have time for that.
You must help her.
I knew they were your friends.
Today is a very hot day.
I fell asleep while reading.
We'll know soon.
"We drove through village after village, until we got to our destination."
I burned all my old books.
We're all having lunch.
I need a translation.
How can I prove my innocence?
You know where I'll be.
This one is better than that one.
Is it just eight-thirty?
Tom will tell me everything.
This is a dress that Mary made by herself.
I helped Tom set the table.
Are you going to help Tom?
Tom looked scared.
One man was seen digging with his bare hands.
You're in danger.
My grandfather passed away three years ago.
What exactly happened here?
Why do you want to do that?
"You're married, aren't you?"
I blinked.
I enjoyed the concert except that the hall was cold.
I don't feel cheated.
I have won.
Tom is getting better.
I have exactly the same dictionary.
I don't think that Tom could see what was going on.
My wife was there.
That's my CD.
Do you blame me?
Look at what's happening outside.
What a strange story!
I'm afraid that we can't go on Monday.
Photography is an expensive hobby.
"Tom got blamed, but it wasn't his fault."
I agreed to meet Tom next Monday.
Are you comfortable?
I can't share that information with you.
Why did you do this to me?
"This book costs 3,000 yen."
You have to speak only English.
They all thought that Tom was crazy.
Don't tell my wife that.
I don't like carrots at all.
We're all working hard.
How could we not have noticed?
I think it's time to leave.
I don't think that Tom has any money left.
I thought you were a teacher.
What's wrong with me?
A true scientist wouldn't think like that.
Tom offered no apologies.
He is not studying English now.
I'll do my best to have the report ready by 2:30.
I'm pretty sure that Tom won't do that.
He speaks four languages.
Have you paid the electric bill?
You and I both know that's not going to happen.
Tom doesn't have the courage to do that.
"When ice melts, it becomes liquid."
Tom will leave tomorrow morning.
"I know Tom's hiding something, but I don't know what."
Will you excuse us for a moment?
You have the right to remain silent.
Tom shaved off his mustache.
They both want to say something.
Are you winning?
I think that Tom will be able to do that sooner or later.
I want to kiss you.
They told us to wait.
Tom believes in the supernatural.
Can you buy some sugar on your way home?
I've been thinking about going to Australia again.
Please say it in French.
The bride came into the room with lowered eyes and with everyone staring at her.
I'm not suicidal.
Tom is absent because he's sick.
Have I done something wrong?
I want Tom to stay.
Tom and Mary have a small farm.
Tom agreed.
She picked me an apple.
I left my umbrella behind in the taxi.
Do you like playing computer games?
You were the only person who talked to Tom.
Many students have failed the test.
I still haven't found my keys.
This desk cost me $300.
Tom lived there by himself.
They put Tom in jail.
Do you know who invented the telegraph?
No one cared.
I leave this afternoon.
Nobody knows your secret.
I'm just going to assume Tom will be here.
I agreed to do that.
I won't bother you.
Let me try it.
Tom is sleeping in his room.
My children are sick.
I don't like drinking.
Tom smells weird.
He has run out of energy.
You promised that you wouldn't drink today.
There isn't any need for you to rush.
I don't think that Tom is crying.
"Since he was tired, he went to bed."
I guess I deserved that.
You should know that.
We both want it.
Where have you been all week?
Tom was paid three hundred dollars for doing that.
Tom was looking for you.
Tom sat down on the floor next to Mary.
I was already tired.
Tom said he was hungry.
We aren't very hungry yet.
Tom handed Mary the briefcase.
No one is there but Tom.
I'd like to talk to you.
My work is not complete yet.
He comes round once a week.
It was a bomb.
I'll ask around and let you know what I find out.
Have you told Tom why you want to study French?
We don't even know what Tom wants.
"He seldom, if ever, comes."
It's too long.
Didn't I just tell you not to do that?
Tom never wears jeans.
I don't have any clean socks.
Tom will catch you.
I've been here since 2:30.
I'm the owner of this house.
I knew I'd seen it before.
"Tom loves Mary, but Mary loves John."
Let's do this properly.
My room is a mess.
Tom was at the end of the line.
He explained it in detail.
Tom wants us to come back.
You said that an hour ago.
Both Tom and I didn't do that.
I'd say the same thing.
Sit back and enjoy it.
I am old.
Tom said no.
I finally gave up.
Tom has become a Canadian citizen.
What time was it when you entered the building?
I barely know you.
I'm listening to the music.
I was the one who taught Tom how to read.
I'm not thinking about it.
I don't see the point.
I just don't like you.
Tom couldn't reach the top shelf.
I want to know where Tom went.
Tom just wanted to be happy.
I suspect that Tom won't want to do that tomorrow.
I'm going to take swimming lessons.
I am short.
We assemble water heaters.
I thought it was a bottle.
Don't count on Tom to help you.
Do you have a cell phone?
Please help Tom.
"I could make you do that, but I won't."
You must tell me everything.
I teach French at this school.
Don't worry. I'll do it.
I don't think Tom will do anything.
I kept it a secret.
You're so naive.
We need to know more about you.
We need to do this quickly.
He was too tired to go any farther.
This work is simple enough that even a child can do it.
Could you come over right now?
Something bad was about to happen.
You're better than they are.
I never thought that that would happen to me.
I can't believe that Tom kissed me.
The frog came out of the water.
"If you want, you can go."
I've seen that face somewhere before.
Where is Tom now?
Will it ever stop raining?
We have to catch Tom.
Follow your dreams.
That's what we think.
It's not an impossible request.
Think about it tonight.
It was raining heavily when I got up this morning.
"If it were not for water, we couldn't live."
Tom must've been worried.
Tom and Mary have done that many times.
I saw Tom outside.
Mary ironed Tom's shirts.
"Somehow, you look different today."
She allowed him to go alone.
I forgot to give you back your umbrella.
Tom used to have a black car.
I got my eyes tested.
This wine's very intoxicating.
Were you scolded by your teacher?
I was horrified.
Tom originally comes from Australia.
Did you recognize any of those people?
This is my old bike.
Tom is too young to drive.
How much will it cost to get to the airport?
Pull your pants up.
She's concerned about your safety.
I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about.
Belgium is not as large as France.
I'll ask Tom that question the next time I see him.
Tom is going to tell Mary tomorrow.
I bought it at a reduced price.
I won't be able to do it by myself.
I knew I'd forgotten something.
"Sorry to trouble you, but can you help me?"
I learned to drive when I was fifteen.
I want you to stay with Tom.
I don't mind walking in the rain.
Tom drank some water.
What did Tom eat for lunch?
I'm sure Tom won't agree to do that.
I wanted to become rich.
"Please speak a little slower, Tom."
I don't think I have the willpower to quit smoking.
I bought Mary a scarf.
Do you want me to ask Tom to do that for you?
I think Tom will win.
I read your book.
He's walking around in his underwear.
I was invited by Tom.
Tom called Mary to tell her he loved her.
Women are often judged by their looks.
Are you through with the phone?
I don't have anything to hide.
I think you're overly optimistic.
What do you think I should've said?
This is a common occurrence.
Tom couldn't believe somebody wanted to kill him.
Have I lost my edge?
Haven't you called the police yet?
Thoughts are expressed by means of words.
I don't agree with you on this point.
This milk smells bad.
I think it wouldn't be too hard to come up with a better system.
I didn't meet anyone there.
Do you want to live in Boston?
Give your passport number and your date of birth.
I'm in need of help.
I can't tell you what happened.
I saw an old woman cross the street.
I don't know what he'll do.
Call Tom and tell him where we are.
She cared for her father until his death.
Both of your daughters are very beautiful.
Have you told Tom?
Tom promised he'd help us on Monday.
Is this really our hotel?
I met her on the street.
Would you be willing to do me a favor?
Tom has no chance of succeeding.
Tom didn't have to apologize.
Call me when you're ready.
She is very proud of her daughter.
Why aren't you already on board the ship?
Is that what Tom told you?
Tom said that he was happy.
Here is a letter for you.
Follow the old river bed for two kilometers.
Tom made a speech.
Leave my car alone.
Most people can't tell the difference.
I agree with Tom a hundred percent.
I know how Tom did that.
"If Tom doesn't tell Mary, I will."
Prepare for combat.
We can't let Tom win.
They're both artists.
I saw Tom entering that restaurant.
Let's have a beer.
Do you know where we live?
Don't ask me what Tom is going to do.
I tried to make an inconspicuous exit from the party.
I didn't know which one to choose.
I thought I told you never to go there alone.
Why is Tom always so happy?
I think that we should try again.
I've seen them before.
"No matter how tired you might be, you have to do it."
I wasn't expecting to see you here.
You look better today.
I told Tom to leave.
"You haven't spoken to Tom about this yet, have you?"
Can you help me do this?
The waiter came over to take Tom's order.
Tom's doing very well.
The root of the problem is a lack of communication between departments.
I didn't think Tom was looking.
Did you know that that's from Australia?
"Have a seat, Tom."
You've told me that already.
I was going to do that.
What else was in the basket?
Everyone does what he wants.
There was nothing Tom could do to stop Mary.
"After three drinks, the man passed out."
I don't quite know what to say.
I'm picky.
What are they doing here together?
Tom appealed to his friends for sympathy.
"Tom smiled at Mary, and she smiled back."
I knew you'd find me.
I just wanted to tell you that I'm really sorry for what I said.
Tom bought a puppy.
I'm not allowed to go to Tom's house.
Perhaps you should do that now.
Give me back my bag.
I'm so glad you came.
I doubt Tom is even interested in trying to learn Russian.
You alone can help me.
Why didn't Tom call?
I didn't know that you were hungry.
I hardly ever wear a hat.
I have found a job.
Tom is teaching me French.
Please give Tom all these toys.
I always knew you could do it.
We can't afford to take chances.
I bought a glass vase.
Tom is a professional skateboarder.
Look what I made.
I can't get the door locked.
I didn't know that Tom liked horror movies.
We'll need help.
The snow is melted.
Tom is apparently a busy man.
She talked about her family.
I come when I can.
You had no choice but to do what Tom told you to do.
Where did Tom find my glasses?
I want you to turn off the radio.
Don't be scared to meet new people.
"Sit down, please, he said."
We think we know where Tom has been.
They are proud of their daughter.
I'm the one who caused all the problems.
I'm not that naïve.
I wanted to hug Tom.
I knew Tom was scared.
How long have you worked in Boston?
I require your assistance.
Why don't you come to the beach with us?
What did Tom give you?
Is this your first time to visit Australia?
I correspond with many friends in Canada.
He has no political ambition.
It's totally true.
Thank you for waiting.
We really have a lot to do.
Don't let anyone press this button.
I'll take the more expensive one.
Tom is the only one who can save the world.
The War of 1812 had begun.
I didn't finish it.
He has a big family.
Tom came to Boston last year.
Do you know what I want?
I need to get to bed.
Tom didn't wait very long.
It's not hopeless.
There were a number of students in the room.
How many years have you studied French?
I want you to go home.
I need to regain my strength.
How many maids does that lady want to employ?
This pizza is cold.
Don't eat without me.
Tom said he liked studying French.
What's so interesting about baseball?
That's a hotel.
"Some people traveled by train, and others by road."
I want to live in either Boston or Chicago.
"It's a little late for that, don't you think?"
Cheese and butter are products made from milk.
Tom asked me where I was going.
When does your winter vacation begin?
I think Tom is safe.
My mother was furious.
"Tom understands what I mean, I think."
There were no radios in Japan in those days.
Stay in this room.
They need him.
I'm shy.
Tom died a year ago.
"I got cold, so I turned on the heater."
A dog seldom bites unless it is attacked.
I didn't know it was a gift.
I used to come here.
Look again.
I didn't mean to disturb you.
Tom wanted Mary to drive him to the airport.
Put on some decent clothes.
I heard a man's voice.
I like French toast.
Why don't you do us all a favor and go back to wherever you came from?
I wouldn't be that optimistic if I were you.
That's what I expected of my daughter.
Everyone makes mistakes sometimes.
I think you like me.
Tom is available.
How many offers did you get?
Nobody wants to play with Tom.
Tom managed to put out the fire by himself.
"If you buy me an ice cream, I'll kiss you."
I don't drive a car.
You should trim your fingernails.
I thought you didn't see anything.
I think Tom is watching me.
He was reading a book at that time.
I usually eat lunch by myself.
You have a message here.
Couldn't Tom have been lying?
Tom spent some time with Mary.
I think I'll be able to stand that.
We need to replace the whole unit.
I came to Australia when I was a child.
You look better in this dress.
Tom walked fast.
I think you'll like it.
We really thought we could do it.
I knew you wouldn't wait.
Tom is trying to find his father.
Please be patient with me today.
Tom spends all day speaking French at school and only speaks English at home.
I have exactly what you need.
Did you manage to call Tom?
What made you do what you did?
Tom is asking permission.
Don't leave me.
Get it away from me.
I'm glad to see that you're happy.
I have an appointment.
Everyone in Tom's class likes him.
You're very unpredictable.
Your dog is very big.
Tom closed the door and he and Mary started kissing.
We won't be leaving town before spring.
I'll be in town.
Why did you switch the light off?
Can you show me where I am on this map?
I hope Tom's wrong.
My cat is sleeping on my bed.
Is it true that Tom doesn't like to sing?
Thank you for replying.
Don't you know what to do?
Don't joke about that.
You're thin.
I don't know when Tom and Mary met.
Tom came three minutes after I called him.
Tom just didn't want to admit that he'd been wrong.
Why are you trying to help me?
Are you friends?
Did you tell Tom?
I banged my elbow against the wall.
Does Tom have a summer house?
Where are you going to sleep?
We won't be able to survive without your help.
It is no use trying to deceive me.
I wish I were rich.
Tom is still in a bad mood.
I think there is a more obvious explanation.
Every day I either ride a bike or get the bus to work.
I'm worried that Tom might get lost.
Your watch gains time.
Her oldest daughter got married.
You said you needed help.
Tom told me to wash my face.
He looks old for his age.
Tom and I used to be friends.
I had difficulty in solving this problem.
I haven't smoked for ages.
Tom is expecting someone.
Why don't you work?
My mother feels better.
Tom has already washed his hands.
I just want to say I'm glad you're here.
They had started earlier than us.
Tom told me to wash my hands.
Ask me a question.
When was the last time you sharpened this knife?
Tom lives three blocks from the beach.
Do you have a pair of tweezers?
Nobody knows what happened.
I think that I know your brother.
Tom would be happy to know you've finally come.
Would you like to hear more?
Do you really want Tom to help?
Tom is aware of it now.
I think that will be all for today.
Have I offended you?
The matter does not concern me.
Were you able to sit down?
Do you work on Mondays?
A business cycle is a recurring succession of periods of prosperity and periods of depression.
You shouldn't have lent money to Tom.
Please come inside.
He didn't mean to hurt you.
I made that decision by myself.
Tom rarely complains.
She goes to school.
I'm trying to fix it.
Tom told us to get in the car.
I'm still young.
What happened to your car?
You're going to be late for school again.
They're trying to scare us.
Do you really think it's impossible?
Tom has been doing that all week.
The glass was broken by someone.
We are students.
Where did you first meet Tom?
Tom and Mary need to buy some things.
What happened to your ankle?
It's impossible.
His speech was not altogether bad.
It's partly my fault.
Tom always break things.
I'll take you there someday.
Do you really know?
We caught a glimpse of the castle from the window of our train.
The plane took off and was soon out of sight.
I can easily touch my toes.
Don't worry about that.
I don't remember how I did that.
You have something stuck in your teeth.
"As a result of the war, many people died."
Nuclear power is used to generate electricity.
Thanks for the offer.
She's trying on a coat.
Tom said he doesn't know exactly what time he's going to get here.
Tom is willing to help us.
I was born in Kyoto in 1980.
Which one will they choose?
Climb to the top.
I repair computers almost every day.
Wasn't it supposed to be hot today?
That's the silliest thing I've ever heard.
Who wrote to Tom?
I can't remember the last time I spoke to Tom.
Can I be of any service to you?
"I'd love to go, but I can't."
Tom won the triathlon.
It's your duty to vote.
I work in a hospital.
I was going to see Tom.
I don't have a good memory.
Take another look.
Marry me.
I leave for Boston tomorrow.
His speech moved us.
I prefer to ride a bike.
I thought you were a scientist.
Tom said that he's not hungry.
Did you find Tom?
How can this be done?
Tom was too busy to notice what was happening.
I don't think that I deserved the punishment I got.
I slept on the couch last night.
That isn't going to help.
Tom may be taking drugs.
What have you bought Tom for Christmas?
I'm short of breath.
This is the strongest dog that I have ever seen.
Tom and Mary live under the same roof.
Don't be like that.
Could you take me home?
I'd like to sing a song for you that I just wrote.
Please go.
There's not a big difference.
Bring your wife.
Is anyone in there?
Didn't you know that Tom died in Australia?
Please be home by three o'clock.
I need a good French-English dictionary.
What're you trying to do?
I peeled the apple.
Why is truth important?
Your French is improving.
That's why Tom left.
"I am near-sighted, so I cannot make out what is written on that signboard."
We're not lost. I know where we are.
I'm now unarmed.
Are you seriously thinking about going?
Is there something in the fridge we can drink?
There's no one here who can deal with the problem.
Tom switched on the TV.
I didn't know what I would do.
Tom told me he was hungry.
The police have verified Tom's alibi.
Tom could hear Mary crying.
Where will we eat breakfast today?
Tom is going to be back in the morning.
How many eggs are there in the kitchen?
Originally they were farmers.
Tom knew exactly where he needed to go.
We've got to get Tom out of there.
Is Tom still married to Mary?
"Close the door, please."
Let's go out.
I didn't see what happened.
I'm sure Tom is grateful for your help.
Do you want me to call a doctor?
You scared the children.
I wanted to tell you how sorry I am.
I always know when you're lying.
Tom could go to jail for three years.
I turned the lights out.
Tom wasn't very sleepy.
You only have one choice.
Don't ask me not to sing.
Don't lecture me.
"That's $7.65, please."
I've already apologized for that.
Mine is over there.
We used the computer in order to save time.
Don't speak to Tom like that.
I remember his face but I can't remember his name.
I sang at church.
That's against the rules.
Why did Tom come to you?
Please don't worry about me.
That never changes.
We're going to work tonight.
I have to stay in bed all day.
He is anything but a fool.
That's why I like you.
Tom's passport has expired.
Where are you stationed?
I thought that you liked pancakes.
I could be away for some time.
I saw a hippopotamus at the zoo.
Don't ever change.
She kept on talking.
Didn't you get a postcard from Tom?
Don't talk to me like this.
I had a bad stomachache.
Tom leaves his radio on all day.
I gave in to her demands.
Were you happy?
I know you wouldn't do that.
Tom could've been lying.
Tom obviously likes hearing himself talk.
"By the way, have you heard from her since then?"
My father told me not to read books in bed.
Tom was here all day.
What are Tom and Mary complaining about?
Tom seemed embarrassed.
Tom went again.
Tom was like a dad to me.
Did you sign it?
Wipe your nose.
I'm on time.
What else do you know?
They won't believe you.
Tom never wrote Mary back.
I felt guilty.
Do you know what's in that box?
Let's get together.
May God reward you.
I knew we were going to be friends.
A lot has happened since that time.
I didn't know Tom at all.
The door opened suddenly.
Did you go to church last Sunday?
Tom says that Mary will win.
I got suspicious.
Tom didn't see it.
That's not going to fly with Tom.
Tom pocketed the money.
The English are generally a conservative people.
What you say does not make any sense to me.
Tom is beginning to go deaf.
You shouldn't go.
It's raining outside.
The government is promoting the use of domestically made products.
We shouldn't be doing this.
Tom threw Mary's phone into the pool.
Tom doesn't care about money.
It's time.
The glass is full of water.
It isn't that windy today.
You have come at an opportune time.
Everyone says that the food at this restaurant is very good.
World war two broke out in 1939.
Do you have a favorite restaurant in Boston?
We decided to stay with Tom.
Keep the change.
How can you be so cruel?
Tom says he wasn't here yesterday. It must've been someone else.
We all had the same idea.
What have you got in that box?
"That's true, too."
Isn't that romantic?
I can't pay them.
Is Tom hungry?
I knew Tom wouldn't be afraid.
I couldn't meet him at the station because my car ran out of gas.
They refused to help us.
Tom told Mary an interesting story.
Broccoli is one of the healthiest vegetables.
There's a hole in my coat.
Tom did his duty.
Tom can't walk on his own yet.
We were ready.
She did not keep her promise to write to me.
How did you know that Tom could play the piano?
She was angry. That is why she remained silent.
Does Tom have a big family?
I need Tom to do a couple of things for me.
We have arrived.
Tom doesn't know where his French textbook is.
Tom seems to be an honest person.
I need to speak with you.
Tom says he hates weddings.
Tom seems to know who won.
I didn't know that Tom would be here.
We tricked Tom.
My birthday is coming up.
I don't quite understand what you want to say.
You know Tom can't win.
They say this old house is haunted.
Odette was born in Nantes in 1905.
Let me carry your bag.
Let me show it to you.
Don't act like you don't know what's happening.
This is really bad.
Where did you buy your book bag?
I'm always busy on Mondays.
Wash your hands with soap.
What if your parents find out?
I know that you were the one who did that.
Tom will be able to solve the problem.
This key won't work because it's bent.
I can't see you.
"I needed your help, but I couldn't find you."
I'll call you later today.
Now's the perfect time to do that.
I listen to everything.
I saw them kissing.
"Tom could be a big help to you, I think."
I didn't know you then.
That's what I said.
I'll drive you to the airport if you want me to.
Do you have time for one more question?
Don't make me laugh!
I saw Tom yesterday and he looked sad.
Tom has finished eating.
I've never seen Tom smile.
He runs in the park every day.
It is very kind of you to send me such a nice present.
Do you have any idea who did this?
We adjourned the meeting until the following Friday.
Tom bought Mary a box of chocolates.
I know when Tom's birthday is.
I don't know how to dance.
One of her cars is blue and the others are red.
Haven't I suffered enough?
I dreamed about you.
I reminded him of his interview with the president.
Does Tom come here on Mondays?
Are you calling me a coward?
Are they talking about Tom?
Tom and I've started dating.
We have a signed agreement.
Spanish is her native language.
I'm sure we'll miss Tom a lot.
Were you at the beach all summer?
Tom earns three times as much as me.
I've got a flight back to Boston booked for this evening.
Tom arrived at 2:30.
"Let me help, too."
I'll never forget the sound the crash made.
I'm coming back.
Tom was still awake at 2:30 in the morning.
I got up at six this morning.
"You weren't kidding, were you?"
This is something I don't understand.
Let's leave the room.
Nobody understands why I'm so scared.
Don't blame yourselves for what happened.
I answered all Tom's questions.
I'm surprised that Tom isn't here.
Tom says he's never heard Mary sing.
I was here all day.
I should've left Tom a note.
Is your school co-educational?
"Where is your house? ""It is over there."""
Tom likes oranges and eats three or four a week.
Tom slept on the air mattress.
The old castle stands on the hill.
I sell cars in Boston.
Tom's birthday is October twentieth.
We can't be certain they're Canadians.
"Tom didn't want to do that, but he did."
She is a good tennis player.
I have great news.
I can't bear this pain.
I didn't know that you had so much money.
Drink some water.
I know everything now.
Tom got wet to the skin.
I am not a monster.
"Because of the rain, we had to eat our picnic inside."
"I bought a camera, but I lost it the next day."
What are you planning on cooking for dinner tomorrow?
Tom and I've been married for three years now.
I told Tom to wait in the car.
Why do you think Tom was absent today?
I don't know much about you.
I'm still not married.
Do you also like jazz?
That was Tom's own fault.
I can't believe you're getting married.
Can you decode it?
Tom is leaving in thirty minutes.
This job shouldn't take more than a couple of hours.
You look younger.
Mary is charming.
His most important adviser was Henry Kissinger.
You look like a tourist.
Tom has already been told not to leave.
He bought me a nice camera.
Will you teach me how to swim?
I can't tolerate this anymore.
He is proud of his collection.
That's so hard.
Can I pay later?
We're serious.
It looks like you're scared.
Tom told me what happened.
I asked if you wanted a ride.
Everybody's happy.
This is the only pair of shoes I have.
What time did you arrive?
Didn't you know Tom and Mary were married?
Tom almost won.
Do you consider yourself to be a lucky person?
I think I could learn a lot from you.
Could you read this for me?
I need to get a pen.
What a heartbreaking story!
Do you think Tom can be trusted?
I don't know how old Tom is.
Tom and I don't do that very often.
Tom is under suspicion.
"I wanted to do that last week, but didn't have the time."
Here are some idioms.
Tom and Mary have gone home.
Tom and Mary have announced their engagement.
You don't have to apologize.

I don't have any objection to that.
Why can't we all just get along?
What did Tom ask you?
He got home at six.

She spends every Saturday afternoon playing tennis.
Now let's go.
I washed my feet.
Tom is supposed to be in Boston.
Tom and Mary are still in love.
Where are you going for the summer?
You should call your parents more often.
What color is your mother's hair?
He's about the same age as you are.
Do they know about us?
This isn't ours.
Tom wants to meet Mary again.
I'll take one.
"If you keep practicing, you'll soon get the feel of it."
Why don't we take a walk?
I don't want that happening.
I am not always free on Sundays.
You should call Tom as soon as possible.
You don't need my approval.
Let's do it this way.
He crossed the street.
There are no classes in August.
Give me the bottle.
The doctor's on his way.
I don't know why Tom doesn't want me to go.
Tom fed his dog table scraps.
Be generous.
Your anger is understandable.
I'm fed up with her.

The library will issue you a library card.
The police are after him.
Who was in your car?
I'd like to see you more often.
It wasn't you.
I was taking a bath.
It's depressing in here.
Only a few people showed up on time.
I'd like you to get me a cup of coffee.
I don't know what it's for.
Tom wasn't very busy today.
I'm trying to find the person who owns this guitar.
"I would gladly help you, only I am too busy now."
Have a little patience.
Which game do you want to play?
How could I've forgotten that?
Why do you have to go?
I'd rather not talk about it here.
Are you two dating each other?
The river is no longer as clean as it used to be.
Tom realized Mary was tired.
Tom is looking for his parents.
You'd better take an umbrella with you.

What's your favorite programming language?

I remember what you said.
Tom and Mary exchanged numbers at the party.
Don't betray me.
How did you learn about what happened here yesterday afternoon?
Let me get this straight.
They cannot stop us.
We could wait.
Tom detests Mary.
I didn't try to resist.
How many days did it take you to do that?
It's on my desk.
I know Tom has lied to us.

Is it possible we've made a mistake?
You'd be stupid to trust Tom.

I love sitting on the beach.
I want to go to the zoo.
Each of their opinions has both good points and bad points.
Tom isn't nuts.
Rush hour traffic will start soon.
I haven't eaten for days.
I went to the beach last weekend.

I got nothing.
I remember them.

Was it necessary?

Come take a look.
I'd like to hear that.
I can make a distinction between good and bad.
I want to have my breakfast.
Did Tom hurt you?
"When all you have is a hammer, every problem starts to look like a nail."
His work merits the highest praise.
"If that man makes one more mistake, I'll fire him."
Tell them to introduce themselves.
We couldn't afford it.
Tom is calling from his cellphone.
Had you been drinking?
She gave birth to twins.
He is only a child.
I wonder what Tom wants to do.
I think Tom should see this.
I don't think that Tom knows that I love Mary.
What else could it mean?
This first question is for you.
Tom thought that Mary was sleeping.
It looks strange.
You can call me Tom if you want.
"You wouldn't be lying to me, would you?"
The kitten wanted in.
Three were sentenced to life in prison.
They were very hungry.
I'm still not hungry.
You lied to me.

Tom left the house while we were still sleeping.
I want to know who called.
We couldn't open the door because it was locked from the inside.
When do you usually listen to music?
I thought Tom was upset.
It's well done.
This is boring.

Those sunglasses are mine.
This is for my friend.
Who knows what you saw?
It's no secret that Tom doesn't agree with you.

Do not disturb her.
The world is full of idiots.
Let me add water.
She is his friend.
I'm tired now.
Tom bent over Mary's corpse.
I know that you won't be here tomorrow.
At least I tried to do something.
I want you to listen to me carefully.
How did Tom help?
Tom is our leader.
Stop goofing off and finish your work.
Can't we leave it as it is?
Why didn't you show me this before?
She advised him not to buy a used car.
Tom told me he was free.
"I had a couple of questions, but I didn't ask them."
You don't have to get up so early.
I guess so.
"Although he is rich, he is not happy."
We have everything we need already.

I want you to watch this video.
"Which color do you prefer, blue or green?"

Tom isn't very smart.
He looked left and right.
He decided to give up smoking once and for all.
"You didn't go by yourself, did you?"
Why haven't you gone to the police?
Tom stayed in Boston last year.
Tom did that for his family.
How many people are you planning on inviting?
He drank beer.
I've been here a lot longer than Tom has.
This is fundamentally unfair.
I'll take care of that right away.
Tom has written three books.
At least six hundred men died in action.
Don't you feel it?
You're going to have to deal with that.
The ladder was covered with mud.
No one likes losing.
Tom was signing autographs in front of the theater.

The stadium is being evacuated.
What do you intend to do with it?

I'm leaving at 2:30.
That's how we became friends.
Tom's favorite movie is Dumbo.
Am I a good teacher?
I'd like to talk to the manager.
Did you know Tom used to be a French teacher?
Tom can't decide which approach to take.

That's why we were there.
Who asked you to sing?
It's your responsibility to finish the job.
What do you want to drink?
It'll snow tomorrow.
Has anyone tried this before?
Tom scored three points.
I want to avoid rush hour.
I'm not surprised.
The room was full of smoke.
Your dog is over there.
I'm starting to see what you mean.
I don't think that I'm the problem.
I'm grieving.
I don't think Tom knows how to drive.
He likes anything sweet.
I didn't like beer at that time.
I bet Tom can't tell the difference.
Didn't you know Tom was going to go to Boston tomorrow?
You're sitting in my seat.
Tom won't be in for a few weeks.
I have to buy one.
Tom has a growth on his arm.
I'm going to stay there for about a week.
I just want to find Tom.
Even Tom didn't agree.
"Can Tom go, too?"
Tom wanted to ask you a few questions.
You can't trust what she says.
Tom turned red with embarrassment.
The bus was completely full.
I'm not looking for a favor.
I am starting this evening.
They're on their lunch break.
Do you really want to know why I didn't do what you asked me to do?
They told me I had to help you.
I washed my T-shirt.
Why did you say that to Tom?
That cake was delicious.
Your suitcase is too heavy.
I may have met her somewhere.
Tom has already said that he'll help us.
We don't know what Jesus looked like.
Tom was fast asleep.
Who do you know in Boston?
Tom and Mary aren't leaving.
Tom has a terrible crush on Mary.
It's for a friend of mine.
I made him do so.
Tom eats less than Mary.
This just doesn't make sense.
Thanks for the suggestions.
Is the meeting today or tomorrow?
It's unlikely Tom will help us.
No one's going to help you.
"Do you think he'll come? ""I hope not."""
I go to work at seven o'clock.
You're not going to win.
Do you mind waiting?
Tom spent three years in Australia.
I need a police car.
Why was Tom hugging Mary?
Leather shoes cost much more.
You're a kind man.
I like small towns.
I've got a son.
Who found you?
I was horrible.
Who will play the role of the princess?
Tom didn't care what Mary did.
Times were hard.
Do you hear it?
"You have no idea who I am, do you?"
"If Tom finds out that I told you this, he'll be very angry."
The fire is spreading.
Did you read this?
I know why you aren't going with us.
Tom says that he'll never do that.
Take care.
I arrived in Boston last night.
We didn't hear you come in.
I know that you're hungry.
Everyone was looking at you.
You broke the law.
Great men are not always wise.
You were in danger.
You stay put.
I went to school with your brother.
I want to know if you'll be free tomorrow.
I advised him to give up smoking.
Let's stop somewhere to eat.
I always wanted to be a writer.
Tom's wish was granted.
Tom said that he felt nothing.
You have our full support.
Neither Tom nor Mary has a bicycle.
You may kiss me if you like.
Aren't you coming to the party tomorrow?
I have a solution.
Why's it so cold in here?
Drink whatever you want.
When does the bank open?
They recognized you.
Finding time to do that won't be easy.
We sat in the very back of the auditorium.
She was trembling with fear.
When are you going to Europe?
Go back to your seat.
The bar is always open.
You must help Tom.
That's ridiculous!
I went camping with my family.
No one will find us here.
I know you needed to do that.
I heard you are going to get married.
Tom bought a nice house in Boston.
I taught Tom how to drive.
I don't think you're ready.
Tom gave half his money to charity.
The first thing Tom does when he meets a new woman is check to see if she's wearing a wedding ring.
He can't be hungry. He's just had lunch.
I hate that color.
"Pick on somebody your own size, you bully."
I didn't say you could go.
How long does it take to get to Boston?
Do you know something I don't know?
I promise you won't regret it.
What are you doing in a place like this?
Tom will be back from Australia soon.
Tom boiled an egg for breakfast.
I suspect Tom and Mary aren't in Australia now.
Tom reluctantly obeyed.
A penny saved is a penny earned.
Everyone is watching you.
I think Tom forgot his camera.
Tom gave me some books.
He drank detergent by accident.
This meal is adequate for three.
Tom didn't understand me.
I didn't kiss Tom.
Don't be a busybody.
Why are you so hard-headed?
Have you been told about the problem?
I don't remember Tom asking us to do that.
My client never should've been arrested.
I have caught a cold.
He was successful in several areas.
When are you going to tell Tom?
Have you heard about Tom?
Tom's hardly likely to admit that he's wrong.
This knife needs to be sharpened.
Tom is alive and well.
Hamlet is a play by Shakespeare.
We're glad you're back.
Could we have a table in the corner?
Do you have a cough?
Did anyone call me?
You'll like Tom.
I was very proud of that.
I think it's time for me to go to bed.
I hope Tom knows how to fix this.
I often have to bring my work home.
I did not take anything from his bag.
Tom asked Mary where her mother was.
Tom slept much longer than he had planned to.
Tom is just an ordinary guy.
I can't lend this book to you.
Tom told me that he never wanted to work for his father.
Tom accused Mary of stealing his wallet.
We're winners.
Tom can be such a jerk.
"Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me."
No weapons were found.
The sun is up.
Let's talk about what went wrong.
Tom decided to marry Mary.
My mom told me the same thing.
Tom says he hasn't thought about it yet.
Tom says he wants to apologize to Mary for doing that.
I never lied to Tom.
I can't sleep with the lights on.
I can't do this.
I'm trying to fix it.
Tom doesn't have to help us if he doesn't want to.
Do they remember me?
Don't expect miracles.
Do we have any bread?
I'm getting sick and tired of this.
Tom ate a carrot.
It's only a matter of time.
I've run out of milk.
I didn't know your mother lived with you.
Tom told Mary not to do that.
Do you like to study?
We've been dating three years.
I think about her a lot.
"Times may change, but human nature stay the same."
Can you remember how much you paid for this?
I've waited too long for this.
Everyone began to laugh.
Were you an officer in the army?
I didn't want to swim.
I want to get a haircut before I go on the trip.
I never read in bed.
This incessant noise drives me mad.
I wasn't supposed to tell you that.
We must help all of them.
I think she's 40 years old.
Tom wants to buy a small house on Park Street.
Who called you?
Don't make so much noise.
There are no new messages in my inbox.
Her father is a policeman.
I knew that Tom would be back.
Tom's parents are older than Mary's parents.
I live in comfort.
Do it while you can.
They're replacing the rotten piles under the bridge.
Shouldn't we leave?
Do you have any news?
It was a lost opportunity.
Do you think you could fall in love with me?
How long will you be away?
Oil has been discovered under the North Sea.
Please promise me you won't do that.
"Which do you usually drink, wine or beer?"
Tom said that he liked Mary.
Many railroads have been replaced by highways.
You should tell Tom yourself.
I knew Tom a long time.
A penguin is a bird that cannot fly.
Tom hasn't paid this month's rent yet.
Tom wanted Mary to help him in the garden.
We're not breaking any laws.
"Tom is disappointed, but Mary isn't."
He insulted me without reason.
I was not pleased by your rude behavior.
Take that away.
I regret having said so.
Tom speaks with Mary every day.
I know where we are.
Wait till six.
Did you think I wouldn't tell Tom?
Tom told Mary that he wasn't happy.
What makes you think I'm going to help you?
I didn't know you used to live in Boston.
Tom owns a hunting rifle.
How many other cars does Tom own?
What were we talking about?
Please do not forget.
I can't ever be what you were.
I think I'm in love with you.
How long will you be doing this?
I've just started doing that.
I live pretty close to Tom.
His letter makes me uneasy.
The sick child sat up in bed.
The music is too loud.
Tom watches TV all the time.
I was as surprised as Tom was.
Take the same road home that you came on.
Tom would help you if you asked him to.
Can I borrow your umbrella?
I enjoyed talking to Tom.
The kidnappers gagged Tom and locked him up in a closet.
It is necessary.
That boy is running.
Don't wait till the last minute.
I think it's an important event.
Now is not the time.
What did you do to me?
How many cups of tea do you drink per day?
We've been through a lot together.
This piano needs to be tuned.
Tom wouldn't make Mary do that.
I've already fixed that.
"Have I broken a law, officer?"
They all looked at Tom.
Tom asked me to tell you something.
I want it to stop.
I won't forgive you if you do it again.
I saw you at the flower shop.
Why are you going?
What would you do if you were here now?
Stop showing off!
Can you see any difference between these?
Don't lie.
This tea is too sweet.
Have you called Tom?
Can you ski well?
Rabbits breed quickly.
I'm not insane.
I graduated from Harvard.
You are not supposed to smoke at school.
I think that was really bad.
Tom has enormous potential.
I know what those guys want.
We wouldn't like to lose you.
Please don't tell anyone that I did that.
I'm sorry. That's all I really remember.
Some of them are my friends.
What were you two arguing about?
We're really lucky.
Tom thinks I'm jealous.
Am I overreacting?
"These cookies aren't expensive, but they taste good."
I'll show my album to you.
"What you have is a common cold, not the flu."
Tom won three races in a row.
Do you like the taste of beer?
Tom wanted Mary to take his picture.
You and I made a bargain.
You're so tense.
Don't believe everything you hear about me.
Don't wake the baby.
Tom assured Mary that he'd help her paint the ceiling of her kitchen.
You don't know what you're doing.
I don't normally lie.
Do you know why Tom wasn't here yesterday?
I hear you got married again.
We're looking for the treasure.
You must give up smoking.
We work from nine to five.
I'll meet you at the usual place.
Have you tried online dating?
This pizza is delicious.
I know her very well.
Tom won't be wearing a tie.
Give me another chance.
The theater is empty.
You left the iron on.
Tom has been trying to lower his expenses.
He often watches TV.
That's what we want.
Tom smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.
This letter has no signature.
I was told that I should stay away from Tom.
Tom is probably hungry.
My brother will kill me.
This horse kicks when anyone comes up from behind.
Will you go to Boston by car?
You're too hard on yourself.
Tom and Mary survived.
The future looked very gloomy.
My father-in-law is an engineer.
Everyone's doing something different.
Why are you trying to scare me?
You did that on purpose.
What kind of trouble is Tom in?
I accompanied her on a walk.
I wish I were wrong.
Nothing can stop them.
You have to hurry up.
When was the last time you went to a barber.
You have to get rid of it.
I came to say hi.
Tom has told us so much about you.
Where were you this morning?
How has that helped you in this job?
I need a quiet place to think.
Tom is the only one who knows how to do that.
Tom has been talking to Mary about me.
I must buy a new pair of shoes.
This sentence hasn't yet been translated.
Would you like me to order it?
Is the dog yours?
Tom isn't the only one who came to help.
Tom said Mary didn't want to go to the concert.
"I have about 5,000 yen."
I parked my car behind Tom's.
Can you touch your toes without bending your legs?
The police caught Tom.
What you are saying doesn't make sense.
Do you think it had something to do with Tom?
Do you understand the difference?
I didn't expect this.
Mary went to Boston where she met the man of her dreams.
How did you get to know him?
Tom does like you. I'm sure of it.
Where will you put it?
Why are you asking me these questions?
You're a big help.
We're nonsmokers.
Did you find Tom?
I was not sure what to do.
I can't tell you about what happened.
I didn't wash my hair.
Did you climb trees when you were a child?
Tom suddenly got very angry.
I'll bring it to you tomorrow.
He took an oral examination.
I'll go and get you something to eat.
Tom said Mary was upset.
Please give me some airsickness medicine.
Do you have any sunscreen?
We're sinking.
Are you sure Tom didn't win?
Tom's grandfather was a concentration camp survivor.
Do you want to wait in the car?
Did you pass the test?
Tom's not at all sure.
I have a lot of friends that can speak French well.
How do you feel about what she said?
I don't think that's fair.
Let's get out of here before it's too late.
Tom said Mary looked tired.
Try to be polite.
I like making model airplanes.
I've upset you.
I really feel it's a red herring.
Tom doesn't know where Mary graduated from.
Who do you want to travel with?
Tom and Mary are nice kids.
Nobody thinks you're a coward.
Tom worked hard all summer.
I bought a book about animals.
Don't you dare touch anything.
I washed it.
I'm not used to this kind of work.
Don't walk home alone.
Mary has a pretty smile and is always very friendly.
Don't you think we should tell Tom about this?
I love the way you hold me.
I accept that challenge.
Tom didn't feel like playing golf.
Tom has already been told to do that again.
We have to stay positive.
You're required by law to appear in person.
We went to the café that I told you about.
That's a very pretty blouse.
Was it you that left the door open last night?
There is nothing to be proud of.
Don't be so slow.
Is this our hotel?
I went in the direction my friend indicated.
Is there snow on top of the mountain?
"No matter how rich a man is, he cannot buy love."
You'll soon get used to it.
I invited him to my house.
No one is going to die.
You're too picky.
"Excuse me, where's the bathroom?"
"I can't sleep. ""Me neither."""
He is still young.
Tom didn't have to speak French.
Tom poured us some tea.
It's just a toy.
"Can I have the next one, please?"
You should probably speak a little bit slower.
You probably don't even remember me.
You're all racists.
You didn't sign all the documents.
He left ten minutes ago.
Tom's story had a happy ending.
"He doesn't know it yet, but he's already dead."
"When push comes to shove, a family will close ranks to protect one of their own."
I just want you to know that I regret doing that.
Are you planning to go to Boston with Tom?
I know something they don't know.
They traveled by car.
Just take mine.
It's a pity you couldn't come.
My younger brother is still sleeping.
These are his pens.
There's no place like home.
Tom heard Mary snoring in the next room.
I don't want to go anywhere.
You did not answer my question.
Tom and I encouraged each other.
I will stay there.
Tom returned the book to the library.
How many times do I have to say it?
I drove them home.
Why is everybody shouting?
Who fell?
Your time's up.
I arrived here a few minutes before you.
It was worth every penny.
You should explain it to me.
It's useless to talk to her. She won't listen to you.
I asked Tom not to wait for us.
Could you help us translate this text?
You can drive this car with one hand.
Tom told us to do that.
I don't think there is any excuse for Tom's behavior.
He advised her not to go.
Could you please tell Tom that I need his help?
What scared you?
I want you to have fun.
We are finally free.
Please write down what I say.
My ears hurt.
Please tell us what happened.
I got your message.
I've really missed you.
How did you know I was hungry?
You must do that tomorrow.
Would you like to stay for lunch?
Can't you lower your voice?
They all stopped and looked at Tom.
I didn't buy anything.
I drank tea yesterday.
Where are you going to spend the night?
Tom crossed the border.
I'm not being paid enough.
Was there something you wanted to ask me?
I heard that Tom is back in town.
I feel like I've been reborn.
That's why we're going.
I have to think of the future.
Tom only does what I tell him to do.
"Even though I studied French for three years in school, I'm not good at speaking it."
I drove the car.
We're used to that.
Have you ever gone through the Straits of Magellan?
Tom wiped away his tears.
Tom never actually lived in Boston.
He kicked in a lot of money.
Take your trousers off.
It's not too late to change your mind.
We climbed Mt. Fuji last summer.
Get out!
"At the moment, it's all I can say."
It was not clear what she really meant.
Tom has a bicycle.
Tom went to the hospital.
Don't expect it to happen this year.
Tom doesn't think that Mary did all her homework by herself.
I'm pretty sure Tom lives on Park Street.
Can you tell me about what happened?
I've seen the way you look at Tom.
How many boxes are there?
Tom doesn't want anything.
I went to the zoo yesterday.
I'll be in Boston.
We shouldn't have bought this car.
No one knew what Tom was planning to do.
Why didn't you just tell us?
Let me show you how to use this washing machine.
I wanted to talk to you.
How long did it take us to translate this book?
I won't let them hurt you.
Mary is the only girl I've ever loved.
I'll find someone.
Can you open this door?
She applied to him for help.
I wish I had not bought such a useless thing.
I think you know that that's impossible.
I write when I can.
Tom guessed that Mary was around thirty years old.
I'm sure things will work out.
Tom's lucky.
"Without the sun, there would be no life."
Let's swim out to the float.
Have you ever tried telling a joke in French?
Are you going to be OK?
I'm sure somebody will do that.
I didn't know Tom couldn't speak French at all.
How many more classes do you have today?
There's something funny going on here.
Have you spent much time in Boston?
I think that that's wrong.
Russia is facing great financial difficulties.
Tom lives in a large house.
Won't you join us?
"I'll always love you, no matter what happens."
Tom needs Mary's help.
The problem was too difficult for us to solve without help.
I told Tom the truth.
Is it right that you and I should fight?
I don't drink before noon.
"As a pianist, he's much better than I am."
Tom said he didn't want me to worry about that.
Tom will miss his flight.
We caught you.
You need to wake up.
It almost never snows here.
I'm busy preparing for the trip.
I'm sure that Tom won't be here this afternoon.
Are you sure you're ready to do this?
Tom claims he didn't cry.
Tom set the bird free.
Do you think I look happy?
Tom listens to Mary.
He tried to stand up.
People are looking at us.
Where is the tourist information office?
Tom went by himself.
I'll keep your secret.
That's not going to be easy.
We're not going to stop here.
Tom said he didn't want me to go.
"As far as I know, Tom doesn't have a girlfriend."
Tom is lying to you.
You have three messages.
Why do you need to leave today?
Tom has long blond hair and blue eyes.
I need you to help me find it.
What's your favorite place in Boston?
Tom usually eats alone.
Tell everybody.
That's an excellent question.
I went back to work.
She went to the movies by herself.
It finally happened.
I never knew I needed you so much.
Tom isn't like the others.
The two teams fought very hard.
People are more important than money.
Tom wanted me to come.
"Come back here, you coward."
How often do you edit your profile?
He works from Monday to Friday.
Today's October twentieth.
He spent the evening reading a book.
Tom left town.
"If you need to do that, then do it."
Tom can't see well even with glasses.
I tried to do it quickly.
Who else knew you were here?
Let's go play basketball in the park.
Tom will be out for a while.
I came to see Tom.
How many Christmas presents did you get this year?
You're inventive.
Tell me why you think that.
That's a useful piece of information.
The new secretary types faster than the old one.
Go and play with your friends.
Tom told me not to go there anymore.
Do you know the man standing on the bridge?
It helps.
A good memory is his weapon.
We haven't decided yet.
I tore my jacket on a nail.
Can I call you a cab?
Look around.
He asked me if I liked mathematics.
Tom peeked around the corner.
I said I didn't know Tom.
"If you want to do that, do it."
I hope Tom doesn't read this.
Tom asked me to do that very carefully.
Not everyone agrees with you.
Tom turned red as a beet.
They had different ideas.
Your mother must've been beautiful when she was young.
I promise not to disappoint you.
What do you plan on buying Tom for Christmas?
We probably won't do that.
I think I need to do something to help Tom.
Tom came to ask for help.
Who's first?
It's not that deep.
That's why no one wants to work with you.
We really do need Tom's help.
Tom said he didn't want a drink.
You're too weak.
I want to know everything about it.
Tom loves to sing in the shower.
I'm glad to help you.
I want to give you something rare.
Let me take a look.
Do you want this one or that one?
"Of course, I'll keep my promise."
Please help yourself to some apple pie.
I want the same.
We can take you to Boston with us.
Tom was the last to find out about it.
Stop blaming yourself.
Tom will come back from Australia in October.
"Tom tried to kiss Mary, but she backed away."
I like the sound of your voice.
Poor health prohibited him from traveling.
I'm not afraid of snakes.
Tom and Mary have a son.
Is Tom sleeping?
The man who lives next door to me is a doctor.
Tom is afraid to go to the dentist.
This took place on the following day.
I have a package here for you.
"Ready or not, the exam begins in ten minutes."
"When the teacher entered, everyone stood up."
I like windsurfing.
"In times like this, we should all pull together."
How many dictionaries do you have?
I never was mean to Tom.
"There's nothing like a glass of natural, freshly squeezed juice."
"If you're not out of the shower in five minutes, I'm cutting the hot water!"
The house started shaking.
I'll try to reason it out.
Do we have to go?
It's your duty.
I can't allow you to do that yet.
I've done enough harm already.
Does Tom know that you're not going to do that?
We just relaxed and had fun.
Who's paying for this?
Are you free on Tuesday?
She probably knows.
I'll be sure to tell Tom you said that.
Who went with Tom?
Tom is picking oranges.
Will you help me with my homework?
I killed them all.
"Generally speaking, little girls are fond of dolls."
Can I change the channel?
Maybe you didn't understand Tom.
I could kill you.
How much does Tom earn a month?
I confiscated it.
Is everyone happy?
I need to say something.
Tom and Mary usually speak French to each other.
It's very tempting.
How long have you been a teacher?
Why is that so funny?
Tom is going to be in Boston next Monday.
I did nothing.
He took out his handkerchief.
Where did you put the ketchup?
Tell me how to use the washing machine.
We were surprised by Tom's behavior.
I'm not going to eat that.
You are surrounded.
"There are times when you need to fight for what's right, even at the risk of your own life."
Tom won't be difficult to find.
I won't return.
Tom didn't know that Mary was already dead.
I think you know why I'm here.
When exactly do you need do that?
Applicants must be under thirty years old.
Tom is shorter than his father.
You should've left earlier.
I wish that you hadn't told that story to my mother.
That's all that matters.
They're going to have a party next week.
Tom's hair is thinning.
I haven't slept.
"Since I didn't receive a reply, I wrote to her again."
Are you sure you want this?
Please don't ask me about this again.
"In all probability, we'll arrive before them."
She really takes after her mother.
Where did you sleep last night?
He breathed his last breath.
Your fingerprints were on the gun.
I almost always eat oatmeal for breakfast.
That's all I needed to hear.
Tom won't listen to Mary's advice.
Tom and Mary want to have children.
I haven't showered in three days.
I suppose I'd do the same thing if I were you.
"Tom will win, won't he?"
Do you want to say anything to Tom?
Tom is a good friend.
Her hair is tangled.
Her dress was torn.
Tom tried to teach Mary how to play bridge.
Tom has been busy.
I know Tom's secret.
I'm actually here on business.
This store closes at nine in the evening.
I doubt if anyone has told Tom yet.
I had them both.
How many books do you think you have read so far?
We never go to places like that.
We need more firewood.
"Without you, I am nothing."
We didn't get your letter until yesterday.
I've been sick for a very long time.
Tom said that he didn't know where Mary lived.
Tom and Mary said that they were leaving.
Let's ask if it's true.
I was terrified.
Don't stare at people.
Tom is prepared to kill you.
I sometimes visit my friends' homes.
Every penny counts.
My boyfriend is a journalist.
How can you be so cruel?
I've known Tom all my life.
I ate with my parents.
Shy students often receive lower grades.
Please get out of here.
Tom had his car stolen early last week.
Why are you not helping Tom?
You're a lot older than Tom is.
Do as I told you.
Tom tried to trick us.
"If Tom wants to go, I can't stop him."
"Far from hesitating, she willingly offered to help me."
Tom is going blind.
How many passengers are on this plane?
I have to agree with Tom.
Mary is scantily clad.
Didn't you hear the doorbell?
Be careful with it.
Nobody came to the party.
Stay where I can see you.
I didn't want a party.
Tom wants his umbrella back.
I heard voices on the other side of the door.
"If it's a boy, I want to name the baby Tom."
I am often in difficulties.
Would you like me to order it?
Most people in the village objected to the plan.
We've got to find another way to get in.
We haven't met yet.
You have to appear in person.
No one followed Tom.
I'll be back next week.
I never mentioned you.
Tom went home to eat lunch.
They dream of the day when they'll be rolling in money.
I planted roses in the garden.
Are you working tonight?
"It was you who told Tom, not me."
Fear of death is worse than death itself.
Where can I find toothpaste?
I've been in Boston for three years now.
Tom refused to apologize.
Anybody can make a mistake.
You don't need to know that.
I've taught myself to play the guitar.
I wonder what Tom told Mary.
Tom eventually gave up.
We applauded the performer.
We caught a lot of fish this afternoon.
What did that look like?
Which one do you like the most?
"I want to know more about you, Tom."
I'm not as tall as Tom.
Let's get ready.
Tom drives a sports car.
Tom bought everything he needed to buy.
I'm making waffles.
"If you don't know, find out."
I won't buy anything.
You almost gave me a heart attack.
How do you feel?
I've thought a lot about what you said.
"Now, what am I supposed to do?"
Tom wants a puppy.
Everybody here knows your name.
I'm going to do that myself.
You're kidding!
Does Tom always do that?
I'll take care of your kitten while you're away.
Tom already knows what happened.
I don't think Tom has those kinds of problems.
The work is practically finished.
Tom refused to give me my money back.
Tom is indecisive.
Tom and Mary often watch movies together.
I understood.
Did Tom know Mary wouldn't do that?
Tom has more friends than Mary does.
Whoever wants to join our club will be welcome.
No one likes Tom.
The sales in Japan are small in comparison with those in Europe.
I'm dying to see you.
Didn't you know Tom and I were brothers?
Is there a swimming pool near your house?
Tell Tom we're here.
Did anybody take notes?
Tom recommended you for the job.
I had a heart attack.
I don't understand why you're leaving.
Tom doesn't need to go.
Throw the dice.
Tom certainly didn't disappoint the audience.
It seems that something is wrong with this car.
You killed my mother.
I crashed.
Your theory has no scientific basis.
I hope you'll get well soon.
Don't you read the tabloids?
Mary was an actress.
Tom can't work tonight.
Tom enjoyed school.
Can you remove it?
Tom is a pastry chef.
Tom doesn't want to learn how to do that.
I don't think this is the best solution.
I switched off the TV.
I suspect Tom has already left for Boston.
I know who you were with.
Tom would never wait that long.
We haven't yet decided what to do with it.
We're reasonable people.
Who'll take care of your cat then?
I want to go abroad someday.
Tom said he thinks that there's no life on Mars.
Tom is my idol.
We all need love.
A guy named Tom came to see you.
Tom says he doesn't know anybody here.
I told you I don't want your help.
We traveled around Australia.
Here's what you asked for.
I told you this was going to be interesting.
Tom didn't tell me about it.
He is a Hollywood star.
We have just bought two pieces of furniture.
How much candy did you buy?
Tom showed me what he meant.
Your mother is anxious about your health.
Tom won't let you win.
I miss my kids.
I started digging.
Tom and Mary are going to Australia tomorrow.
I don't think that Tom likes to ski.
Tom isn't going to want to do that.
Say goodbye.
What's that smell?
Didn't you know that Tom was going to Boston with Mary?
Tom has a fast car.
I hope things change.
It won't be long before that happens.
None of Tom's children can speak French.
Are you going to vote for Tom Jackson?
He came down with a cold.
The man was branded as a traitor.
How's the water here?
I knew we could do that.
You're always finding fault with me.
This mushroom is not good to eat.
Tom disappeared without a trace.
She missed him a lot.
I can't do as he told me to.
Don't listen to that man.
Tom often asks for my advice.
You have my permission.
That's why so many students are absent today.
The manufacturer guaranteed the new machine for 5 years.
It was stupid of me to make such a mistake.
Something is going on today.
Bring me the scissors.
I just want you to know I don't believe you.
He took a quick look at the magazine.
I'm worried.
Tom has finally found a job.
Row me across the river.
She is an old acquaintance of mine.
I don't think that it's a good decision.
I don't know how to use Facebook.
You should've said yes.
Aren't you worried it might be a trap?
You don't need to know that.
I'm really going to miss Boston.
He is wearing a hat.
You're going to lose.
Tom lost his hair because of the chemotherapy.
Tell Tom to hurry.
Excuse me one second.
We'll be safe here.
I'd be happy to help.
The Greens are against everything.
When can I do that?
"Smile at the camera, please!"
See for yourself.
Are you still in school?
You must think I'm crazy.
Tom told me he lived on Park Street.
I'll never forget what you did for my family.
Do you know all of Tom's children's names?
I was in Canada then.
How much money do we owe you?
You can sit here.
Cleveland was not sure the boy was his son.
I'm not the one who told Tom to do that.
Tom hasn't been told what to do yet.
I don't want Tom to sing.
Didn't I say that?
Who will win the World Cup?
"I wanted to go to Boston, but my father wouldn't let me."
We walked along the beach.
Get me a glass of milk.
How did you come by this painting?
Let me give you some advice.
We used to visit each other on weekends.
Thank you for helping me cross the street.
That's what I hope for.
It's a pity that he can't get married to her.
Thank you for taking care of my dog.
She apologized to him for being late.
Why did you buy a Japanese car?
I think Tom is absolutely right.
Did you hire Tom?
Let's say you're right.
I'm honest.
My father practices medicine.
My car is red.
Do you know why this date is important?
Here's some more tea.
You can ski on that hill.
Were you able to do everything you wanted to do?
I don't think I can eat all this.
I should've been there.
That must be a mistake.
I'll be back at ten.
"I don't mind the cold, but I can't stand the heat."
It'll take us at least three hours to finish this.
I don't pretend to understand women.
We have to be careful.
Tom is leaving Kobe tomorrow morning.
I'm very pleased to hear of your success.
Tom is calling back.
She is proud of her daughter.
I think that it's time for me to change jobs.
We understood each other very well.
Let Tom speak.
I'll likely spend the rest of my life in prison.
Tom leaned back on the couch.
Everything else doesn't matter now.
I know that you play the drums.
I hope we don't have to sell our house.
The baby takes after his mother.
I gave him the book.
I've done my part.
"Tom, there's a policeman here to see you."
Why are you sleeping?
Tom and I both can't swim.
Circumstances have changed.
He was very excited.
Tom can't be older than Mary.
I decided not do that anymore.
Let me see your hands.
That box is bigger than this one.
Life is not all fun.
You could help us.
I totally agree with what you say.
Is Tom there yet?
A few people came to the lecture.
Stop lying to me.
I am like my sister.
He was awfully skinny.
This bride is covering her face with a veil.
Please show this to Tom.
I don't think I need to help Tom do that.
Tom needed some cash.
I remember that day.
Why is God punishing me?
I don't have a cell phone.
Tom is working on that.
The documents appear to have been changed.
Everyone knows that you're lying.
Where is the nearest church?
I'm home for the weekend.
The prince asked the little girl why she was crying.
How much time have you spent in Boston?
What else could it be?
I've seen you somewhere before.
They basked in the sun.
Tom said he didn't want to talk about work.
Tom passed by.
I knew that Tom needed to do that.
Would you mind closing the door?
I do like fish.
Tom doesn't know a lot about music.
I know you're still in love with me.
Tom took off his trousers.
Tom should've told us about that earlier.
All I have is books.
She turned down our offer of help.
I'm ruthless.
Maybe Tom was trying to warn us about something.
Are you trying to be funny?
I thought Tom was a musician.
The lawn needs mowing.
"Without your support, we probably won't be able to put this plan into practice."
Are you doing that on purpose?
"Tom wants children, but Mary doesn't."
How do you know that you don't need a bodyguard?
Where can we go?
"Now that he has gone, we miss him very much."
Is it going to snow tonight?
I'm really proud of you.
Why are you alone?
I had a very good time at Karuizawa.
We'll take this.
I didn't expect Tom to get here so soon.
"Don't go anywhere alone, OK?"
"Is your name Tom? ""No, it's John."""
Tell me which one to choose.
There's nothing more to discuss.
Please move your bicycle out of here.
What difference does that make to you?
You are wrong.
Tom knew what Mary was trying to do.
May I have something to drink?
Tom and Mary are smiling.
I've done the best I could to help you. The rest is up to you.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
Tom is very likely doing that now.
I've got no reason to lie to you.
Look at her putting on airs over there.
Let's not talk about my problems.
Tom forgot my birthday again this year.
Keep an eye on my bag for a while.
Tom is almost always home.
Tom told me that he likes to swim.
Tom told me I should leave.
That's not up to you.
Tom and Mary dated for a long time.
I had my watch stolen yesterday.
These are turbulent times.
No one believed me.
"Next week, I'm taking the plane to Chicago."
Let's wait here till he comes back.
Could you tell me the way?
All the students are present.
I'm not Catholic.
What you said made everyone angry.
Tom asked me if I had a plan.
Is this ethical?
Have you ever asked Tom why he likes doing that?
Tom may not want to go.
"People speak so much about the need for leaving a better planet for our children, and forget the urgency of leaving better children for our planet."
Do you think your money is safe in a bank?
I was convicted.
He is allergic to dust.
Today we can't get anything without money.
How do you intend to do it?
Were you alone all week?
Tom asked Mary to be more careful the next time.
I think that Tom and Mary are Canadians.
We're out of danger.
Tom is very lonely.
The captain is responsible for the safety of passengers.
I probably won't change my mind.
Was that all you wanted to say to me?
Tom is as good a cook as his father.
Watch what everyone does and do the opposite.
I told you to be careful.
I want you to stop following me.
I'm the one who should've gone to Australia.
"Unless you hurry, you will be late for school."
Tom was my neighbor for three years.
Why are you still up?
Is there anything you need?
It's time to decide.
My dream is to become a very strong mahjong player.
I need to warn my mom.
Do you know where I might be able to find Tom?
Can you tell me how to get to the nearest station?
I won't ask you to do that.
Some bus stops have places you can sit.
I'll go find us something to eat.
That's Tom's book.
I'm not sure when Tom will be back.
The butler brought Tom his coffee.
Tom is cruel.
Tom never wins at tic-tac-toe.
Were you the one who told Tom that he shouldn't go?
What were Tom and Mary doing in Boston?
Tom and Mary moved into their new house.
I want to hear more about Tom.
It'll take at least three hours.
I understand that you're angry.
I don't know what was going on.
Tom hadn't noticed Mary.
"Don't do that, please."
I found the story interesting.
I'll notify you and Tom.
It took me three years to write this book.
When do you eat breakfast?
I've never lived in Boston.
I'm glad you asked that.
Tom should go home now.
She let the secret out.
Do you remember your grandfather?
Tom doesn't work here.
Will it hurt a lot?
Tom bought an expensive car.
No one knows her name.
Have you been invited to the reception?
He is one of the candidates running for mayor.
Tom is now Mary's assistant.
Tom became a French teacher.
Tom made the right decision.
Do you want us to stay here?
Here's a little secret.
"Tom wanted to be like his brother, John."
We are all in the same situation.
I jog twice a week.
I'm sick of being sick.
Tom knows he can't win.
Today is not your day.
There are plenty of fish in this river.
I had no idea you knew how to play mahjong.
I am in charge here.
I want to go to school.
I got up earlier than usual.
We did it according to your instructions.
Don't be afraid. It's just me.
"If only I had a map, I could show you the way."
Warn Tom that Mary is looking for him.
We got something for Tom.
I thought you'd never get here.
She always keeps her room clean.
I tried to phone you.
"Tom, what are you doing?"
Tom never talked about you.
Have you been spying on me?
Does she play the piano?
Can you tell us about that?
I would like a word with you.
Would it be OK if I discussed it with my wife?
Tom trusted them.
Maybe I deserve this.
Tom needed you.
"Once upon a time, there lived a beautiful princess."
What were you looking for in the basement?
All the stories are interesting.
Have you seen the trailer?
I saw a fishing boat about a mile off the shore.
She's married to a cousin of mine.
She is always complaining of her husband's small salary.
Is that your girlfriend?
The radio broadcast the news in detail.
They're orphans.
"OK, let's assume you're right."
I ate Tom's sandwich and he ate mine.
You're just like your mother.
I prefer black.
"I have about 5,000 yen."
Why is Tom lonely?
"I wanted to go to Boston with Tom, but he said he didn't want to go with me."
It's all gotten out of control.
Tom is the only survivor.
He's living from hand to mouth.
Do you go to school on foot every day?
I want Tom on my team.
I didn't get paid to do that.
I heard Tom hates Mary.
You should've called me sooner.
I still don't remember why.
Stop talking about that.
I'm going to be late for the meeting.
I've got to finish this.
I never wear white socks.
Maybe I exaggerated.
Tom made me do it.
Does Tom know what you did?
You're a lot like Tom.
Why did Tom need a chainsaw?
I just need a big swimming pool.
There are only three options.
Do you dream in French?
Tom went to Boston by himself.
I wish I could live near your house.
"Even after twelve months, Tom can't accept that it's over between him and Mary."
I love weddings.
Tell me that's a joke.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
"When I was your age, I had a boyfriend."
I haven't done my homework.
Tom told Mary to leave me alone.
I know I'll be arrested.
I don't like to wash dishes.
I won the first prize.
He changed his job.
The United States of America is a democratic country.
Ouch!! I've been stung by a bee!!
He's a southpaw.
There's nothing more I can tell you.
Tom is listening to music in his room.
Walking to work in this heat is a bad idea.
I found out something.
Tom's house is for sale.
I don't study after school.
Tom wanted to be the center of attention.
I discovered the truth.
I thought you said you liked Tom.
Don't touch my bike.
That is an old castle.
All my hope is gone.
Did you know Tom is pretty good at speaking French?
I had nothing else to say.
Do you recognize that woman?
I don't think Tom wants to go to Boston with Mary.
I promise you it won't last long.
The distance is hard to estimate.
Aren't you alone?
Tom and Mary are going to go.
Didn't you know that Tom was going to Australia?
We lost sight of him.
Tom believes that Mary can win.
Get me something to eat.
Where did Tom get this list?
Your mother is very young.
"Tom, I'm hungry."
"What's the matter, Tom? Are you crying?"
Your phone is ringing again.
Did you hear me?
She put the key in her pocket.
Tom's reply surprised Mary.
Tom says he wants to go to Boston.
He only paid ten dollars for that shirt.
I've always wanted a child.
He's deeply attached to her.
We're very skeptical.
You need money.
Tom decided not to go to the party.
I don't think Tom is home on Mondays.
They can't give me what I want.
You're difficult to work with.
Tom wouldn't be happy living with Mary.
Have you ever read any French poems?
I fainted.
Have you heard Tom speaking French?
Tom has already forgotten all about you.
Do you think Tom's story is true?
Why do people kiss?
Isn't it the other way around?
I need to know your intentions.
I leave it up to you.
Her older sister got married last month.
I don't think that I'm ready.
"I don't know how, but you did it."
Tom and Mary were young.
I thought you guys were friends.
White is a popular car color.
Tom didn't have the time.
The soccer player kicked the ball.
The only place Tom has ever wanted to live is Boston.
Tom thinks that he's better than anybody else.
She came back in about thirty minutes.
They'll be next.
Tom folded his clothes and put them in his suitcase.
Who can be sure?
I took my shoes off and threw them out the window.
We'll be back before dark.
What was going on?
I don't need any help at all.
I'll do what I can to help you.
Tomorrow will be a busy day for us both.
Is she Japanese?
I'll do anything for you.
I'll make the room comfortable.
Amazon wants to use drones to deliver packages.
I like your family.
I'll never forgive you as long as I live.
How many floors does that building have?
Tom saw a snake.
I thought it might be you.
Didn't you know Tom had a house in Boston?
I don't know anything about their relationship.
Tom's death was an accident.
You're a good student.
Are you angry at me?
Have you ever been abroad?
I got dizzy.
Tom hasn't read that book yet.
"You don't listen, do you?"
Maybe we'll see each other again tonight.
Tom finally spoke.
We're having so much fun.
Do you have to leave?
I don't listen to music when I'm driving.
We can change that.
"You'll stay here, Tom."
They needed the money.
Can you answer this riddle?
That's the most important thing I've learned from you.
Give me a few.
I think Tom really doesn't know the answer.
That's my husband.
I heard you were getting married.
We won't meet again.
Did you like that?
It's not like that.
Tom mistook me for my younger brother.
Why didn't you write me?
Look at him.
You can't run from the past.
Why does this happen?
We all know you don't drink.
Tom didn't need it.
Do you have proof?
I'm unhurt.
How tall is your brother?
"It won't happen again, I swear."
You don't pay attention.
I hate you with all of my heart.
That's my umbrella.
Do you want to learn to play guitar?
He proposed that we take a small break.
That can be dangerous.
Don't throw out this magazine. I haven't read it yet.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
We made a sand castle.
I might need your help.
What exactly was your relationship with Tom?
Tom rode his bike to the store.
It won't likely snow today.
How many soldiers did you see?
It's hard to say no.
I've had the same problem.
Were you working last night?
It's a time bomb.
It was nice meeting you here.
You look like a little girl in that dress.
Who did your hair?
Aren't you free tomorrow?
Hawks are birds of prey.
It's what I want.
"If Tom doesn't help us, we'll never be able to finish this on time."
I came prepared.
Tom knows I'm homesick.
I waited for Tom.
I hardly ever talk to Tom anymore.
I need to find a new job.
These shelves cannot support so many books.
Tom switched off all the lights.
Tom concluded his speech with a proverb.
You were never home.
Tom is trying to do that.
I thought that you said Tom and Mary were married.
I got Tom to wait.
Tom is a rock and roll star.
We can't wait.
That has already happened.
Who doesn't like that?
Do you realize what this means?
I think she's innocent.
I gave all my money away.
He ruled his kingdom fairly.
Tom sent Mary a long letter.
We heard Tom crying.
That's just not right.
You have lots of time.
Those are too big.
I promised Tom I'd wait.
Tom walked up to the counter and ordered a drink.
That'll buy us a little time.
I don't think Tom knows why Mary was arrested.
You're a beauty.
Tom has three employees.
Tom took off his belt.
That's too hard a problem for me to solve.
It's time for you to start getting ready for school.
They'll be all right.
No one had anything left to say.
I call Boston home.
We all like to ride bikes.
Have you been to London before?
Tom is the boy I told you about the other day.
You're way younger than me.
I'm glad that you came.
Please translate this sentence into Japanese.
Tom said he'd help me find what I need.
Tom is just trying to protect you.
I have a throbbing headache.
I'm sorry I wasn't able to do that for you.
I'd say you're jealous.
Tom said good morning to me.
I've never been in a submarine.
I wasn't told that.
Tom doesn't get paid.
They agreed on a price.
Did you have a chance to apologize to Tom?
I thought you'd never get here.
I just want to ask you a question.
She said goodbye.
He caused me to miss the bus.
I'm impulsive.
What happened to your voice?
I want you to give Tom another chance.
Have you been to see a doctor?
He's in a bad state.
Do you want to wear a kimono?

I can hardly make out what he says.
I would also like to rent a car.
He is a little light for a sumo wrestler.
We need to leave.
I told Tom not to wait.
I never really wanted to learn how to swim.
A virus infected Tom's computer.
She is older and wiser now.
I don't know all of them.
Tom didn't ask for my permission.
"Say it again, please."
Read what's on the label.
I think you've misunderstood.
That's a brilliant idea.
You'd better ask Tom for permission.
Tom and Mary were completely alone.
I lost again.
I can't help Tom with that.
This song is for you.
Did you hear about Tom's promotion?
Do you like dancing?
"There are about seventy hens in the henhouse, but only one rooster."
Is this common?
I know that I didn't do that.
What aren't you telling me?
Tom is a little too old for that.
I think I can take care of myself.
You always exaggerate.
How can you lose?
Her eyes were moist with tears.
I know now Tom wasn't joking.
That's foolish.
Tom says that Mary won't win.
The best thing is to tell the truth.
Tom didn't tell us what had happened to him.
You look better today.
Tom laughed at Mary's accent.
That doctor's experiments have blazed the way for new discoveries.
She needed the money desperately.
I won't budge.
I was awake most of last night.
Tom kissed Mary today.
Tom didn't call.
Don't just stand there. Come over here and help me.
Stock prices fell quickly.
I want to talk to you about tomorrow.
I have to peel the apples.
I would like to drink something.
I'll stand.
You must go.
Tom doesn't have enough money to buy a car.
We need to find out who he is and who he's working for.
We were just talking about that.
You've made your position clear.
Do you really want to go?
We have strict rules.
"I am five feet, two inches tall."
How is your brother?
I must leave you.
"Tom, can you come tomorrow?"
That's my chair.
I don't have time to help you.
Tom walked Mary to the subway station.
I arrived too early.
Can you read what's written on the blackboard?
I have to translate the sentences.
I've just had dinner.
We still don't know what's going to happen next.

Have you ever heard of such a thing?

Tom waited for thirty minutes. Mary waited even longer.
I think you have a fever.
Tom will be out of town until next Monday.
Let's have lunch.
You can't have your cake and eat it too.
Have you been downtown this week?
I should've warned Tom.
Do you think in French?
Put it on the shelf.
How do you know who I am?
You're just the person I've been looking for.
It wasn't easy to convince Tom not to do that.
We're glad you're here.
OK. I agree.

Please come back as soon as possible.
The park was deserted.
We have broken off relations with them.
We can see each other.
Our committee consists of ten members.
I know Tom will change.
What have you been doing all this while?
Tom didn't go to the lake with us.

Why can't you just accept that?

There was no response.
She needs our help.
Can we at least sit down?
Do you have a husband?
It's pretty dark.
This is the most comfortable chair in our house.
We need to hire people we can trust.
We all wished each other luck.
I don't want Tom to see me like this.

I want to know.

You and I both know that's not going to happen.
What do I care?
He criticizes everything.
We're closed on Mondays.

I'm very shy.
Where are your things?
The picnic was called off because of the rain.
They basked in the sun.

Now it's your turn.
Will you dance with me?
Blue looks good on you.
An hour spent in the garden is an hour well spent.
I pointed at Tom.
I do what I'm told to do.
You should have completed it long ago.
"You made that mistake on purpose, didn't you?"
My life would have been completely empty without you.
We have a couple of hours before our flight.
You're being too pessimistic.
Why are you going?
"I'd better go, too."
"Sorry, I forgot."
"If something happens, call me."
I am not the person I used to be.
Tom has been locked up for three years.

What else is important to you?
How do they manage to find time to do that?
I wanted to say thanks.
Back off!
Do you think you'll be happy here?
Do you think I need a haircut?
What time is your appointment?
I knew there had to be a better way.
Tom's weird.
"I thought that Tom would apologize to Mary, but he didn't."

I'm not going to explain that to you now.
Do you think it's my fault?

Tom is a quiet person.
I believed you.
You have only yourself to blame.
Not even I know what I want.
You're the only person that can persuade Tom to do that.

I think I'll be able to solve the problem by myself.
Tom won't buy a new car.
Tom and I didn't wait for Mary.

Do you see what's happening?
There's one question I would like to ask you.
I can do both things at the same time.
Tom is much smarter than I am.
"Look, it's snowing!"
What's your answer?
Did anybody see you there?
I don't think we need permission to do this.
Aren't you in town?
Tom made this mistake intentionally.
Do you believe in monogamy?
It's a dictionary.
It isn't necessary to do that now.
I'm too lazy to do that.
Do you like my friend?
Calm down. We're just a few minutes from the hospital.
I'll have to talk to Tom about it.
Give her this letter when she comes.

The chances are he's already heard the news.
You don't owe Tom anything.
Enjoy your holidays.
Shouldn't you be at work now?
It's your duty.
Tom was throwing rocks at my dog.
The hospital is near here.
What time shall I come?
I have diabetes.
What happened to the rest of the money?
Don't leave me here alone.
Nothing's going to happen tonight.
"I have a bathrobe, but I seldom wear it."
I don't want a divorce.
I like fishing.
I know the answer.
Is the post office open on Sunday?
I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed our time together.
We're not complaining.
Tom was treated like a king.
Accidents happen all the time.
I think you impressed Tom.
We've known each other a long time.
What happened wasn't Tom's fault.
I doubt if anyone has told Tom what to do.
We all felt hungry.
We need money to do that.
I know that Tom might've done that on purpose.
Do you believe in love at the first sight?
I closed my eyes to calm down.
The plane flew over the mountain.
My cat is white.
Are you a ghost?
Tom doesn't know where his passport is.
What time are you planning to meet Tom?
I don't think that she looks like her mother.

Leave a message and I'll call you.
Do you have a calendar?
Who wants that?
I'm totally and completely in love with you.

He is apt to forget.
The fire started in the kitchen.
I really didn't understand.
Who's your friend?
No one's in there.
We're not supposed to do that.
Tom washed his face.
Tell me why you didn't do that.
This is all I have left.
I wish I could help you.
You must do as you are told to do.
We're going to get you out of there.
Tom doesn't like it when Mary criticizes him in public.
"After that, he went home."
That's all I can say at the moment.
Tom didn't know what else to do.
I have seldom seen such a beautiful sunset as this.
Why didn't you tell Tom about that?
Tom's cellphone vibrated on the table.
Do you want to know who helped?
I'm not sure if Tom can speak French.
Why do I need an alibi?
Tom is the best drummer in Boston.
He was intrigued.
One of my favorite songs is Hungry Spider.

Who were you going to sell it to?
Tom will be the winner.
I hope you were a good girl.
"I'm sorry, but I have a prior engagement."
We must work as long as we live.
Can I see you for a sec?
All the buses are full.
I don't even know why.
Tom goes to the library at least once a month.
I was shaking.
Tom didn't go there.
Trans fats are bad for your health.
Our teacher will return from abroad in August.
Europe is not a country.
Are you seriously thinking about not going?
There's no point doing that.
A fork is missing.
How long do you think Tom has been watching us?
Will you take it?
I saw how Tom did it.
Are you looking?
I hid it somewhere.
Tom is a taxi driver.
The doctor told me to avoid certain foods.
I wish I hadn't told anyone.
Don't do something you'll regret.
What does it actually mean?
Does Tom know that I can't do that?
"Action speaks louder than words, but not nearly as often."
Tom said he'd be busy until 2:30.
It was too nice a day to stay inside.
Didn't you know Tom was going to Australia?
Don't even touch it.
You can use mine.
They started it.
The color white is a symbol of purity.
He is what we call a man of culture.
Who did you hear that from?
Tom is very busy today.
I have a surprise for you.
When was the last time you saw Tom smile?
There's a lot of dust in the attic.
Let's go by bus to see more of the city.
I was talking about Tom.
His wife's a friend of mine.
You should get a couple hours of sleep.
"If you have any doubts, let me know without any hesitation."
Tom can do that if he wants to.
It was such a romantic moment.
Tom is going to stop you.
What did you buy today?
You're very angry.
Your smile always makes me happy.
Bagpipes produce a very strange sound.
Are we going far?
I can't remember the last time I saw Tom so happy.
Where can I see a football game?
When will you bring back my umbrella?
When was the last time you had to deal with this kind of problem?

This table isn't steady.
I was just wondering what languages you can speak.
"The treaty was signed on November 18, 1903."
Is Tom still working?
The computer is broken.
Tom doesn't understand Mary.
I don't understand what that means.
I didn't know Tom at all.
I missed you.
Only two people survived the earthquake.
I believed Tom.
I thought that you'd never come here.
You called?
I get up at six.
We must phone the police.
I added water.
The drug problem is international.
It was in the basement.
I'm not mad at anybody.
Cars arrived there one after another.
I knew it was you.
Tom looks very sick.
"One cup of coffee, please."
The dog is barking at Tom.
It's doubtful that Tom will win.
What color is your car?
I should've thought of this before.
I think Tom had a good reason.
Please take a look at that picture.
I was hoping you could give me a hand.
Tom will pay for this.
"If I do that, Tom will laugh at me."
We drank all night.
Tom had his car key in his left hand.
Tom can do that.
You need to tell Tom the truth.
What does Tom do for a living?
My children are adults now.
What are you going to say?
The teacher told me to stand up.
We help each other.
Do you like Tom?
I don't think that Tom has time to talk to you now.
He is anything but a fool.
The president remained in bed.
Most souvenir shops are filled with worthless knick-knacks.
We all have different strengths.
The fruit is similar to an orange in shape and to a pineapple in taste.
Let me say what I think.
She's just the girl next door.
I don't want to go to the pool.
My parents will be proud of me.
I admit that I've been careless.
You don't know anything about me.
Everything we've told you is true.
She gave me a pretty doll.
I'm the one in the middle.
Will you look after the children?
I assume you've heard about what happened here yesterday.
I was almost naked.
Don't show this to Tom.
"Whatever happens, I want you to know that I love you."
He took his defeat hard.
Are you telling me you don't know where Tom lives?
Tom and I kissed again.
Tom's grandfather was illiterate.
Tom just happened to be there at the same time I was.
Spanish is spoken in Central and South America.
How awful!
Tom was just unlucky.
We haven't heard from Tom in a long time.
I thought you were going to talk to Tom about it.
Did you really dream about me?
I have to go home immediately.
I don't think that Tom knows how good a cook Mary is.
Will I see you tonight?
We all looked out the window.
I can't remember the last time I was this happy.
I wish that Tom hadn't seen us doing that.
Meat won't keep long in this heat.
Tom definitely doesn't like Mary.
The basket was empty.
I heard a noise behind me.
Tom is certain to succeed.
Can you spare me a few minutes? I'd like to have a word with you.
Tom's career was over.
"Tom is an interesting person, isn't he?"
We're ready for dinner.
Neither Tom nor Mary went to the concert.
Can you cancel?
You will not be able to catch the train.
The boy has a good school record.
Come home before dark.
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
That's what I'm looking for.
I thought it went well.
I just got back today.
Where is it?
Don't compare yourself to Tom.
What's the good of having a car if you don't drive?
Tom told me to ask you.
Tom demanded an apology.
Is it broken?
Tom promised me that he'd be here.
I wasn't impressed by what I saw.
Do you like Indian food?
I'm still living in Australia.
Can you tell me what day of the week this is?
That is why he got angry.
Tom is lucky that he can swim.
Do you want me to shut the door?
I belong here.
Chicken pox is a common childhood illness.
Tom didn't kiss me.
What have you brought?
He found my bike.
Night is when most people go to bed.
My mom bought this shirt for me.
I'm not used to making speeches in public.
A bicycle will rust if you leave it in the rain.
Can you give me a little bit more time?
I liked your friends.
He had known some of them before the war.
I told Tom to stay indoors.
I know that you're smart.
Be content.
I'm very proud to be part of this project.
She is going to wash the bike this afternoon.
I'm unbiased.
Tom took a cold shower this morning.
She walked twenty miles a day.
I woke up early yesterday.
Tom promised to talk to Mary about that.
I'm tired and I want to go home.
Tom got drunk last night.
Maybe Tom shouldn't eat that.
I did that because I had to.
We have to speak.
Please keep the door closed.
Tom never stops.
Let's sit here on this bench.
Can I buy you a drink?
Tom tried to squeeze into the jeans he had worn when he was a teenager.
Get everybody downstairs.
I have a cold sore on my lip.
I'm the one who usually does that.
I like what you've done with this place.
I can teach you how to do that.
Are they going to beat me up?
This is terrible.
I liked that wine.
It was a most difficult problem.
My hobby is playing the guitar.
I don't know the password.
Did Tom think that I was in Australia?
Somebody is watching you.
Everyone makes that mistake.
My grandmother ran off with a cowboy.
We knew what to expect.
Didn't you know that Tom was married?
Don't say I didn't warn.
I can't believe you're enjoying this.
What girl are you talking about?
Three people have died.
Let me teach you how to do that.
I got up earlier than usual.
What was your opponent's name?
I didn't know that Tom would be there.
Tom wasn't wearing a tuxedo.
Tom brushed Mary's hair.
Help us.
Do you live alone?
Tom and Mary must be worried.
What exactly did you see?
I didn't want to spend any more time working on that project.
I'm just a regular office worker.
I'm not an expert in this field.
Please promise me you won't do that.
Do you believe it now?
Are you working on anything interesting?
My grandmother always said it was a sin to waste food.
"How do you say ""good bye"" in German?"
Tom pretended he didn't understand French.
Tom promised us his support.
Let Tom sleep.
Doctors do not always live long.
I've worn out two pairs of shoes this year.
Didn't you know I was from Australia?
Life is never easy.
Let's not talk about school.
I hope that you like it.
I'm correcting my mistakes.
The same thing happened in Boston.
Have you seen this?
Tom doesn't remember where he put his keys.
Are we really going to do this every Monday?
I'm not a farmer.
Did you remember to pack your toothbrush?
That building is three stories high.
I knew what I was doing.
I didn't have a plan.
My throat hurts when I swallow.
What's Tom listening to?
Tom thought that the worst was over.
Tom waters his lawn every day.
I left my umbrella in the car.
Why are you calling me?
I'm going to wash the dishes.
Mary divorced her husband and married Tom.
I need you to do that right away.
Tom has been found guilty.
I'm glad you're okay.
I think we all know the rules.
I haven't the faintest idea what you mean.
Don't get me wrong.
They missed Tom.
Go back to your work.
It's a good plan.
Tom has never swum in our pool.
Your suggestion seems reasonable.
I'll be back in just a second.
Please let me go.
He himself did it.
Tom and Mary look worried.
Help me and I will help you.
I've drawn a map.
I can't do that without your help.
We really miss Tom.
Tom was wearing a sweater.
I know that Tom is a lot like his older brother.
You're very imaginative.
She was advised by him not to borrow money from his friends.
Tom isn't going to have to do that.
Tom taught me how to make pancakes.
You'll have to ask Tom.
Tom has been waiting patiently in the lobby for three hours.
You look very sleepy.
Tom told me it might take a while.
Tom took my keys.
"Democracy is the worst form of government, except all the others that have been tried."
The school year is almost over.
I agree totally.
I wasn't even driving that fast.
I don't want either of them.
We want to change that.
Tom thinks that Mary should apologize to John.
It's starting to rain.
Tom plans to study French.
Tom needs that money.
I told Tom not to do this.
I'll do anything that Tom asks.
Where exactly did you see Tom?
I have complete confidence in you.
Let's wait.
Call us.
Please call Tom.
I wasn't the one who gave Tom Mary's phone number.
I couldn't help crying.
Open fire!
Stay out of Tom's way.
"According to the weather forecast, a storm's coming."
Who are you with?
Tom couldn't make a living as a musician.
Tom is a neurologist.
Did you love Tom?
We're not ready to throw in the towel.
All was still.
I don't know who started the rumor.
"By the way, where were you last night?"
We'll go after we eat.
Mary can speak Japanese.
"I used to think that only bears hibernate, but the teacher said that turtles do as well."
We're curious.
I asked Tom some questions.
It won't be easy persuading Tom to go.
Tom hasn't fried the fish yet.
"He cannot walk, let alone run."
You're in my hands.
Will she come?
You've misunderstood.
Tom suggested that we leave right away before it started to rain.
It's not my place to question Tom's loyalty.
Tell everybody.
I'm not in the mood to do that now.
I don't have the strength to keep trying.
I was going to call Tom.
"I'm looking for Tom. You don't know where he is, do you?"
"You know what Tom is capable of, don't you?"
Open the drapes.
I can't explain the reason for his conduct.
You didn't mention that.
We have to make do with what we've got.
I always keep promises.
Do you have my money?
I got to know him.
Don't let the grass grow under your feet.
No one is talking.
His death was a great loss to our country.
I'd like to sing a song.
I kept this for you.
I don't want to be distracted.
I thought you already had one.
My heart is broken.
Tom said that he had eaten lunch with his friends.
How many men named Tom do you know?
"I couldn't see Tom's face, but I was sure he was smiling."
What do we have here?
Tom uncorked the wine.
I've been trying to contact you all week.
"I'm sorry, I can't help you."
You have visitors.
"Cats can climb trees, but dogs can't."
It's safer there.
"It wasn't exactly what I wanted, but I bought it anyway."
I thought that you and Tom were friends.
You haven't done anything wrong.
Is it clear now?
Tom leaned over the table and kissed Mary.
Tom requested that we take care of his child.
I don't know anybody smarter than Tom.
My right foot is sleeping.
Tom is Mary's business partner.
I've never been a teacher.
Why did you start learning French?
I just finished painting the house.
Tom is loved by everyone.
I've had a lot of calls today.
I'm going to make you an offer that you can't refuse.
Father asked me to open the door.
I have missed you so much.
I forgot to tell you about Tom.
What makes you think Tom would ever consider going on a date with Mary?
We know you're very rich.
Tom had a near death experience last summer.
I didn't even think about it.
Congratulations on your anniversary.
She can't afford it.
Let's start with the simple questions.
I thought it was true.
You need a new one.
Let's slow down.
It would take at least three hours to do that.
Have you written your report?
This is not for me.
I know when to quit.
I hope that Tom can wait for us.
I wish I knew what to tell Tom.
Tom knows the drill.
I knew you'd ask about that.
You can't come in here.
You're the only one here who can speak French.
You are very rich.
"Every time something bad happens, I get blamed."
Tom didn't have the courage to admit his mistake.
Tom doesn't know much about music.
We can give it a try.
You could've ruined everything.
Tom broke his back.
You can watch television after dinner.
What'll you buy?
I didn't know who else to ask.
Has the situation improved?
Would you like to take a look at it?
The yen is rising and the dollar is falling.
The police think Tom murdered his parents.
I'm paralyzed.
Tom figured out how to solve the problem.
We need more people like you.
Tom is the only guy I know from Boston.
I agree with some of what you said.
Did you really eat everything?
Tom isn't a vegetarian.
Tom cut himself while he was shaving.
Have I ever lied to you?
Did you find your key?
Show me another camera.
I won't bother you.
They played table tennis together.
It's cold in here.
Why don't you just do it?
Tom will assist us.
He was charged with assault and battery.
You're the same age as my son.
When do you usually eat lunch?
You're famous.
It's been a while since I've done that.
What have you heard?
Tom was always busy.
Tom did that intentionally.
I haven't downloaded the files yet.
You play the guitar very well.
Life is not all fun.
Bring Tom over.
How many rooms do you have?
"For further information, see page 16."
The toilet is over there.
I enjoy watching children play.
Did someone say something?
I was going to go.
Stay in this room.
How much does a soccer ball weigh?
Tom was the only other person who had to do that.
Tom was the last person to get off the bus.
Look what we've done.
I spend a lot of time practicing the guitar.
I thought you were in Boston.
"You hired Tom, didn't you?"
I wanted Tom to clean his room.
I waited for more than three hours.
I don't like to be ignored.
A compromise was reached.
It rained.
What did you want to talk to Tom about?
Can I play with you?
Tom doesn't want Mary to go anywhere without him.
Tom had a hat on.
There is no food.
Tom lied to the police.
You won't need an umbrella today.
Why not?
Tom told Mary that he'd do that.
Tom has a sister in Boston.
The elevator is out of order.
"Compared to Tokyo, London is small."
I got the job I wanted.
I am tired of the work.
Don't open this box.
After you.
I told you not to come here.
Consider my request.
Tom thought Mary was still outside.
Tom's dog died last week.
No one knows why.
I won't go to Boston with Tom.
Do you know why Tom left Boston?
Everybody stayed in Australia except Tom.
I've only been here three months.
Tom never touched me.
I'd like to know why you weren't here yesterday.
I'll ask Tom to cook something for us.
"I didn't want to become a doctor, but my parents wanted me to become a doctor."
It smells delicious.
I'm very glad about that.
Why are you visiting us?
I can't believe Tom is still talking about what happened two years ago.
I had a weird dream.
Who ate the last cookie?
Please finish the work at once.
He's almost always in the hospital.
You shouldn't have called me.
I didn't want to admit that I was the one who broke the window.
We have to do that today.
My school marks were average.
This statue is as large as life.
"I tried, but I couldn't do it."
I lost my glasses.
I live on the fifth floor.
You won't believe what I found today.
Tom broke his leg.
It fits perfectly.
The sun gives us heat and light.
I knew Tom wouldn't be able to get the box open.
Tom died of rabies after having been bitten by a bat.
Were you married at that time?
The plane landed on my dad's farm.
"You still don't believe me, do you?"
Tom bought a leather jacket.
"Tom doesn't know what happened, does he?"
"I used to drink a lot of cola, but now I drink only water."
I want to go with you tonight.
Tom didn't know where he should go.
We're waiting for you.
Try to get some rest.
Mother is more anxious about the result of the examination than I am.
Tom helped me pack my suitcase.
You understand me.
Let's start with beer.
It's Tom's.
My room is three times as large as yours.
You're the right man for this job.
We watched an interesting movie.
Tom died a few days ago.
Tom is somewhere in Boston.
I want you to know that I'll always love you.
Asians generally have black hair.
Someone is inside.
Tom didn't ask Mary who she was planning to go to Australia with.
Are you still at the office?
I consider myself fortunate.
I'm in town on business.
Hold the rope tight.
We're never going to find out who did that.
We shouldn't laugh at Tom.
Tom goes to bed at ten o'clock.
Tom has short hair.
You obviously want to help.
Tom raised his glass.
I'm teaching Tom French.
Tom loves playing Irish tunes on the fiddle.
Her father died.
What have you done with your car?
Tom couldn't decide what book to read.
Can't we start again?
Keep this.
It's very nice of you.
I have not more than three thousand yen.
There's too much sugar in the coffee.
It took me three years to build my house.
I used to like that.
Tom got stuck with the whole bill when he went out drinking with Mary and her friends.
Are you sure that it was Tom who did that?
Tom hasn't bought his ticket yet.
Tom didn't even ask me about it.
I didn't know whether I needed do that or not.
This is the largest.
I put on my shoes at once.
I tried to stand up.
That's absurd.
"Well, I really must go."
I've got to make some calls.
I knew you wouldn't win.
It's hard to throw things out.
I can't bear to see her cry.
What do you want for dessert?
He gave me a present.
It's very old.
I must think it over before answering you.
We should ask Tom.
Tom doesn't need to thank me.
This one's for you.
She owns a very big house.
Tom doesn't have to explain anything.
I'm motivated.
My mother is sick.
We have to stop.
I thought you hated me.
Tom does that a lot better than me.
It's now time for you to go home.
I can't think about anything else.
How much did you pay for that suit?
There are too many people in the park.
"Which did you eat, fish or meat?"
Tom saw Mary eating a sandwich.
Tom shouted at the top of his lungs.
Tom enjoys cooking.
There were few students left in the classroom.
Which is the best way to travel?
Tom was asking for help.
We both pretended nothing had happened.
Tom is hitting Mary.
Is that what Tom wants?
Tom always wears shades.
I don't know what Tom knows.
The bus drivers here are terrible.
I don't think that I have the time to help you today.
It's not a gift.
Tom is well aware of what is going on at the office.
Tom said he would come to the party.
He is always complaining about his boss.
Tom continued digging.
I know that you're learning French at school.
I didn't finish reading that book.
Tom became a drug addict.
She embroidered her initials on a white handkerchief.
"Hold your tongue, Tom."
Did you get what you wanted?
The sun rises early in the morning.
"If it rains the day after tomorrow, I'll stay at home."
I have a wife back home in Boston.
I hope to see you the next time you are in Tokyo.
Tom didn't come back.
A baseball came flying through the window.
Tom found Mary fascinating.
Tom doesn't know any of us.
Tell them to keep quiet.
I don't think anybody's going to help you.
Could you tell us what happened next?
Tom hummed a tune to himself as he did the washing up.
He speaks English.
I've had enough of you.
She is living in the middle of nowhere.
Who gave you this envelope?
I knew you wouldn't want to do that.
The doctors are looking at an x-ray.
They collect our garbage every Monday.
Tom is looking for an easy way to lose weight.
Mary is young and beautiful.
I thought you might help.
That was yours.
Tom doesn't want this either.
We only need one.
Tom doesn't like not being able to control Mary.
I don't want Tom making the same mistakes I made.
It may rain.
Catch you later.
Those were the days.
I saw you on television.
"No one is born wise, but many die stupid."
Who is that?
I'll understand if you say no.
He seems to be honest.
It will be dark by the time he gets there.
Do you know whether or not Tom will be at the meeting?
I'm not famous.
They only wanted to ask me a few questions.
I got up earlier than usual in order to catch the first train.
Maybe we should buy a new one.
I'll save you a seat.
Show us where you found it.
"By the time Tom realized what was happening, it was too late."
How many pieces of baggage do you have?
I think Tom did that intentionally.
They're getting worse.
We've had a good time.
When did you come in?
I consider you my friend.
Tom is too young to drive.
This isn't witchcraft.
I can't believe you turned down that job.
I told Tom not to go into the cave.
You're not responsible for what Tom did.
Have you been working here long?
Tom doesn't want dinner.
I'll clean that up.
Do you understand sign language?
I hope that you weren't disappointed.
The show is just starting.
I have no idea what to do now.
Were you here this morning?
He told me an interesting story.
Check your pockets.
"My idea is better, I think."
I wanted to apologize to Tom.
It's up to you to decide what to do.
I need a quiet place to think.
Here we are.
Tell her that I am just joking.
Tom is a much better singer than me.
It's a great idea.
Everyone knows Tom.
Please don't let this happen again.
This shop belongs to me.
I still can't remember where I put my passport.
I've been very busy this week.
Did he show you the picture?
Tom could be seriously injured.
He is taller than his brother.
I know you're frustrated.
Tom stayed at a hotel.
My nose is too big.
"Don't flirt with me, Tom."
Don't be so crass.
I had no idea you were a teacher.
No one was quite sure.
It looks like it's going to rain tomorrow.
I don't need a ride.
That's just what I needed.
Mary has been dyeing her hair for years.
I can't live with it.
We didn't create it.
Don't be such a pessimist.
I only told you and Tom.
I’ll introduce you to my mother.
I knew Tom wouldn't be busy.
Could you give me a ball-park figure?
"Can you answer the question, please?"
Tom wants to know why Mary didn't go to school today.
When did you tell Tom?
Who invited you to the party?
A noun can be singular or plural.
"You were a waiter, weren't you?"
We waited for you.
Drive on.
We have ants in the kitchen.
I have no idea. That's why I'm asking.
You can take the bus to the station.
I'm not sure this is necessary.
Tom was convinced that Mary would do that.
I think I'm ready for a change.
You have to go to the meeting.
I don't like the ocean.
Tom isn't as sure about this as Mary is.
You've been really helpful.
I failed the test.
Tom was covered in bruises.
Am I the only one that agrees with you?
What are they going to find?
Some people eat sushi with their hands.
We're both students.
The cat didn't move a muscle.
How can we stop Tom?
What have you done with your car?
Showing your real feelings is not considered a virtue in Japan.
I think what you did was a mistake.
Tom prefers his clothes to be loose-fitting.
I was unconscious.
You must act according to your principles.
Can you give this to Tom?
We know what you're capable of.
There are many people who don't like me.
The police arrested a suspect yesterday.
I'll be away till Christmas.
It was hard to resist the impulse to wring Tom's neck.
Tom and Mary seemed to get along.
Tom tried to help.
Tom doesn't usually do things like that.
Tom didn't mention Mary at all.
He shook hands with her and smiled.
I promise you that I'll never do that again.
Tom's imaginative.
Tom didn't want to play chess with me.
I can't explain it now.
Don't blame others for your failure.
Tom told me he wouldn't be able to do that.
They have black hair.
"It had the head of a woman, the body of a lion, the wings of a bird, and the tail of a serpent."
Tom never forgave me.
I had to bite my lip to prevent myself from laughing.
I can't decide which to choose.
You should watch out for Tom.
I won't stop loving Tom.
Do you have any other questions you want to ask me?
Would you like to go with us?
He is on another line.
Mr. Jackson is our French teacher.
Something was going on.
I'll be ready in a few minutes.
Do you know his name?
Tom scolded his son for being lazy.
Not everyone's like you.
What makes you think Tom won't like it?
The sky will soon clear up.
Tom gave me a ride to school.
Tom always becomes very talkative when he's drinking.
Tom said he didn't like doing that.
Tom won't let us go.
Everybody knew Tom was dying.
I love you more than you love me.
Tom will go skiing next weekend.
May I put it down here?
Tom can wait here.
Who do you think they are?
Can you count to ten?
He is still standing.
"At that point, anything could've happened."
Will I see you tonight?
I know why Tom is here.
Do you have a boyfriend?
Let me guess.
Outline Boston on this map with a red pencil.
This is great.
I bet Tom could help.
We're grateful to you for what you did.
Don't be so lazy.
I thought Tom wasn't afraid.
Those aren't my sunglasses.
Why are you in such a hurry?
Don't you agree with me?
They'll become teachers.
I like the ocean.
This is Tom's house.
It looks like Tom has fallen back to sleep.
I'd like to buy this computer.
Do you plan to go to Tokyo by bus?
I know we can't do that.
I can't bear to see animals suffering.
I cooked dinner for you.
Have you filled the bathtub?
Who sent you?
Tom began running.
Tom wasn't very worried.
Fold up the map.
A number of traffic accidents have happened recently.
I came in through the window.
She's a very good teacher.
Tom is convinced everybody hates him.
Are you referring to me?
Tom believed in Mary's innocence.
I'm bored and don't know what to do.
"Now, why would that happen?"
Tom doesn't often speak French.
"Tom wasn't at home, was he?"
"I know him by sight, but I have never actually spoken to him."
You need to stop.
Did you agree to do that?
Replace it.
Tom told me that he had no enemies.
I hope you get a chance to go to Boston.
Who told the story to you?
Didn't you know I used to do that?
That reminds me of home.
I want you to tell me everything.
Are you trying to insult me?
I'm happy enough.
"It was cold yesterday, wasn't it?"
It'll be winter before long.
A heavy rain fell.
I apologize again.
They exchanged a look.
"According to the newspaper, there was a big fire last night."
I always enjoy hearing you sing.
Stop joking. It's a serious matter.
I didn't plan on staying.
I'm getting older.
I take a bath almost every day.
My dad is accustomed to jogging at night.
Tom advised Mary not to do that.
I don't think that it was a mistake.
Be kind to others.
I can't take my eyes off her.
I'm very grateful to you.
Don't thank me. Thank Tom.
I shouldn't have let you drive.
Can you drive me home?
Tom squatted down.
Please come at once.
I hope all of them will come in time.
I'm glad you're safe.
What exactly are you looking for?
He is also returning late today.
Tom brought me a present.
Tom took everything too seriously.
She and I are classmates.
Everybody hates me.
They formed a new government.
Tom likes making paper airplanes.
The dog is dead.
I think we owe Tom an apology.
I looked at the floor.
You said the same thing about Tom.
Do you want a seat by the window?
Tom knew that Mary was dead.
Tom is a very clever boy.
I've tried them all.
Tom told everyone he wanted to become a barber.
Will you come with me to the store?
He lives on this street.
I wasn't able to answer Tom's question.
I don't think Tom would hire a private detective.
I arrived too early.
What time do you usually have breakfast?
We've had very fruitful discussions.
Tell Tom not to come.
I think it scared Tom.
Tom told me that Mary wasn't upset.
Tom asked me who the girl with red hair was.
Tom will likely be present.
There's a book here.
That's my own personal opinion.
You're too young to go there alone.
This is an active volcano.
Tom ignored everyone's warnings.
Come as soon as possible.
You can always count on Tom.
Prisons aren't enough.
The system is outdated.
Are you spying on me?
Tom didn't even touch Mary.
I've always known that.
What did they hit you with?
I want to be paid in cash.
Tom says that he doesn't remember that at all.
We all know it.
Tom was smart enough to escape.
We all live on planet Earth.
Tom is just not used to doing that yet.
Go get it.
I'm going to rewrite this report.
How do you like your new class?
I can't believe you remember that.
I'm a little bit jealous.
I didn't know many people at the party.
Tom can't help thinking about Mary.
Tom told me that Mary was safe.
Tom hasn't done it yet.
I don't owe anyone anything.
I don't like to be kept waiting.
You'd better not plan on it.
I hope you have a lot of time.
You're mean.
Why don't you do that by yourself?
What do they want you to do?
Tom always says the best way to ruin a good cup of coffee is to put cream and sugar in it.
Tom found a job as a gardener.
Tom is too polite to say no.
"She can ride a motorcycle, not to mention a bicycle."
We bought a car.
Who wants more coffee?
He didn't study at all.
Didn't you know Tom was younger than Mary?
Tom couldn't put his socks on.
I think it's time for me to abandon that plan.
What didn't I tell you?
Tom also had a sister.
We invited him to our house.
What do our guests want?
Tom said that he wouldn't help anyone.
How often do you call your parents?
Will you be in Boston this weekend?
What type of person are you?
There's a place for us.
Tom didn't kill Mary.
I just got a call from Tom.
This flower is more beautiful than that one.
Tom has large hands.
I was in a better mood three hours ago.
I have to do it.
Can you trust Tom?
Tom and John must be brothers.
The boat passed under the bridge.
I've only heard good things about him.
Does it still hurt?
I didn't expect you.
It's strange Tom hasn't come yet.
He had an accident and fractured his leg.
Tom wanted to become an opera singer.
I finished first.
Tom slammed on the brakes.
I wish I were different.
Leave it to me.
"How are you and your wife doing, now that the birds have all flown the coop?"
I don't think I should do that.
It's all I need.
We'll be OK.
I had to make a list of things to buy.
The teacher aroused our interest.
We're better than they are.
I'd like to know more about Boston.
She accused him of stealing her car.
What's the matter with you? You look pale.
I can't let you go alone.
I was weak.
I didn't know that you were hungry.
Who did you have lunch with?
I'm supposed to be working this afternoon.
Do you have a fever?
Here are your keys.
"He saw it, too."
Tom is a famous chef.
"She advised him to take a long holiday, so he immediately quit work and took a trip around the world."
We won't know until we try.
It was not until yesterday that I knew his name.
The ages of the two children put together was equivalent to that of their father.
Tom is a gifted composer.
We moved to Boston three years ago.
How old is your younger son?
Tom is the one who gave this to me.
I don't think Tom has any idea where Mary is now.
Tom asked me if I was happy.
I took a picture.
God created the earth in six days.
Tom is on the beach.
Can you understand the meaning of this sentence?
Would you like to try it?
Tom never went to Boston.
One and one makes two.
"If I had enough money, I could do that."
How many floors does this building have?
Tom must be a Canadian.
Does this hurt?
I'd like to be alone if you don't mind.
I forgot to ask Tom about that.
There's no more room here.
I have my own TV show.
You will eat.
I had never eaten sushi before.
Are you a member of this crew?
What were you doing before this?
I have a simple solution.
I'm waiting for your answer.
Don't you understand that?
When did you read this book?
He got the job.
Tom bumped into Mary.
What would I wear?
I'd leave at 2:30 if I were you.
The earth's moon is a natural satellite.
What are you apologizing for?
No one wants to go there.
Tom quite often gets sick.
That's the man I mean.
Tom didn't know that.
I'll lock the doors.
You could've asked me.
Tom told me how to get to the theater.
I want to know who helped you do your homework.
Who did you give that to?
"My name is Mary and this is my husband, Tom."
I wonder whose footprints these are.
Ask Tom to clear away the dishes.
I thought he wouldn't come.
I agreed to go to Australia with Tom.
You don't need us.
I never would've asked Tom to do that.
She was washing the dishes then.
Tom thought that you'd win.
We saw you on TV.
I have got to go now.
They say that love is blind.
Tom stopped abruptly.
To err is human.
It's not something anyone can do.
I have to at least try.
Who started the fight?
What are you working on?
I asked Tom what he was listening to and he surprised me by saying that he was listening to classical music.
I'm back in Boston.
Put your hands in the air.
Tom didn't want to teach French.
The only question is who.
Production at this factory has increased by 20%.
I can't prove it.
I explained it to Tom.
Tom saw him.
My father is proud of being tall and handsome.
Wait for me outside.
I'm happy with it.
I knew you were going to do that.
I milked the cow.
I was warned.
It was very painful.
I like to do that in the summer.
My mother loves me.
I almost forgot to tell Tom about tomorrow's meeting.
Have you ever felt dizzy on a plane?
We still have an old tube television.
Tom is at home with his wife.
I'm very glad to see you again.
Tom was aware of the difficulties.
Tom called around 2:30.
I will have finished the work by noon.
"You're not here, so I'm really sad."
Tom is so rude.
She broke my heart.
Tom won't help us today.
Everything I told you is the truth.
Is that what Tom told you?
Did you do that on Monday?
He went to Brazil and stayed there.
I won't be able to finish if you don't help me.
Send it airmail.
His supporters were afraid.
Mary isn't as pretty as her sister.
Did you forget something?
They stayed at a very expensive hotel.
I ran for my life.
Tom is fixing the car.
I think I can handle it.
I didn't mean to disturb you.
Tom was proud to be a soldier.
No one knows for sure.
Maybe I should help Tom.
I think you ought to leave.
You're either very brave or very stupid.
Tom was a coach.
Where is a hospital?
I swim once or twice a week.
Don't get married.
I think I left my keys on the kitchen table.
Tom is schizophrenic.
I have lost my pen.
What're you doing with my car?
They're leaving us.
I'm the only one you can trust.
My hair is long.
I don't want to be a disappointment to my parents.
Tom won't be able to do that.
I'll know in three months.
I've given up on the idea of buying a house.
Desperate men do desperate things.
I never meant for Tom to get in trouble.
Wait for us here.
Do you know any foreigners living in your country?
He talks as if he were rich.
Can I ask you for a favor?
I found listening to him very interesting.
I'm not going to ask Tom that question.
Did you behave today?
I'd like to extend my stay through Sunday.
When did your baby start talking?
He is always joking.
Did you know Tom?
That's not a solution.
He fell in love with the girl at first sight.
Tom doesn't have to say anything.
Isn't that enough for you?
The book is red.
Tom and I were laughing at you.
I paid 30 dollars for that.
Please let us know.
This won't end well.
We were worried about Tom.
You're nervous.
I didn't earn this.
Why do you hate Boston so much?
You have three cats.
I was the one who started this.
Tom said he didn't see anybody else.
Tom knows everybody.
This was not the deal.
I said it wasn't a very good idea.
"Whatever you say about me, say it to my face, not behind my back."
Nobody visited me today.
I'll drive Tom home.
Why does Tom want to find us?
You've got to do something.
Tom thought that you'd prefer a blue one.
Tom wanted to be first.
Can I have some milk and cookies?
Tom threw a rotten egg at Mary.
They have many friends.
Don't you want to go out?
Could you speak to Tom?
Tom and Mary were smiling at each other.
"I've been to Australia, but only once."
I'm watching Tom.
I'm going to finish what I started.
Tell Tom he has to get up.
There are survivors.
Tickets are more expensive this year.
I want to sing.
I've come to talk with you.
This picture fascinates me.
Tom flew to Boston last Monday.
Get it away from me.
Tom went back upstairs.
Tom really doesn't want to tell Mary where he was.
The roses were from Tom.
I'm angry.
This room is used for various purposes.
I need a vacation!
Can you give me some advice?
When did you quit smoking?
I know you don't like me.
The black umbrella is Tom's.
He is not married.
What newspaper do you subscribe to?
I am just going for a walk.
Visit us tomorrow.
I want to visit the ruins of Machu Picchu.
Do you want some coffee?
"You're angry, aren't you?"
Tom gave the baby a bath.
I thought that you knew that.
Don't get angry with Tom.
Only fools take risks.
Tom didn't fire Mary.
You'd better call Tom.
Tom can never remember how to spell my name.
I had no idea.
Tom didn't know Mary was going to do that today.
I'll stay here until you return.
Don't ever do that to me again.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
The French language is rich in synonyms.
I heard a sound.
I'm very proud of my father.
Everyone felt it.
I don't know whether you're happy or not.
Tom had better hurry or he'll miss the bus.
I can barely walk.
I'll ask Tom if he needs any help.
I want you to come to my wedding.
She looked after the child.
Who could refuse?
We had a little argument.
I thought you'd come today.
My father practices medicine.
We can't just leave Tom here alone.
Which one of us do you like best?
Try another one.
Tom is the captain of the team.
I'm a stamp collector.
Do you think Tom is still awake?
That's strange.
I think Tom said that.
The box is made of wood.
This one's mine.
Everyone called me Tom.
Tom has a secret admirer.
Do you remember where Tom lives?
I can help you with this.
He showed me how to use this camera.
Tom left his dog at home.
Mary was impressed with what she saw.
I know what I'm doing.
Tom wasn't the one who convinced Mary to do that.
Who's your favorite actor?
We'll meet you downstairs.
It'll be wonderful.
Go away. I want to be alone.
Tom handed Mary the message.
I'm not sure I understand what you mean.
I'm feeling better.
I don't watch that program anymore.
Tom wants us to hang the TV on the wall.
I was relaxed.
Birds fly in the sky.
I took the elevator to the fourth floor.
Apples were served as the dessert.
He has come from Boston.
I miss Boston so much.
We smell with our noses.
Tom said he'd help.
Tom doesn't like being called that.
I put it in the drawer.
What are the possible side effects?
Who do you know there?
Maybe Tom was home.
What's it like outside?
Tom didn't accept my apologies.
I can't concentrate on my work because of the noise.
Do you like IKEA furniture?
I don't need to convince Tom.
Tom and Mary have to buy some things.
I felt powerless.
The scenery was breathtaking.
Tom is a leader.
You said you didn't want me to do that.
I didn't know what size to get.
I forgot to show you how to do that.
It's too late now.
Tom has a lot of homework to do.
I fell asleep on the train.
Tom will never win.
You're welcome to stay here.
That dress is cheap.
Please don't be afraid.
"You have a guilty conscience, don't you?"
It doesn't concern you.
How's your knee?
He's waiting for you at home.
You answer us first.
Don't leave us.
Tom told Mary what he needs to do.
Tom goes to kindergarten.
Please ask me anything.
Living in the town is quite different from living in the country.
Tom was surprised and a little confused.
Keep listening.
Tom can speak French as well as you can.
Tom hates his job for a lot of reasons.
I don't know what we can do about that.
I live in the middle of nowhere.
You'll never understand.
I can't hide you forever.
I'm sure the police will catch the robber eventually.
Tom has bad breath.
I'm glad that wasn't me.
Introduce me to your friend.
It is hard for me to believe this.
It was his first job.
Tom couldn't think of a good place to hide it.
It seems to me that he likes music.
The clock has stopped. A new battery is needed.
I find her appearance attractive.
Was it an explosion?
I'd prefer not to speak French.
Tom was in the shower.
It would take forever for me to explain everything.
What don't you understand?
No one has the right to tell me how I can spend my own money.
Tom always loses his umbrellas.
You're a terrible dancer.
I know you hired an accountant.
That's much worse.
I enjoy talking with you.
Tom yanked the plug from the wall.
You don't look that good.
My wallet has been stolen.
She didn't go because her boyfriend didn't.
Tom was told to leave.
Why didn't you tell me that before?
I suspect Tom would do the same.
It would cost twice as much as that.
I'll take care of the matter personally.
Is distilled water drinkable?
"Will you go, too?"
It shouldn't take me long to do that.
Don't ask me to dance again.
I think I could do that if you helped me.
I was wrong to do it.
We want to hire someone who can speak French.
Tell me you're not serious.
He devoted himself to the study of medicine.
It was like something out of a movie.
I can't think of any other plan.
You should eat something.
The children are playing in the garden.
Tom doesn't have to go to school today.
Tom treated me badly.
Tom doesn't know Mary.
Were there any problems?
We're grateful for your assistance.
I spent three years in Boston.
It's time for you to wake up.
I wish I could figure out how to make Tom happy.
I'll give up smoking.
"Going to the little girl's room is an euphemistic expression for ""going to the toilet."""
Tom earns more than a million dollars a year.
Tom got stopped by the police.
I'm sure Tom hasn't forgotten about us.
Tom often goes fishing.
I went to Boston on business.
Glass is made from sand.
I knew I was going to be punished.
I kept talking to Tom.
I'll have a conversation with Tom.
I wrote the note.
Few people know how to do it.
There seems no doubt about it.
Tom isn't on duty now.
Tom knows who did it.
I'm not going to tell you my name.
There are three possibilities.
I studied the structure of Ainu families.
It was horrible.
I was so hungry.
Tom behaved badly.
Please tell me how to get to Boston.
Please tell us the truth.
He realized his dream of becoming an artist.
We won't allow this to happen.
I have a new car.
I don't think that it's safe to swim here.
You shouldn't miss the opportunity to see it.
I did what you told me to do.
Who do you trust?
There's not much I can do for you now.
Is this legal?
Tom is a diamond in the rough.
It's difficult to understand why you want to go.
When was the last time you had a headache?
How dare you laugh at me!
I am in deep water.
I'm glad you decided to come.
"Do you work there, too?"
I still sometimes cry.
What do you usually do after dinner?
Couldn't you do that for me?
I doubt that she loves you.
I may win.
When should I feed the dog?
Someone has to do that.
I wanted to dance with you.
Who do you think wrote this note?
What is it you do?
She ironed her shirt.
Tom was wet.
You'll do as you're ordered.
Tom is too young to drink.
Stop whimpering.
"Tom is in his room, getting changed."
Tom has been crying a lot lately.
When can you come to my home?
Put yourself in my place.
I'm playing with my cat.
I apologized to Tom.
What do you want me to wear?
Rent is expensive here.
How could you do that to Tom?
Tom is learning how to drive a car.
Did you ever work with Tom?
Don't tell me you stole it.
How come I haven't seen you here before?
No one is downstairs.
I've learned to cook.
I miss my family.
I don't think Tom is fit for the job.
I'm not afraid of ghosts.
How does it feel to be a mother?
Looks like today will be a long day.
"He is a British citizen, but lives in India."
There is a cat on the chair.
Do you know who they arrested?
Explain your idea more clearly.
Were you surprised?
The windows were already open when I got here.
I'm not a good liar.
She's been very busy this week.
Is Tom Jackson your real name?
Tom looks upset.
I think I remember you.
Tom graduated from Harvard.
Stay out of here.
He's a scriptwriter.
I don't think I can handle it.
I'm tired of waiting in line.
I don't care what you want.
He is likely to arrive soon.
"We're safe in here, aren't we?"
Give me that box.
The mirror was shattered.
Tom is just a little bit shorter than you.
It's supposed to rain tonight.
Tom and Mary fell in love with each other.
We need to act fast.
Tom's palms became sweaty.
I like your hair.
Dark clouds gathered over the horizon.
Tom will cook.
I want the work done quickly.
The skin is the largest organ of the body.
Tom never kisses me.
I wish I had gone to Australia with Tom.
A telephone is something you can't do without.
I've seen you do that.
Can I have a cup of coffee?
I wonder what we should do.
Tom poked the fire with a stick.
"In case I can't come, I'll give you a call beforehand."
She talked him into buying her a diamond ring.
How much do you want?
You said you wanted to see me.
She tried to kill herself.
Tom probably likes Mary.
They won't be in time.
I don't think it's a good decision.
I have to go shopping. I'll be back in an hour.
Tom was sitting in the backseat.
What is your aim in life?
See you at school.
I found the key in Tom's jacket pocket.
I've received it too.
Are you the manager?
Will you go with us?
That's a brilliant idea.
No one ever comes to visit me.
Do you want one of them?
Tom is waiting at the bus stop.
You could at least pretend to be interested in what I'm talking about.
This is your own fault.
The baby in the cradle is very cute.
These questions were written by Tom.
Can you guess what I'm thinking?
How big an idiot are you?
I sometimes cook dinner.
I knew you were coming today.
I think Tom will go to Australia.
Tom and Mary are discussing the problem.
Don't call me.
I know what you did last night.
Tom's face turned red.
I paid good money for this.
When did you win this award?
Tom said he would buy it.
Tom put his notebook away.
All I want to do now is sleep.
Who do you plan to go to Australia with?
Life ain't easy.
Don't you get bored when you're alone?
Do you want me to help you with your homework?
Your plan worked.
It isn't your fault.
I will give you a bicycle for your birthday.
Tom was sure he could win.
Tom was thirty when he died.
Where did you read that?
I went there for the purpose of meeting him.
That's the friend I gave the key to.
Your time is up.
He's looking at me.
I'm a Canadian citizen.
I see Tom every day.
You wouldn't have recognized Tom.
It's time to eat.
Would you like to sing?
Pass me the wine.
I saw what you were doing.
Quit behaving like a kid.
I wonder if this water is drinkable.
They are in favor of your plan.
Is your wife a good cook?
Tom and I decided to break up.
I don't really care about that.
Both Tom and John married Canadian women.
I want you to bring it to me.
I've already packed.
I insist that I'm innocent.
You're going to regret this.
"Many people believe that, but it's not true."
I doubt Tom will like that.
Are you sure that's all?
The coal industry is dying.
Where are your grandchildren?
I'd like to see you before I leave for Europe.
Could you take my picture?
Have you come to save me?
I am acquainted with the chairman of the committee.
Change your clothes.
"That toilet brush belongs in the bathroom, not in the kitchen."
How did you know that I'd say yes?
I think I broke my arm.
I don't want to stay with Tom.
Tom and Mary shared the cost.
Tom is afraid of you.
I think I need more time.
The soldiers surrounded the village.
Tom has lost 30 pounds.
We were both afraid to talk.
We broke up on Valentine's Day.
How could Tom possibly know that?
What has become of your sister?
What would Tom do without us?
Do you want to impress me?
The class start at ten.
I told him what to do.
Eat something.
I know you lied to Tom.
Who else did you talk to?
You might as well eat now.
You were our last hope.
I've been in Australia way longer than you have.
When did you move to Berlin?
One of your neighbors complained.
I bet you're right.
Put those books back on the shelf.
We'll never do it.
Tom danced.
What? I can't hear what you're saying.
Tom doesn't like traveling alone.
Mary has beautiful eyes.
I have to change the batteries in the radio.
I saw Tom's daughter last week.
I'm leaving on Monday.
She's adorable.
One of you is lying.
I didn't know this at the time.
I'm not thin.
I hope he's wrong.
You owe me a kiss.
It's for us.
What's your favorite holiday?
Tom is in better shape than John.
Almost no one believed her.
I like studying languages.
I have a boiled egg for breakfast every day.
Didn't you know I'd do that?
I'll phone you when I arrive.
Tom never apologized to me for that.
I don't need anything from you.
Leave it there.
Tom never laughs.
There isn't anything Tom is afraid of.
I love them.
I need a pencil. Can I use one of yours?
"She is not a nurse, but a doctor."
I wanted to go home.
I shouldn't have left you alone.
Tom won't do that without Mary.
Do you really want to help?
Tom fooled them.
I'm not that surprised.
Can I join you?
Does anybody here have a corkscrew?
The bus was empty.
I have really bad eyes.
I baked it for you.
Do you think that Tom will cry?
They found this.
I've got to see you.
You've always hated me.
It was a mess.
Please reread the article.
I didn't know Tom wanted to do that.
Could you help me translate that into French?
There is a shopping area nearby.
Tom is a kid.
I would like some envelopes.
I didn't tell you to do that.
Why did you tell Tom where I was?
You can sit next to me.
Put it in the closet.
He likes to travel by himself.
I wish we could ask Tom to help us.
Tom will most likely win.
I want a bath.
I'm too tired to drive.
He was playing the piano and she was singing.
You did an incredible job.
She told him all about her childhood.
I told Tom not to swim too long.
I can do that if you help me.
Tom had no idea that I would be here.
Tom lives in the apartment next to Mary.
Please call him.
Tom would never agree to that.
We should've never done that.
Today was a very tough day.
Tom teases me all the time.
Come join us.
That's not why Tom didn't win.
What really happened between you and Tom?
Tom has constructive ideas.
Do you want to get married and have children?
"They won't let you in, Tom."
Tom has already finished the work.
Tom was barefoot.
The car turned right when it reached the corner.
Tom and Mary argued about religion.
I wouldn't want to bother Tom.
My eyesight isn't very good.
Just calm down.
Does that surprise you?
I knew Tom was here.
Tom made the same mistake as before.
She teased him.
I doubt Tom will tell us the truth.
Were you home yesterday?
The others weren't so lucky.
Tom thought you would do that.
The bus that Tom is on should be here soon.
"I told you not to call me Tom, didn't I?"
Open your book to page nine.
Is it true that you caught a scorpion?
Where shall we go?
Are you going away this summer?
I knew that Tom would kiss Mary.
What's your size?
That store is exceptionally expensive.
"Will you play the piano tomorrow? ""No, I won't."""
Give me one more.
That's fairly reasonable.
"Hurry up, or you won't catch up with him."
"I am planning to visit Kyoto, and Nara as well."
I didn't know that you had so many cats.
She left him for another man.
She doesn't take after her mother at all.
It's a very touching story.
I saw what you did.
I knew that Tom didn't do that on purpose.
Can we help you with something?
Divorce is becoming more common nowadays.
You're a good listener.
Nobody ever helped me.
Tom pretended he was asleep.
Take precautions.
He was talking nonsense.
I take it that's unusual.
Promise you won't laugh.
Try to be polite.
We have to prepare for that.
Do you think what she said is a lie?
Tom hasn't yet been sentenced.
I'm very concerned about your health.
Do you see a star?
Can I kiss you?
She became famous.
May I use the vacuum cleaner?
We must find a way to do that.
Tom can't hide the truth anymore.
I have a few things I have to do before I can go home tonight.
Can you tell me what this is about?
I didn't want to tell you this.
May I have a word with you?
Tom believes in life after death.
Didn't you know that Tom and Mary were dating?
I know Tom isn't a racist.
I like fish more than meat.
This picture must have been taken in 1964.
Tom stood behind Mary.
We'll give you a ride.
Tom wanted to change.
Yes. You're absolutely right.
You'll have to go.
I sleep at night now.
I just want to know.
I didn't lose it.
I wasn't complaining about that.
Tom works for his father's company.
Tom wasn't able to find what he needed.
The soldier gave water to me.
I have just finished eating lunch.
I am on medication.
Tom is washing his car.
Tom didn't look very busy to me.
Restart your computer.
I'm a little nervous.
Tom has already begun.
It's very sensitive.
He was run over by a car.
The pilot bailed out before the plane crashed.
Don't let Tom close the door.
Do you want to pray?
How will I be able to do that?
It's so painfully obvious.
He wants to be like me.
I had a quarrel with him over money.
Tom came in through the window.
I said drop your gun!
I don't know if I can trust Tom.
I'm not sure that I share your optimism.
You must be strong.
I think we're lost.
Tom has never fallen in love.
I'm desperate.
Do you think we should worry?
I've hired a new lawyer.
"To be on the safe side, she went to hospital."
Tom is just plain lazy.
Tom never shouts.
There's some whiskey in that bottle.
I've decided not to leave.
I don't want you to come back to Boston.
I asked Tom when he had started studying French.
When did you do this?
Tom never said what he was planning to do.
I'm already in bed.
They crossed the border into Spain.
I have to peel the apples.
You can have a slice of pizza if you want.
It's too bright to sleep.
"I want to go with you, Tom."
I use ordinary slips of paper as bookmarks.
I put my shoes under the bed.
Your pulse is normal.
I thought that you'd find it interesting.
"You don't remember, do you?"
We became friends.
I tasted the wine.
Tom seldom comes to Boston.
Tom didn't know where his family was.
Don't do anything you'll regret.
Let's talk about why you're here.
I want a room for tonight.
Tom thinks that Mary won't forget to do that.
I read a lot of books last summer.
She will come here before long.
Tell Tom to change his shirt.
When did you go?
That's not how the world works.
Tom thinks that Mary won't win.
Tom has a house with two rooms.
She doesn't like living downtown.
Tom is mad at Mary for calling him stupid.
He is a compulsive gambler.
Do you want half of this cake?
Tom walks his dogs every day.
The book is for me; the flowers are for you.
I bought new sunglasses.
"I borrowed money not only from Tom, but from his wife, too."
When will you leave?
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.
Look at my arm.
Tom likes to do that.
I thought we could help you.
China is rich in natural resources.
How many years were you in Boston?
Tom is next.
You're quite smart.
I have a lot of things to do.
I made a mess of that.
We're not a couple.
Tom mistook me for my sister.
I dream about going to Tunisia in a few years.
I wasn't surprised when Tom told me I didn't need to do that.
You're not going to win.
Your cough worries me.
I still don't understand what you want from me.
Tom has tried to kill himself.
Tom is afraid of heights.
Tom said Mary wasn't sleeping.
Black smoke came out of the chimney.
Don't be cruel.
Tom said he didn't intend to stay.
We've never had a problem with Tom before.
What time do you think he'll be back?
That was the last one.
We haven't done anything wrong.
She is hard on him.
I still can't believe it happened.
You can't ask me to do this.
Tell me your names.
I wasn't able to defend myself.
Your wife's on the phone. She says it's urgent.
I haven't got a clue.
Tom grabbed a piece of wood and hit Mary with it.
I know that Tom isn't busy.
This is the best one.
Tom was scared of something.
We'll be well paid.
Tom didn't have a girlfriend.
I know your language.
The first step is realizing that you have a problem.
How many boys are there in your class?
Tom and Mary have three children.
It was difficult for me to do that.
Go when you want.
Tom has asked us not to do anything.
Did Tom give any other suggestions?
Nobody was home.
Tom is only thirty years old.
You seem to know everything about this.
I met her in the winter three years ago.
She dressed herself quickly.
Tom knew who Mary wanted to talk to.
Do we have time?
Turn the page.
Do you really think Tom will cry?
The table is made of wood.
Tom didn't say when he was planning to do that.
I never thought I'd be doing this alone.
Everybody is different.
Stay in this room.
Don't use this apparatus near water.
Tom can swim faster than anyone else I know.
Tom is a bookkeeper.
We don't know where Tom is now.
Are you still mad at me?
You've got willpower.
Why didn't you stop them?
They needed privacy.
What are we having for dinner tonight?
Tom said he couldn't wait any longer.
It looks like the thief came in through the window.
Tom ate too much cotton candy.
Tom looked at the price tag and realized he didn't have enough money.
Did you have a favorite book as a child?
How long do you think it takes to go from here to Tokyo?
Didn't I show you my new Mustang?
I locked myself out.
I hope you can help me with this.
I probably should've said something.
I need to sleep now.
I must know the truth about Tom.
Tom is the best singer in our class.
Tom couldn't take his socks off.
Tom's eyes widened.
Why didn't you ask Tom to do that?
"If I'd known, I would've told you."
I had a cup of tea to keep myself awake.
You don't need to wait for me.
I stood up again.
It never occurred to me that Tom might say no.
I wanted to kill Tom.
It's easy to sing.
I only speak French.
Tom is here to deliver a message.
Someone must have left the water running.
I wasn't saying that.
Tom doesn't need it.
Do you like oranges?
"To tell the truth, I didn't notice it."
Nixon became very angry.
Tom and I were both laughing.
You're my age.
We should tell Tom.
Yours was better than mine.
I don't want to listen to your whining anymore.
Tom walked out on Mary.
The policeman spoke to a man on the street.
Please don't tell anyone that I did that.
Tom has already told me what needs to be done.
He isn't smart enough to add up numbers in his head.
You can rely on me.
We could ask Tom not to go.
"Before you go to visit him, you should make sure he's at home."
Mary married Tom after his wife died.
I held my breath and waited.
Tom isn't such a bad person.
Who do you think'll be at the party?
I think Tom can help Mary do that.
Clean the barrel of this rifle.
What on earth is the problem?
I think Tom is going to get fired.
I didn't go.
"In fact, it's a mistake."
You're too young to worry about cellulite.
Grab on to something.
It wasn't that difficult.
You look fantastic in that dress.
I still don't understand what you want from me.
You didn't let me answer.
Do you find Mary attractive?
Wait here.
It's time for bed.
He burst out laughing.
Will you sing today?
I don't think that I can explain the difference.
That's all I'm asking.
I doubt you'll be able to do that.
I need to discuss something with you.
Have you already eaten dinner?
"They're talking about you, Tom."
I heard the door open.
Tom agreed with us.
French was the only foreign language they taught at my school.
Look what I found in the woods.
I wish Tom would smile more often.
Women share everything.
I don't have anything to give to you.
Ants and giraffes are distant cousins.
Why didn't you answer me when I called?
You're probably mistaken.
Did you see who did it?
Do you promise never to lie again?
Tom didn't say when he was planning to do that.
I thought that the meeting had been canceled.
It isn't a dog.
I'm trying to make a good first impression.
Please tell Tom that Mary called.
I couldn't let Tom go.
Tom has done a very good job.
I love rock musicians.
I hid myself in the bushes.
I'll leave that up to you.
I left.
I suspect Tom doesn't want to do that today.
We always take a bus.
Thank you again for your help.
We can just about read each other's minds.
Tom phoned to say he's not coming.
Does anyone of you know them?
I think we're all a bit crazy.
I hope I'll see Tom tomorrow.
Tom was executed three months ago.
This car is easy to drive.
Where did you see it?
It happened between eight and ten.
She has forgiven him for everything.
She says that she likes flowers.
I haven't paid the fine yet.
You should not go there.
We needed all that.
Tom saw that he was wrong.
You're really frightening me.
Who helped Tom do that?
I want to tell you something important.
Why would they do this to me?
I'm very lonely here.
I've been very busy lately.
Tom should've listened to us.
Tom's good at his job.
None of the books in my library are in French.
How much jam should I buy?
He heard a cry for help.
What time did you wake up?
Will you go with us?
Tom seems more interested in getting things done than in getting things done right.
Tom knows people.
Tom is proud of himself.
Father gives Mother all his salary.
It was noisy.
Did Tom run?
Tom's a very pessimistic person and always sees the negative side of any situation.
Don't you want to walk again?
May we have a short recess?
Tom handed it to Mary.
You will tell me everything.
There are twenty-four hours in a day.
What exactly are you trying to say?
Tom finally got the courage to propose to his girlfriend.
Tom often dreams of his girlfriend.
Do you know what that is?
"If anyone can do that, it's Tom."
That's the worst.
Do you think Tom is making a mistake?
Tom crashed his car a week after he bought it.
Are these your keys?
Tom has made a very big mistake.
This is going to take some time to explain.
You lied to me.
I can't lose.
Do you blame me?
Did you already do your homework?
The meat was tender.
The chimney caught on fire and the house burned down.
I'll tell you all about it later.
I'm important.
Tom is now 13 years old.
Tom went to Boston by car.
He has never been abroad.
Are those guys your friends?
I don't want to keep doing this.
What just happened?
Tom isn't able to do it.
Tom has been grouchy all morning.
It's strange that you don't know anything about that matter.
How much longer will I have to stay in the hospital?
Something frightened Tom.
I'm still at Tom's house.
I don't know the name of that temple.
He is getting better.
Don't worry. Tom won't let us down.
I don't have a visa.
"For example, do you like English?"
"No, that's not true."
Tom is older than Mary.
I gave it back.
Tom forgot about the meeting.
School begins on April the tenth.
What if I'm wrong?
I'm glad we're best friends.
"Tom lives near the ocean, but he can't swim."
What will they do to us?
Tom is usually busier than Mary.
They want to be with you.
You're the only person I can count on.
I don't know what to say.
Is there anything I can do to help you?
Think about how you'd feel if that happened to you.
Tom ordered a drink.
Would you like to be rich?
I beat Tom at chess.
Here's the book.
Tom has always been a pig.
It's a quarter to three.
I always knew that you could do that.
Let me help you.
It's time to put the children to bed.
You have to be careful.
"Come in, the door's open."
Tom told me his father could speak French.
Tom is afraid of doctors.
Tom got so absorbed in his work that he forgot to eat.
Is it big?
It is not good to laugh at others.
You should've told me in advance.
Keep your shoes on.
You have beautiful legs.
The horse is thirsty.
I thought that you were dating Tom.
Have you ever been hypnotized?
I know people.
No one answered.
Do you want us to take you home?
Have you taken a bath yet?
I think I know what to do.
I don't think this weather will hold.
I think that Tom is still in love with Mary.
All of them were handmade things.
You look good in that dress.
You have been busy.
Please close the door quietly.
I'm drinking a beer.
Tom didn't know when he'd be back.
We were told to do that.
Tom is waiting at the gate.
Why don't you ask Tom yourself?
Don't be late for school.
Tom blamed Mary for that.
I knew Tom wouldn't wait for Mary.
Tell Tom that I'll do it.
Why do we have to do that today?
"OK, I'll order it."
Tom forgot his password.
Tom knew Mary was worried.
Don't kill me.
What was your first tattoo?
You told me not to do it.
I'm Tom's rival.
I want this one myself.
Why are you telling this to me now?
Try to get some sleep.
I never leave my house unlocked.
He walked across the street.
Are you staying for dinner?
Things might've turned out better if you hadn't gone there.
Tell them to do it now.
I haven't heard from him for ages.
Listen to yourself.
One does not wear a red mini skirt to a funeral.
How does it feel being married?
"How are you? ""I am fine, thank you."""
Tom no longer lives with his parents.
Have you ever been to a costume party?
"If you do not have this program, you can download it now."
We calmed down.
Reading is my passion.
"Tom said he would come, but he never showed up."
Please turn off the radio and turn on the TV.
"You're home early, aren't you?"
"That's interesting, but beside the point."
He is eighteen weeks old.
When does he get back from his trip?
Tom has already been asked not to do that again.
Maybe I need a new assistant.
I always wanted to go to Boston.
I am Chinese.
I don't care what people say about me.
This is a picture of the airport.
"I don't have a lot of money, but I get along somehow."
I didn't know that Mary was Tom's mother.
Nobody is here.
Keep your thoughts to yourself.
You were busy.
At least the robber was civil to us.
Do you plan to work until 10:00?
"Judging from the look of the sky, it is likely to rain."
I want him to play the guitar.
Are you finished with your work?
I'm sure there'll be no problem.
She couldn't answer the question.
He is very kind.
I'll be with Tom and Mary.
I still do that.
Tom and Mary nodded to each other.
Tom says Mary will win.
I can't tell you what I'm going to do.
We used to be on the same team.
I'm not the one who needs to lose weight.
Tom didn't want to live any longer.
We'd like to speak with you.
I'm a mess.
This book is not available in Japan.
Tom got upset when he found out Mary was leaving.
Can you tell me what happened?
Nobody could decide as to what to do.
Tom told me he was going to clean up his room.
Tom didn't think Mary was right.
I don't recall asking for your advice.
I've never been in love.
You must find work.
Do you want me to tell you why?
I don't think Tom knows how to play the saxophone.
How do you know all that stuff?
I'll never let you down.
Who cares?
Is it big?
Tom reminded me to stop at the supermarket and buy some bread.
The police are now investigating the cause of the accident.
I didn't know Tom was a drug addict.
Let's never lose hope.
Tom and Mary had to postpone their wedding.
We arrived at the station as the train was leaving.
That's exactly what we want.
Tom is going to take you home.
I can't guarantee that that's going to happen.
Tom doesn't care what happens tomorrow.
I have children.
Let me get this straight.
Tom just started.
You've got a good idea.
I'm not supposed to do that.
I interpreted their silence as consent.
Tom denied that he was the thief.
Tom wants to be the winner.
They're not that stupid.
They're going to hear us.
I don't think that you'd be able to do that.
The decision is Tom's.
Please let me take a day off tomorrow.
I don't think that we did anything wrong.
I was sober.
He cannot stop it.
Tom made Mary angry.
Have you washed your hands yet?
I must be going.
Tom carefully took off his mask.
Tom ate cornflakes for breakfast.
I want you to call Tom now.
Tom promised he would be there.
This is the most beautiful ostrich I've ever seen.
It's pretty exciting.
Do you still live with Tom?
I understand you have a problem.
Tom got very angry.
I haven't had lunch.
Who wrote this story?
Who told you I would be here?
Where do you see him?
In the middle of the table stood a vase of roses.
I don't see what's wrong with that.
I didn't call you stupid.
Tom wanted to visit America.
Make yourself at home.
Tom's wife died last week.
Tom was hoping he could help Mary do that.
Tom washes his car every morning.
Tom could do nothing but watch Mary being swept down the river.
I had my money stolen.
Tom was on the floor.
Tom was the only one who came to help.
I was out for a walk.
Do you carry a weapon?
What are you doing in my room?
Tom and I have that in common.
Tom jumped into the water.
Police arrested the kidnapper.
Do you think that I look like Tom?
They're trying.
Please tell me the story once more.
I've sent you something.
I always listen to you.
I trust your advice.
I have bad breath.
Tom borrowed a book from Mary.
Save me a seat.
Tom said I was the only one who believed him.
Tom said he didn't even want to think about that.
I'm accustomed to this.
Do you like singing?
Let's see what's wrong with it.
This is a post office and that is a bank.
Do you really think Tom is better than me?
We have the facts.
Please tell me what's happening.
What was it that you did there?
I want to do that myself.
They won't wait long.
I'll drive you home.
They go to work on foot.
You will learn.
You're too polite.
Tom hasn't signed a contract yet.
I'd have told you that.
How long will I have to wait?
Where will we go?
Tom crosses the railroad tracks every morning on his way to work.
Everybody here knows me.
Everybody's different.
I'd like to pay in cash.
Women usually live longer than men.
Thank you for telling me that.
You've got to win today.
I thought it'd be great if we could get Tom to play a few songs for us.
Go with who you want to go with.
I lost consciousness.
He is in poor health.
Start again.
I don't have a sister.
I'm a married man.
I can't live that kind of life.
Do you want to be with me or not?
Did you really think I wouldn't tell Tom?
How many do you have left?
"If you can't afford a lawyer, one will be appointed to you."
Tom isn't a very good cook.
You're getting more and more beautiful.
I think you might need me.
Can you hurry up?
You have to help.
Tom didn't win the contest.
I'm not to be disturbed.
I just want to sit in a corner and cry.
I know that you didn't do that.
I never for a moment imagined I'd be able to afford to live in such a fancy house.
Tom and Mary kept quiet.
Please be serious.
I'm under quarantine.
I have to think.
I know that's who you're looking for.
He jumped to get a ball.
Tom nodded yes.
We have a good negotiator on the staff.
I'm going to do that for you.
How do you expect us to help?
Tom won't be able to do that without my help.
Should I wait for her to come back?
Tom often goes shopping alone.
"Tom, have you eaten anything?"
It will take an act of Congress to change that law.
I've never left Australia.
The British finally retreated.
Tom is shaving in his room.
"If you don't want to attend Tom's birthday party, you don't have to."
Tom doesn't like soccer.
Let's go back home.
I wish I spoke more French.
Does Tom still swim every day?
I'm sure Tom doesn't do that anymore.
Tom wasn't thirsty.
Tom seems to be very surprised.
Tom delivers pizza.
That disagreement resulted in a complete break between them.
Modern art doesn't interest me.
Where did Tom get that coat?
Tom drew two squares on the blackboard.
Tom sometimes does that and sometimes he doesn't.
Tom said that Mary was optimistic.
I don't know how to ride a horse.
Tom used to work as a waiter.
I met Tom the other day.
Are you dissatisfied with our decision?
I will be more careful.
You don't have to commit yourself unless you want to.
Tom handed Mary a cup of hot coffee.
I'd love to have breakfast with you.
Did you do that on purpose?
We need to buy some more food.
How old were you when the war broke out?
He's in a bad mood.
They like to wear bright colors.
Tom still writes poems.
I knew you'd kiss Tom.
We can't let that happen.
Can I get a glass of water?
Tom moved close to Mary.
We should get to Chicago by lunchtime.
Tom is a good musician.
My name was called after his name.
Are you the manager?
There's not much coffee left.
I think it's dangerous to swim in this lake.
Why don't you go out?
We've known each other for years.
You must eat something.
I know what you were doing.
"I'd love to go, but I can't."
Do you have that in blue?
You can get used to anything.
I have no comment at this time.
I want Tom out of my life.
I got the pears for nothing.
Look who's there.
His job is to negotiate with foreign buyers.
Tom can take it.
Tom told Mary what John did.
Why didn't you tell me that Tom needed to do that?
I got injured doing that.
Please keep this a secret.
I thought that was well known.
Can you help me translate this?
It was very helpful.
I don't think your mother will like it.
I've never been to my grandfather's house.
Your book is here.
Has Tom already eaten lunch?
Thank you for the invitation.
You don't look busy.
Will you give it to me?
Thank you for protecting us.
That can't be possible.
Tom will be here with me.
Does Tom have a license?
Who stood?
Tom asked me who cried.
I don't know what it's called.
I'll go with you if necessary.
Are you going to tell Tom?
Why is that red light blinking?
I'll phone Tom tonight.
Do it yourself by all means.
Everybody knows she married him for his money.
Tell me why I can't go.
Take mine.
Tom is a happy boy.
I will take you home.
Your guitar is better than mine.
How did Tom get into your house?
Tom has other responsibilities.
I could not help laughing at his jokes.
Which one do you like most?
Tom's parents were also singers.
We want to get back there as soon as we can.
I'm not that easily intimidated.
Tom eats less than Mary.
Nothing'll happen.
Tom gave me some good advice.
I don't think that Tom knows very much about Mary.
I'm not really an expert.
Let me under your umbrella.
Tell me more about this.
Guess how much it cost me.
Tom came back into the office.
This was my dad's favorite tie.
The new teacher is more like a friend than a teacher.
Should we make the suggested changes?
Tom didn't help anybody.
Tom is not who you think he is.
Tom won't be happy to see me.
What've you been doing all this time?
Tom has a poor memory.
I don't know anything about him at all.
He asked her why she was crying.
He is always bothering me to lend him money.
Everybody loves her.
We never go to bed before midnight.
I wish I could break the habit of smoking.
Tom waited impatiently.
I advise you to go to Boston with Tom.
Tom couldn't say what he wanted to say.
I hate long flights.
Do you recognize that man?
Tom is going to investigate.
I wish I hadn't eaten that.
His daughter was endowed with beauty and grace.
I thought I'd lost you forever.
I didn't see anyone in the park.
I tried everything I could.
Tom looked a little flustered.
Tom can't stop.
Was I talking to you?
Aren't you the only one who has a key to this door?
This isn't a very good company.
I'll write to you.
I could be wrong.
I didn't know Tom had gotten fired.
You've got 24 hours.
Mary swears like a sailor.
How do you know you can trust Tom?
We were disconnected.
What does Tom want from me?
What does that prove?
What's your address?
I wish I hadn't played chess with Tom.
Are we nearly there?
I climbed the tree.
"I cannot go to the party, but thank you for inviting me all the same."
You'll need money.
Did you recognize any of those people?
Tom had to admit that Mary was right.
I'll never come back here again.
Tom said he ate too much.
Nobody called Tom.
They were snowed in for a whole week.
Can you spare me a couple of minutes?
Tom likes country music.
Tom said that he'd also do that.
Stop showing off!
Tom seems rather free with his insults.
It isn't worth it.
Tom saw Mary smile.
I did everything I could today.
The situation gets worse and worse.
We'll be better off in the long run.
Tom began to suspect that Mary was cheating on him.
You look stupid.
I bought a used car.
Didn't you know Tom was in Australia last week?
Tom asked how much the fare was.
He studies history at college.
I don't have much faith in his ability.
Could you turn it down?
You really mean a lot to me.
Is that why you asked me to come here?
Tom was afraid to cross the road.
"How long have you been running this place, Tom?"
This isn't ink.
"You bought candles, didn't you?"
I had no choice but to go.
You must get going.
I'm not helpless.
Why is Tom always so sleepy?
This is the important part.
Where's your hotel?
Go wait outside.
Tom didn't fall down.
My father goes for a walk every morning.
I didn't want it.
How could I be so stupid?
This apple has started to rot.
You can't handle the truth.
How many boys are in your class?
I called Tom a taxi.
I'm following you.
Tom promised not to tell Mary about what happened.
Do you think something will happen soon?
Tom did it all alone.
What happened in Boston?
He's fluent in Japanese.
I've never been in love before.
Tom and Mary plan to be together for the rest of their lives.
I wish Tom had told me about that earlier.
Tom is better at chess than I am.
How long has it been since your divorce?
He ran the fastest of all.
How is your family name written?
You're very persuasive.
Don't you see what you've become?
Tom was robbed again.
I received a letter from my brother.
"Tom is afraid of Mary, isn't he?"
Do Tom and Mary get along?
Please bring me a glass of water.
Tom has three sons and one daughter.
I've told them all about you.
Tom left Mary a message.
Tom was married twice.
You may go anywhere.
I think that Tom will be able to do that today.
Try to stay positive.
Today isn't Monday.
Everyone knows that I hate Tom.
Do we have milk in the fridge?
Tom wanted to protect himself.
Tom was a reporter.
Tom's missing.
Why isn't Tom in the car?
"Do you have a mobile, Tom?"
Well done!
This place is beautiful.
Tom can't afford a lawyer.
Do you want a car?
They washed their hands.
Tom didn't know how to reply.
Don't leave the room.
Money does not smell.
Tom wanted to be an artist.
Tom and I lost touch after we graduated.
Tom is helping Mary with her research.
Tom married young.
We can't pretend that it didn't happen.
Germany is about half the size of Texas.
I suspect Tom and Mary were busy all day.
Who bought you this?
Tom was so happy.
Don't be so sentimental.
You can't teach a crab how to walk straight.
We visited Boston and Chicago.
You must do as I tell you.
I hope you won't tell Tom about this.
"The phone was ringing, but there was no one to answer it."
I've never lived abroad.
"Pass me the salt and pepper, please."
Tell Tom what's going on here.
Don't say it again.
Tom cried with me.
"If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be here now."
"Tom is in his room, packing a suitcase."
When did you get married?
This is the key I have been looking for.
She is used to getting up early.
Be attentive.
I tried not to think about that.
Do you remember the title of that book?
We'd better leave early.
You said you were going to buy a new car.
They're separated.
Tom says he wants to help you.
I ate three hot dogs.
How did Tom find out where I live?
Muslims bury their dead in graves.
I read the letter to him.
The police officer removed Tom's handcuffs.
Will you tell Tom?
I'm a bit scared.
Do you have a handkerchief?
Tom is preparing dinner.
I was very sad.
I'm not a magician.
Do you know where Tom might've gone?
Tom has a big day tomorrow.
Someone is following us.
I told you I'd help you.
How can people be so stupid and ignorant?
I can no longer take care of myself.
Why are you so arrogant?
I was the one who convinced Tom not to do that anymore.
Tom needed a job.
Tom understands the situation.
That's why we have to leave.
They set a new record for the longest kiss.
Tom said that he was unemployed.
Do you like the food here?
At least we know Tom can swim.
You're magnificent.
I think you know that we have to help Tom.
I know that I can be replaced.
We've decided to postpone the meeting till next Monday.
Don't you think it's a little too big?
Where's the hospital?
Tom spent a lot of time talking with Mary.
I think we're going to be OK.
I'll pour you a glass of wine.
Tom noticed that Mary had a new hairstyle.
I came on foot.
Tom simply told the truth.
I like these.
Tom has got to take that risk.
All the passengers were requested to get off the train.
She is at church right now.
You know as well as I do that we will die here.
She is content with his present salary.
Tom said that he was homeless.
When did you decide that?
"I don't have a brother, but I have two sisters."
When did this package arrive?
I didn't go anywhere.
Roses have thorns.
Give me all your money.
Bring me something to eat.
I need to know how this happened.
I ordered that book over a week ago.
I told Tom I understood his concern.
Smoking is a disgusting habit.
Don't drag me into this.
You were a teenager then.
That's what I'm hoping for.
Did you really go there?
Education starts at home.
A person with common sense would never do this kind of thing.
I don't know anything about Tom's problem.
This ticket is valid for only two days after its purchase.
Tom recognized the smell.
That is mine.
I want to know who broke this window.
How did you get to know Mary?
Tom didn't seem to understand your explanation.
They bought a box of cookies.
"We're almost home now, Tom."
You're so picky.
I wish that I had gone to Australia with Tom.
Go and see who it is.
I am afraid that they don't get along very well.
They won't allow us to enter the garden.
He's stupid.
My father spoils me.
It's all so sad.
Are you sure Tom won't remember anything?
How long did it take you to write the report?
The water turned to ice.
Close the window before going to bed.
I know Tom has tried to do that.
Is there any chance that he'll recover?
Tom turned on the car radio.
They're predicting rain.
Do you think I would leave you here?
Is that what you wanted to say?
They invited her to go to the party.
I'm not used to Boston yet.
I knew you wanted to do that.
I didn't know Tom was your uncle.
How many books do you read per month?
Do you think Tom is still home?
Tom showed us a picture of his girlfriend.
The pond was completely frozen in the morning.
She died a miserable death.
Don't quibble about the details.
Maybe it's worth it.
Can't you leave me alone?
Repetition does not transform a lie into a truth.
Keep your shoulders straight.
How will this affect us?
Leave if you wish.
My father was about to leave when the phone rang.
My wisdom tooth hurts.
Tom told me he likes swimming.
Love is stronger than death.
I wonder who made all this.
"That brown one is mine, too."
Turn on the TV.
You're a naive person.
Her sudden appearance in the doorway surprised us.
Tom didn't want to do that here.
You're a very interesting woman.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go with him.
Lightning struck the tower.
We watched the baby snuggling with her teddy bear.
We're not staying.
Don't hang up.
Tom did that with ease.
You don't even try to help me.
Aren't you going to eat with us?
I have a little money now.
Tom was gone for three hours.
I've spent all the money you gave me.
Did you invite Tom?
I was hoping you could help me.
What did you go there for?
Grandfather is still very active for his age.
I want you to go and see if it's still there.
He looked around uneasily.
It may rain.
Tom called Mary back the next day.
Tom won't be home on Monday.
I'm so glad you like it.
Tom and I'll visit Boston.
This is a bad idea.
What in the world does that mean?
Tom isn't hungry.
She had reached her goal.
Bend down. The ceiling is very low.
Go help Tom.
I didn't know Tom knew Mary.
He doesn't care about money.
I can't drink coffee without sugar.
You don't have to go there.
We became best friends immediately.
Tom isn't a doctor.
I thought you said it was yours.
Why is Tom so early?
This is your chance.
No river in the world is longer than the Nile.
Do you want us to take you home?
I assume you still live in Boston.
Give us a break.
Tom's wife died in 2013.
Tom met his wife in Boston.
How much did Tom pay you?
They canceled.
It was my turn.
Who are those men in white suits?
We don't need to do this every day.
I don't have insurance.
"Tom is a dentist, isn't he?"
Tom is playing frisbee.
You're very lucky.
I don't have a prejudice against foreign workers.
We did it according to your instructions.
Why did you shave off your beard?
I'll do it some other time.
I've already told you what's happening.
There's free food.
I received your letter yesterday.
I don't know where he comes from.
Tom is intimidated by Mary.
I opened that box.
You're the one who hired Tom.
What a mess!
She scolded him for not mowing the lawn.
No one could sleep that night.
This is exactly what I've been looking for.
This is difficult for Tom.
"Tom intended to ask his boss for a raise, but he reconsidered."
Are you seeing anybody?
I'll need some help.
Stop being such a baby.
Tell me who else is on your list.
Tom tried not to make a sound.
Tom was late.
Do you want Tom to win?
Come again any time.
Tom calculated the expenses.
I wanted to be free.
He is an individual with his own living space and his own sleeping space.
She keeps moaning that she has no time.
I started studying French when I was thirteen.
We are flying to Los Angeles tomorrow.
Do you know who these skis belong to?
Tom got a voice mail from Mary.
We both were really drunk.
I'm pretty sure Tom won't do that.
"We have you to thank for that, Tom."
He made up his mind to go there alone.
Is that all that you can say?
What exactly do you know about Tom?
I don't think we need to worry.
I didn't cry at Tom's funeral.
I know you're right.
Tom thinks I'm in Boston now.
I'm getting tired of doing this.
I made him open the door.
Do you have any French magazines?
He is able to speak Japanese.
The train was crowded with people.
Tom will be back.
They're painting the cemetery wall.
I've caught the flu.
You don't have to tell that to your parents.
You didn't tell me Tom moved to Boston.
How's it going?
"Tom told a joke, but nobody laughed."
You changed it?
I thought that I had lost my keys.
I'll see you later.
I hope Tom didn't notice what you were doing.
Tom is no longer a teacher.
I'm quiet.
I told Tom where I'd gone.
I hope you remember to do that.
Tom is hoping you'll win.
Tom pulled out a knife.
The difference was unbelievable.
I don't know where to put it.
Tom refused to tell Mary what had happened.
I'm not unhappy.
How many books have you written?
That's a very common phrase where I come from.
Each state had just one vote.
I know something you don't know.
Can someone explain this to me?
Wasn't it enough?
I think that's enough for today.
I had intended to go there.
That's just an excuse.
Do you want to come with me?
Why did you listen to them?
He does nothing but complain from morning till night.
Tom lay awake all night.
Why don't you put on some clothes?
You can't beat me.
I've never seen you like this before.
What will it all cost?
Tom needed some time to think things over.
Why are you helping Tom?
"If I were free, I could help you."
Tom's condition has improved.
She and I usually agree.
Tom went outside to smoke.
"If you permit me to speak, I can explain everything."
How many English words do you know?
I knew a shortcut to Tom's house.
Stop smoking.
I still say it wasn't a good idea.
How much is your rent?
His car collided with a train.
I think you lied to me.
I don't know what else to tell you.
Put on a jacket.
You'll never stop me.
He lied to me. That is why I am angry with him.
Tom was the first one to get here this morning.
I thought you looked sad.
Tom says he'll teach me how to play chess.
I demand you give me back my money.
I have an older brother and an older sister.
I was naked.
This is one of the best beaches in Australia.
She is a pianist.
Which browser are you using?
This isn't your house.
I don't know why the door was open.
I will miss you all.
Tom didn't know how to solve this problem.
I don't know which one.
I like old cars.
Can anyone help me do this?
How much coffee do you drink every day?
Tom is probably still up.
We don't know where Tom went.
She expressed her thanks for the present.
Tom opened the door slightly.
I'm smoking a Cuban cigar.
I would have to agree with Tom.
I am pressed for time.
"Give the car a push for me, will you?"
I'll do whatever it takes to survive.
They got onto the plane.
I'm not sure that anybody would be willing to help me.
We'll order a pizza.
What're you going to be when you grow up?
Tom knows all that.
I had that feeling.
Tom knows that I'm married.
Tom sat up in bed and looked around.
I'm sure you understand why we can't do that.
Are you the one who took my knife?
Tom knew what Mary had said was true.
Tom isn't bluffing.
Tom hopes that Mary knows she shouldn't do what John has told her to do.
You are to stay here until we come back.
Tom had to make a difficult decision.
May I ask why?
I hadn't planned to tell you.
I don't want to be your enemy.
That wouldn't help either.
Where are Tom and Mary going?
You have a decision to make.
The weather is bad.
You've betrayed us again.
Tom is in.
I told Tom to leave you alone.
Nobody can replace me.
"Take it, or leave it."
Tom said he had a lot of money.
I want to speak to you.
I have already finished reading this book.
What haven't you told me?
I heard Tom talking on the phone.
I can't find my shoes.
I don't think that I have the experience necessary for that job.
Don't confuse comets and asteroids.
We went down to the valley where the village is.
I'm the one who asked you the question.
Tom is probably on a plane.
I can't come tonight.
I have a family.
Tom heard Mary talking in her sleep.
Tom retraced his steps.
She poured me a cup of tea.
I'm sure I can do what you're asking.
Tom has a solid alibi.
"I want one, but not this one."
Did you get my messages?
What do you do in your free time?
Don't climb on the wall.
Tom said that Mary was homesick.
Tom told me he wanted my help.
Could we speak to you?
Tom has a black eye.
I wholeheartedly endorse this decision.
This is the flag of Japan.
We wanted to talk to Tom.
Tom brought his brother.
Do you have the keys?
I had to go to work.
My grandmother raised me.
Tom is divorcing Mary.
Tom may know where Mary is.
I think Tom recognized me.
Please be frank with me.
I know who your secret admirer is.
Tom and Mary never met again.
I think I've broken my leg.
Don't leave us.
I thought you said nothing happened.
We should do this every Monday.
Bite your tongue!
Tom went there yesterday.
You're a bad father.
That was all Tom needed.
I couldn't stand the noise anymore.
I told you it was a waste of time.
I'm not sure my parents would want me to give you that.
My father retired at the age of 65.
Just do what you have to do.
We appreciate everything you have done.
Tom can see us.
Do you have anything for a cold?
Where can I rent a Halloween costume?
Tom thinks you're doing that wrong.
I'll keep an eye on you.
He showed a lot of enthusiasm for the development of new products.
"It's not easy, but we're going to do it anyway."
"As for myself, I'm OK."
Tom wants to learn how to play chess.
Do you work at all?
You must've thought I was an idiot.
She slowly moved forward.
I want you to have fun.
I was the only man.
Tom put the document on Mary's desk.
Take a look at this.
I have no time to engage in gossip.
I'm a good listener.
Someone called Tom.
Can you tell me what's bothering you?
What's your favorite memory from childhood?
Let me sing a song for you.
I was at home then.
There is no objection on my part.
Tom wasn't expecting to see Mary at the party.
Tom has told us so much about you.
He was not at all satisfied.
We often talk about you.
Tom says that he's never heard Mary sing.
I know Tom did that last week.
Tom doesn't sleep here.
I had a feeling you'd say that.
Tom now knows where Mary lives.
I have to wear boots.
The treatment is going successfully.
Tom won't come until Monday.
Tom was very sleepy and could hardly keep his eyes open.
"It's a good idea, but is it worth it?"
I wrote where I was working.
I threw the paper into the fire.
I did what you wanted me to do.
Why didn't you just tell us?
"When I came back, my car was gone."
You're the one I need now.
Tom seems to like you a lot.
I visited Boston last month.
Tom wants to take it.
That's what's supposed to happen.
Lock the door!
I didn't know you could do that.
I'm not waiting.
Tom won't tell me who he's dating.
You don't need to know where I keep my money.
I have a truck.
Tom may go with you if he wants.
The room was too crowded.
Tom won't be fired.
Tom promised not to harm Mary.
Tom is an archeologist.
Can you see my father?
I'm much older than you think I am.
I can't even lift this small box.
You can borrow an umbrella if you need one.
I immediately started crying.
That'll never happen again.
He assisted me with my business.
We didn't go to Boston.
Tom doesn't want to drive.
They ruined it.
Tom drew a picture of a squirrel.
I used to read three or four books a week.
I didn't know that you weren't Canadian.
Did you draw this yourself?
He has two cars.
I was caught in a shower on my way home.
He acts very shy in her presence.
I'm waiting for a very important call.
Tom is afraid of big dogs.
Tom was at school.
Eat more fruit.
Tom has three sons. One lives in Boston and the other two live in Chicago.
"Excuse me, where's the American Embassy?"
I want to know more about you.
I don't know anything about opera.
Tom did the same thing I did.
He became a policeman.
"You're really tall, aren't you?"
I have no money to buy the dictionary with.
Tom would be very pleased.
I've spent most of my life in Boston.
What did he tell you?
Please forgive me.
That white dress looks good on you.
Take the pan off the fire.
How much money did you save?
Tom always has a backup plan.
Tom could die.
Tom didn't know what Mary was making for dinner.
I met him on my way home from school.
The old house was demolished.
I wish we hadn't come to Boston.
Are all of them your friends?
I left my phone at home.
I love this sweater.
Your shirt is missing a button.
I was planning on telling you tomorrow.
"Hi, Tom. Come on in."
That's exactly what he wanted.
I don't get along with my stepfather.
Tom and Mary talked about everything they wanted to do on their upcoming vacation.
"You're impressed, aren't you?"
What kind of nonsense is that?
Tom needs to get himself out of there as fast as possible.
I'm so glad you've come.
I'm really happy with your decision.
Please don't ever do that again.
You can come if you want to.
Aren't you tired of me yet?
Tom is a selfish person.
Tell us a joke.
We loved one another.
Tom told the police everything.
Get your clothes on.
He was accused of stealing money.
Why don't you ask Tom yourself?
Tom was there with one of his friends.
What does the T stand for?
The soldiers had artillery.
It was hard at first.
Tom didn't seem to understand your explanation.
We study French together.
"Why don't you take a break, Tom?"
Let me know when you'll be ready.
Tom didn't want to see the results.
Tom said that Mary was in Boston now.
The fire started in Tom's room.
"Strictly speaking, a tomato is a fruit."
I'm not so brave.
Have you ever saved someone's life?
You didn't invite me.
He kissed her.
You speak so quietly I can barely hear you.
I would like to kiss you.
I knew you were going to do that.
How tall is Tom?
That's my pencil.
Tom has very little experience.
Tom was thirty.
What time do you usually get up on Saturday?
Do you think Tom knew that that was going to happen?
I'm not sure I like this plan.
I don't want this.
Which woman's son is sick?
Do we have a meeting this afternoon?
Tom told me about it.
Tom probably needs help.
I'm working alone.
I know who lives in this house.
You're almost as tall as Tom is.
Swear you won't do that again.
Tom very rarely cries.
Slow down. It's not a race.
Many of the people that need these drugs can't afford them.
How did you convince Tom to help you?
I had no idea you collected stamps.
The movie theater was empty.
I'll tell you later.
I'm not mad anymore.
My parents are asleep.
I met Tom.
Tom didn't buy Mary anything.
Why did you lie to us?
I was able to finish the work earlier than I had expected.
This is a love song.
I've got nothing to say.
Why are you following us?
I saw you with Tom last Monday.
I put it in the drawer.
Tom and Mary exchanged glances.
Did they have a backup plan?
"Unfortunately, it's not possible."
I think we should all go inside.
What does money mean to you?
That's so unlike you.
It's illegal to buy cocaine.
That's my specialty.
I know you think this is too expensive.
Tom crossed the road.
I just wanted to see you again.
What did you say his name was?
Get used to that.
Please tell me where Tom is.
Stop at the corner.
Tom is a dancer.
Pace yourself.
Does it snow a lot in the winter?
Could I have a word with Tom?
I hid behind the tree.
You should be proud of me.
Tom saw a large bird.
"I hate to interrupt you, but I need to say something."
You are strong-minded.
He doesn't heed any advice.
I let him sleep at my house for the night.
He doesn't understand what you say.
He went back to the store.
"Here, take this."
Bangladesh became independent in 1971.
Tom won't keep it.
Don't believe everything you hear.
Tom already knows what Mary needs to do.
You look tired.
I told Tom he should go to the dentist.
I know where you can find Tom.
I like your voice.
I think we should take Tom home.
He's stupid.
Do you know how to play chess?
We feel terrible.
I've studied French.
What do you think I was doing before?
Tom's life was spared.
You're young and strong.
I used to think like you.
"I'm glad you're happy, Tom."
Do you have it yet?
The rocket was launched into space.
You're way more experienced than me.
Where have you been lately?
What'll you do with it?
What are we paying for?
I'm just so tired.
Are you a member of the baseball team?
That's why you're still single.
Just leave it there.
They're pretty new.
Do you have a phone?
It's too hot.
I know I could've done that better.
I'll allow it.
Music is a big part of my life.
"Since it was Sunday, the store was closed."
It was an amazing trip.
Are you doing that on purpose?
I don't know how long I sat there.
It's instinct.
I'll do that if you show me how to.
The local coffee shop was replaced by a Starbucks.
This is happening way too fast.
We haven't yet decided what to do with it.
Tom's bicycle was stolen last week.
The population of China is 8 times that of Japan.
You're after me.
Will you come back tomorrow?
Tom said that you were hungry.
Tell Tom that I'll prune the trees.
Tom said that he didn't see Mary.
I have to escape.
Tom did an excellent job.
Here comes the hard part.
I didn't tell Tom that.
Will you buy it?
I went to Australia in 2013.
Tell me about it now.
I can't believe that people think Tom is intelligent.
I didn't know you were unhappy.
Tom will need it.
I'm just telling you the truth.
The boat was piloted safely into harbor.
Tom no longer lives in Boston.
He passed his property on to his son.
Let me know as soon as you're ready.
I think you should join us.
Tom sent Mary away.
I'm trying to work out this problem.
Mine is over there.
Tom's father left his family.
We're not eating.
I like coffee very much.
I'll call them tomorrow when I come back.
Are you still up?
You must be in love.
The noise startled Tom.
I know the reason that she quit her job.
Tom refused to shake my hand.
I hear a lot of girls wear bikinis at that beach.
You don't look too surprised.
Stop staring at me.
Is the party over?
I want to trust you.
What a smart idea!
There is a pen on the desk.
I don't like to wash dishes.
Which do you think is best?
What are the symptoms of mushroom poisoning?
It's so cold that the river has frozen over.
Tom wants to buy a fishing boat.
These are pens.
Don't make it worse.
This dog is shaggy.
I don't care.
Her behavior is my primary concern.
"I'm going to be asked to do that again, I'm sure."
Is this book yours?
Tom explained everything.
He turned the doorknob with his left hand.
Tom said he was exhausted.
We'll need more time.
I don't think it's right.
The United Nations General Assembly adopted the cease-fire resolution.
Tom gave a speech in French.
I'm looking forward to your reply.
Put this list in alphabetical order.
I'm not going to get up.
Can you print out this document for me?
I wish you hadn't told me that.
Will it be convenient for you to start work tomorrow?
Tom didn't play basketball.
Tom had no idea that Mary was a serial killer.
Nobody will force you to do that.
This is cute.
Did that surprise you?
I didn't know I needed a bodyguard.
Tom didn't know that I couldn't do what he was asking me to do.
I'd like you to see this.
"You don't believe Tom did that on purpose, do you?"
I want you to go with me.
"You were drunk, weren't you?"
I want to be an engineer.
During his administration a great many new laws were passed.
I don't know what to think anymore.
Start over.
No place is safe.
I dropped my earring.
Mary loves flowers.
Afghanistan is a landlocked country.
I know that you'll enjoy this movie.
Tom glanced at Mary.
Tom will be there tonight.
I'll never forget what you did.
Keep a bucket of water nearby.
I would never have agreed to do that.
It's a waste of time and money.
Both of my brothers are teacher.
Tom talked me into going.
Tom told Mary all about his childhood.
What's your favorite energy drink?
I thought you spoke French.
Can you solve these puzzles?
They blocked his proposal.
You have to learn the basics first.
Thank you very much for pointing that out.
I don't think I should trust Tom.
How many days will you stay in Boston?
"Since the bridge looks like a pair of glasses, they call it Meganebashi."
I'm brushing my hair.
I feel relieved.
Three bodies were found in the cave.
What do you mean?
Tom will listen to you.
Now stop crying.
What would you suggest?
I wasn't told.
"Tom is already an adult, isn't he?"
Tom believes everything I say.
Why did you buy so much?
Was this supposed to be funny?
This hat is a little too small for me.
I really miss Tom.
I thought you wouldn't like Boston.
Tom obviously doesn't want it.
I've already chosen.
Tom didn't seem to have a plan.
This isn't good news.
I don't know anyone who matches that description.
Come on any day you like.
Tom wasn't ready for it.
He needs a ladder.
Tom whipped Mary with his belt.
This is a fantastic place.
I just wanted people to like me.
Tomorrow's my day off.
There's no library in this town.
That's what Tom did.
I thought Mary was pretty.
I appreciate what you do for me.
You should apologize to Tom.
Is Tom kidding?
I'm doing this for you.
Quite a few people have been invited to celebrate the couple's anniversary.
He got a bad reputation.
The speed of light is much greater than that of sound.
You look a bit like Tom.
That country has natural resources.
They don't know me there.
What is your mother tongue?
Tom tried to warn Mary.
Leave whenever you want.
The boys have found a coin.
Was it a full moon or a new moon?
Tom drank some wine.
Tom is a lot better.
It's never going to happen again.
I apologized to Tom for that.
I came to wish you good luck.
Tom is going steady with Mary.
"At first, the Indians were friendly."
I don't want anything bad to happen.
Don't you like fish?
His dog follows him wherever he goes.
What a good idea!
I don't think Tom knows what movie you want to watch.
Don't count me out.
I hope you sing.
Who was that girl you were with at the beach today?
There's nothing more to say.
Tom said that he had found his keys.
The station is a three-minute walk from here.
"Tom doesn't like to use the term ""a person of color"" because he thinks it implies that white people have no color."
This is her book.
Mary's dress is too long.
Tom won't eat anything I cook for him.
He committed suicide.
"Many years later, the author added two more chapters to the novel."
I'm going to work.
Tom appeared to be bewildered.
Tom's achievements speak for themselves.
Tom told me that he was unlucky.
Don't misunderstand me.
I'm busy preparing for the next exam.
I think you'll like this book.
I shouldn't have left you alone.
Let us stop to think how much we depend upon atomic energy.
Do you want to tell me who they are?
The man was used to treating this kind of wound.
I was too happy to sleep.
He is afraid of getting lung cancer.
Tom doesn't flaunt his wealth.
Tom is a good kid.
I went fishing in the river.
I have poor eyesight.
Tom just sat there with his eyes closed.
Why did Tom have to go?
She is always smoking.
What did you do last summer?
Tom has been sick a long time.
I usually buy my clothes at the department store.
Come back within a month.
There is a crowd of women around Tom.
The bill will never go through.
I was just trying to do my job.
I'd better return this.
Brush your teeth after meals.
I like them both.
I thought you could help us.
This is only the beginning.
I did none of those things.
Tom didn't believe me.
I want to thank you.
Tom almost never agrees with me.
I have some French books.
It's made of brass.
Are you ready for the trip?
Tom didn't want Mary to help him.
Tom and Mary are my children.
I got it for free.
Do you really expect Tom to help you?
I wish that I hadn't gone to Australia.
We want to go to Australia.
I have a sister who plays tennis.
We're looking for a nice house to live in.
We're not together anymore.
What do you think of Japan's economy?
You have only to ask for it and it will be given to you.
He eats nothing else but fruit.
I don't think Tom will be in his office tomorrow morning.
Tom was surprised that Mary remembered what he'd said to her.
Learning a foreign language is hard work.
I doubt that Tom will cry.
Someone has stolen our clothes.
I saw it coming.
You have to decide that for yourself.
"I didn't know you were from Boston, too."
I will pick you up after work.
I thought that you said that Tom would do that.
Tom is Mary's gardener.
We're quite pleased with the result.
I'd like to have a little talk with you.
Tom hired Mary for the job.
I talked with him far into the night.
"Tom waited for Mary to speak, but she didn't."
I don't like dancing.
It's unbelievable.
Leave it to the professionals.
Tom will like this place.
That's not our policy.
"This time, you've crossed the line!"
This is the dictionary I told you about yesterday.
Why do we have to help you?
I've always hated you.
Let's leave it till tomorrow.
I know it sounds silly.
I'm sure we can depend on Tom.
I'm glad of that.
Tom felt a lump in his throat.
Tell Tom to do that later.
What do you want to see in Australia?
No one has been arrested.
That would be helpful.
I knew that I could do that.
That's a big sandwich.
I have just received a letter from a friend saying that she is coming to see me next week.
Basket weaving is a dying art.
Tom stole Mary's car.
"As long as you're here, you'd better take a bath."
Where will your party be?
Tom said the mosquitoes didn't bother him.
Tom knows a lot about you.
She said that she takes a shower every morning.
I have nothing against the proposal.
I'll call you as soon as I get home.
We didn't talk for years.
You were half right.
My older brother was the one who taught me how to drive.
You almost died.
"Tom, don't interrupt."
Ask my friends.
Tom was glad to hear Mary's voice.
I've had enough.
Tom had a bruise on his arm.
What would happen if I never brushed my teeth?
I didn't have breakfast this morning.
Tom is at home with the children.
Tom isn't telling you the whole truth.
My situation was different.
She's smart and beautiful.
I don't know why I was so nervous.
Tom was embarrassed.
I arrived in Tokyo at noon.
Tom is right behind you.
Tom has never lived in Australia.
Tom was married to Mary for three years.
I'm still thirsty.
The bus is slow.
Tom won't permit us to do that.
Tom fell in love with Mary.
You're making a big mistake.
You would've liked it.
I saw the boat sink.
Tom and Mary barricaded themselves in the room.
You're talking too fast.
I didn't know the exact procedure.
I don't work for you anymore.
Who are you writing to?
I know you're bluffing.
We still have many other things to discuss.
Tom teaches at Harvard.
She wants to extend the no-smoking area.
Come here.
I'll pay double.
I appreciate your directness.
"Every time I look at this picture, I think of my father."
That's why Tom left.
Tom can help you as well.
I like instrumental music.
Tom wants Mary to be safe.
I lost my watch yesterday.
Why did you leave?
You can leave if you want.
I hope you're well rested.
Tom is very curious.
God created the earth in six days.
I just got a promotion.
Tom has to do a bit of shopping.
I say that all the time.
She married an American GI after the war.
He plays the piano.
I don't think I'll ever do that.
When do you return home?
I'm not afraid of Tom.
I think I'll stay home today.
The old man is taking a walk in the park.
Drop your weapons!
Tom won't admit it.
Tom told me to get out of his room.
Tom was released for good behavior.
I'm a busy man.
I vowed that I'd never do that.
My handwriting is illegible.
How could Tom not know that was going to happen?
I revised my theory.
What does your father do for a living?
I don't believe we can do it.
I could've done that by myself.
I'm not living with Tom anymore.
We have to get as much information as possible.
Did Tom tell you that?
This coat doesn't have pockets.
"If there are mistakes, correct them."
Don't forget to take your medicine.
Tom snickered.
"At that time, Tom and I were in Boston."
She had her handbag stolen.
We'll get in touch with Tom.
We're so glad to have you here.
I won't stay with you.
People often say that Japanese is a difficult language.
"You aren't a spy, are you?"
You seem to be way too busy.
Whose side are you on?
Tom has even more books than I do.
Tom found what he wanted.
It's a thankless job.
Tom is singing.
Tom can't tell if Mary is serious or not.
She doesn't speak my language.
Do you drink?
"I'm sorry, I didn't hear you."
What're you looking at?
Maybe I can fix it.
Are you young?
The helicopter hovered over the building.
Tom wasn't a bad coach.
I told her to come visit us.
I didn't know that you used to live in Boston.
Turn up the volume.
I never drink wine.
Previously people believed the earth was flat.
You and Tom would make a perfect couple.
We know how it's going to end.
Do you think that Tom and Mary will get back together?
We have to be careful.
I wish I hadn't gone to Australia.
Is it safe to eat this?
Do you happen to know where Tom lives?
Tom motioned Mary to sit down.
How long have you been learning French?
I'll wait for you at the bar.
Tom knew what had to be done.
I told Tom to wear a tie.
Does anyone in your family play the piano?
No one was injured.
I promise I'll be there tomorrow.
This was part of the plan.
Tom went home.
Tom is only a child.
Have you changed your mind again?
I thought you said you couldn't speak French.
He stood up.
Empty the water out of the bucket.
I made this chair.
I usually eat outside.
That was a very kind act.
"You saw me, didn't you?"
Tom wanted revenge.
"If you visit Tom now, he'll probably be watching TV."
Tom and Mary laughed at me.
Tom is quite lucky.
You have an advantage over him.
We have less than two hours.
Who told you my name was Tom?
Don't make faces.
I'm angry with Tom for what he's done.
Have a seat.
Tom wrote poems about his love for Mary.
I don't like the people I work with.
She intended to become an actress.
I don't see much difference between them.
It had been snowing for a week.
Tom is a pro.
Didn't you know Tom saw you in the park this morning?
Tom was very talented.
How can I keep myself from snoring?
He was forced to sign the document.
How long are you going to be there?
I have neither time nor money.
You don't lie well.
You know what needs to be done.
This isn't a school. It's a hospital.
Tom knew why Mary was late.
Tom denied having said such a thing.
Tom is mad at you.
You were at my wedding.
I just got home.
I'm planning to visit Australia next year.
That isn't my car.
We all have responsibilities.
Haiti is a nation that seems hopelessly impoverished.
I can't wait to see Tom.
Tell me what you need.
Tom apologized to Mary for being so late.
You were behaving as if nothing had happened.
Bees fly from flower to flower.
There are people who think pineapples grow underground.
We hope it doesn't happen again.
What exactly do I have to do?
I asked myself why.
I have no reason to believe that Tom won't do what I asked him to do.
Tom got up early in the morning and swam.
Tom was lucky Mary wasn't there with him.
You'll never love me as much as I love you.
I want a full report before 2:30.
I didn't think you'd be here today.
You should visit Boston.
Tom seems incompetent.
Let's take up this matter after lunch.
Tom has left the room.
"You didn't cry, did you?"
You've told me that a hundred times.
I'm a minor.
I cannot release that information. It is private.
Tom said you were different.
I'm married to a Canadian.
Why isn't it working?
Tom stretched out on the couch and fell asleep.
Some people felt that Tom's behavior was inappropriate.
Tom was in a bad mood this morning.
How old are you now?
Tom says he isn't planning to go anywhere.
Aren't you going to introduce me?
Keep warm.
Tom also did that.
I don't answer stupid questions.
I know what you ate for lunch.
He underwent a risky operation.
He decided to seek information elsewhere.
I want to keep one.
Are you expecting Tom?
I was about to suggest the same thing.
You look smart.
It's extremely important that we speak to Tom.
Did you go to school?
Tom believes Mary is lying.
No arrests were made.
Tom married the most beautiful girl in the city.
I have a feeling you might want to see these.
"Like father, like son."
Tom isn't wrong.
I know that you can hear me.
All the apartments are occupied.
Do you know the man standing on the bridge?
The ham sandwiches were really good.
It is a very popular destination for tourists.
I wanted to stay home with my family.
My neighbor called the fire department.
Speak for yourself.
Tom doesn't know what love is.
Mary looks good in a black dress.
The submarine's periscope was sticking right out of the water.
Tom is learning how to fly a helicopter.
I worry about my future.
Tom is in an angry mood.
That's rubbish.
I burned the newspaper.
Her blue shoes go well with that dress.
What's your daughter's name?
I got up and walked out of the kitchen.
I disguised myself as a policeman.
He's a terrible driver.
You said we could go.
I put on my favorite dress for the party.
Everyone knows that we don't like each other.
Tom is eating cake.
They treated me like a criminal.
Is this store open on Sundays?
I won't do anything like that.
I thought you liked swimming.
Don't worry. It's perfectly safe.
Tom doesn't know I'm Mary's boyfriend.
I hope you don't drink too much.
When was the last time you went fishing?
Do you really trust Tom?
Are things OK with you?
I can't stay for long.
You don't have to follow my advice.
I can't do anything.
They applauded.
Did I hear you right?
I would like to meet his father.
The workman died from the explosion.
We hope Tom will do what we've asked.
We'll let Tom and Mary decide.
He felt severe pain in his back and legs.
I rechecked the data.
We don't know each other.
There's something I've been wanting to ask you.
I couldn't convince Tom.
I've already talked to Tom.
"Some people like summer, and others like winter."
Why do you resist?
I don't feel like going out for a walk.
Who notified you?
Stop being lazy and find something to do.
Tom is mad about you.
My parents want to meet you.
Tom did everything for Mary.
"At present, we have 1,600 students at our school."
There is no more cheese left.
I haven't said anything.
"Even though Tom just had his fortieth birthday, I don't think he's over the hill yet."
We need money.
We need information.
They forced me to take the medicine.
The Greek question mark looks like a semicolon.
Give the dog some water.
Can I kiss you again?
You don't have to go there.
Can I see you a second?
Tom had fun.
"Does she have a dog? ""No, she doesn't."""
I can't believe you're getting married.
I'm not sure I share your optimism.
Who will win?
The accident wasn't my fault.
"When I forgot my promise, he got really angry."
Drive cautiously.
Tom wanted to be at today's meeting.
The landlord says he wants to raise the rent.
Have you ever been married?
We could just leave it here.
Tom can't read all these books in one day.
I want to talk with my lawyer.
I need to change that bandage.
They carried him to a nearby house.
I couldn't do that either.
Will you lend me some money?
Have you finished your coffee?
What is your blood type?
The hotel where I'm staying doesn't have a parking lot.
You have no right to do this.
Why are people afraid of us?
Why aren't they here?
She was afraid to catch a cold.
How did you become so successful?
I couldn't have done anything without Tom's help.
He was right the first time.
Tom became concerned.
Tom told Mary to wash the dishes.
I'm ready to follow you.
I have a feeling that she'll come today.
Tell Tom that I'm exhausted.
Walk three blocks and then turn right.
Tom does that sometimes.
My chest hurts when I cough.
I own a computer.
I work at a language school.
"Give me a ride on your shoulders, Daddy."
I would like some more water.
Does Tom still want this?
Tom and Mary are reading the same book.
"Give me a call later, OK?"
There isn't a grain of truth in what he says.
I don't think that Tom is going to make it.
"Sooner or later, the truth'll come out."
When did you start studying French?
A lot of soldiers died here.
Have you asked the others?
I'm not your maid.
I don't care what you drink.
I came to thank you.
I'm not going to do that today.
I don't love Tom.
The men were all arrested.
Tom is worried about Mary's safety.
I did everything I was told to do.
I wish I'd thought of that.
Tom has recently become forgetful.
Can't you see that Tom needs your help?
Tom needs Mary.
Tom came yesterday.
My father fixes broken chairs.
Tom saw a snake slither across the path.
I didn't want Tom to worry.
I don't speak a word of French.
I'm using a new computer.
Things are only going to get worse.
I'd like to know why my name was deleted from the list.
I went to sleep.
My neighbor called the fire department.
Flying kites can be dangerous.
Tom is a hard person to please.
You are the one that I was looking for.
What did Tom stop for?
Tom said he had seen Mary a couple of months ago.
Tom decided to go abroad.
It's the best thing that ever happened to me.
Has Tom ever been to Australia?
Whose is this?
Tom asked for a wake-up call.
Tom has trouble reading.
"If I don't do it now, I never will."
Tom asked everybody to leave him alone.
Tom usually gets home before dark.
I don't think that Tom can wait.
It's hard for an old man to change his way of living.
You were there.
I fractured my arm.
I wanted Tom to come with me.
Canada borders the United States.
Nothing has been done yet.
He decided not to go.
How long will it take to you?
"Tom is mad at Mary, isn't he?"
Where did you get this key?
They sell imported goods at the shop.
Tom and Mary took turns with the driving.
I agree to your terms.
This city is famous for its beautiful park.
Did you know that rotten eggs float?
There's nothing any of us can do for Tom now except let him die with dignity.
You're wasting water.
I won't ask again.
"Tom didn't like it, but he still bought it."
I think Tom is thirty years old.
Maybe Tom could sing at your wedding.
He has a lot of land.
I enjoyed hanging out with Tom.
Tom is the only doctor in town.
Everyone knows that I don't like Tom.
Look after Tom.
Tom is just trying to confuse you.
Why were you on the roof?
Tom cried at Mary's funeral.
I found it there.
What's your favorite screen saver?
Tom said that Mary was engaged.
We are all eager to know the truth.
I had my shoes shined.
I almost left my umbrella in the train.
Tom handed a drink to Mary.
She shot him with a pistol.
I was already tired.
We're keeping an eye on them.
I watch TV every evening.
"At first, the Indians were friendly."
I'm tired.
I haven't been doing that as often as I should.
Raise your hand.
I know many women.
Tom almost never asks about that.
You're very brave.
She spread a cloth over the table.
Your father was right.
I was called on in English class.
I've got too much to do.
My staying here is out of the question.
I wrote a letter to Tom.
Why are we wasting time here?
We did that while you were asleep.
Should I talk to Tom?
"In general, things are all right."
One must follow the rules.
I'm sure Tom will come.
We'd like to run some tests.
I brought mine.
"Right now, I want to go to bed."
Tom has made his position clear.
I'm aware of that possibility.
Why didn't you kiss Tom?
I'm beginning to understand why you don't bother to try to explain things to Tom.
Tom is always complaining about his wife.
I really loved working here.
I know that things haven't been easy for you.
I must finish reading that book by tomorrow.
Why are you doing this?
It's a figure of speech.
Everyone believed you.
I'm glad you came today.
I've been expecting your call.
This system has obvious defects.
I wish you could go with me.
I have no idea who she is.
Some even accused him of treason.
I opened the blinds.
We have to discuss it.
I haven't painted the fence yet.
Where's Tom?
Which one would you recommend that I buy?
Tom corrected the error.
Tom called me names.
When will Tom go home?
I remember your father.
Are you no longer in pain?
We were eating pizza.
Rabbits are extremely social animals.
I speak a little French.
He was blazing with anger.
We're Tom's classmates.
It was quite cold.
You told her that you had finished the work three days ago.
I sure hope that that isn't true.
Take the next one.
I hope this answers your questions.
Tom likes to do things his own way.
I'm not sure that's possible.
Everyone needs to know this.
I'm here to have fun.
Is Tom going to be there?
"Above all, you must help each other."
They had started earlier than we had.
Tom said Mary would win and she did.
Tom fought in both world wars.
That room is not very large.
Who are these for?
Where did Tom get that much money?
Do you sell this by the kilogram?
Do you know what he did?
I don't know who you are.
It's not cheap.
Tom didn't want to continue the conversation.
"It's not a road, but a path."
It's hard to forget what happened.
Has Tom arrived?
The shoe doesn't fit me. It's too small.
Tom said you were witty.
You know perfectly well what I'm talking about.
They came in one by one.
I'm sure a lot of people would agree with you.
We're asking you not to do that.
"If I were you, I would follow his advice."
Do you think Tom will really help?
This is a very difficult language.
Blood is thicker than water.
I was given a ten percent discount.
I'm glad I invited you.
Candles were everywhere.
I don't like those kinds of jokes.
Tom'll succeed.
That was fabulous.
"When I got out of bed this morning, I had a headache."
You're charismatic.
You put far too much pepper in it.
Your textbook is on the floor.
Find Tom before he tells someone.
I tried to warn you.
We may have a very severe earthquake any moment now.
Tom hid the book under his pillow.
There's no way we'll get there in time.
Why don't you come over?
"She doesn't have a babysitter, so she can't go to the party."
Tom tried to convince Mary not to go.
Give me a hint.
I hope I can help you.
He can't come to the office today because he doesn't feel well.
Try to avoid junk food.
Tom could've killed you.
I can't believe that you like that restaurant.
You were unconscious.
Where did you buy this coat?
Do you think Tom would show me how to do that?
How often do you go there?
She returned quickly.
I'm meeting Tom at 2:30.
He is about to die.
Tom says that he needs to talk to you.
You're right about one thing.
I think Tom's grandmother is too old to wear a miniskirt.
This one's even better.
Let's have a ten-minute break.
Tom has agreed to wait.
Do as you want.
"If you don't want to know, don't ask."
Keep an eye on my bag while I buy a ticket.
Rome is in Italy.
I've always wanted to visit Boston.
You're driving me nuts.
Haven't you been listening?
Tom treats his employees generously.
Tom told me he was fine.
What activity do you spend most of your time doing?
The details really don't matter.
I don't think Tom knows whether to do that or not.
I used to play tennis with him on Sundays.
I like it when it's cold.
What are you trying to say?
I will show you around.
I took the elevator to the third floor.
I'll help you after work if I'm not too tired.
Have you ever missed a plane?
The stock market fell yesterday.
I want what you want.
Tom said that he liked skiing.
Do you have any idea how serious this is?
Do you really want Tom to leave?
I told Tom I didn't want to do that.
I like short hair.
"Last night, we had to call the police."
I'm glad you like Tom.
This question is too difficult for me to answer.
I knew you were hiding in the car.
Tom never would've done that.
"As far as I know, Tom hasn't left yet."
"The envious die, but envy never does."
I was hoping Tom would forget.
You had better ask the doctor for advice.
You missed the point entirely.
It'd be illegal.
Tom is very good.
I feel itchy everywhere.
He robbed me of every penny I had.
I don't want to go to school today.
What can they do to us?
Tom's room isn't very large.
How did you lose your arm?
I'm Tom's son.
My house is old and ugly.
What places would you like to visit?
Tom is always around.
Tom is on life support.
It cost three thousand dollars exactly.
Tom showed us his home.
It's just a bird.
Tom said he wanted to get divorced.
Do you know what UNESCO stands for?
Tom put a slice of bread into the toaster.
You're losing precious time.
Tom left his hat in my room.
I'm going to see you later.
Tom wants to go shopping with Mary.
This is a bad plan.
We'll talk soon.
Go get some water.
Nobody seems to know who did that.
They should've contacted us.
I thought that you said that Tom would do that.
Pay close attention to the details.
It's not a loan.
I hope Tom is more careful next time.
"Concerning this matter, I'm the one to blame."
Did Tom really leave?
Tom wouldn't eat what his mother put on the table.
"Unfortunately, she didn't come."
Who do you think will win the gold medal?
I want to hire Tom and Mary.
I'm not a robot.
They were so young.
Could you hold on a minute?
Didn't your parents teach you manners?
You need rest.
You're so kind.
Tom and Mary have been too busy fighting to notice how much they actually like each other.
We're sophomores.
Do you like red wine?
I didn't mean to do that.
I did what I was told.
She tossed me grapes and I tried to catch them with my mouth.
"You did this, didn't you?"
Did you find your key?
I have to disagree.
Tom didn't want to ask for help.
It's a very old book.
I struggled.
Try to understand.
"It's cool this morning, isn't it?"
"Some believed his story, and others did not."
It's been so many years.
I was one of the best students in the class.
Please send me a picture of yourself.
Perhaps it will snow tomorrow.
I know that you can swim.
"Wow, you're a lucky guy."
I'm going to take two days off next week.
Do we really want Tom to help us?
I want to write a letter.
We will be back at half past three.
Tom wants something more.
There's a telephone here.
Who is Tom to you?
There's no food.
I don't think anybody would want to see that movie more than once.
Stop picking on me.
He should be put in prison.
I don't know what to believe anymore.
When shall we have the party?
There's no need to hurry.
It was inevitable that they would meet.
I'll see if Tom's here.
I'm not sure I want to give this to Tom.
Tom may eat anything he wants.
I remember seeing her once.
"Are you OK, Tom?"
I'm not the one who hit Tom.
We all know what'll happen.
Check the calendar.
How many inches are in a foot?
My glasses are broken.
Where are the guards?
Who are you to talk to me like that?
I haven't yet watered the flowers.
Tom said that I had to go.
Can you teach me how to play that song?
Why don't you buy both of them?
You're being very unfair to me.
I'll be home all afternoon.
The store is close to my house.
The zipper is stuck.
I didn't murder anyone.
I have a tattoo of a dragon on my chest.
I don't understand this word.
It seems that Tom isn't here today.
Drink it down.
Write it in pencil.
I wish I hadn't spent so much money.
Tom will need our support.
Have you ever tried doing it this way before?
I want to sleep a little more.
This book deals with anthropology.
What are you going to do about this?
I know you have homework to do.
I never saw his face.
Tom has two brothers who live in Boston.
Tom fired me.
He collected bits of information.
Have I already told you this?
He doesn't care about anything.
You see what I mean?
Her cheeks turned red.
I never told anyone about what happened.
Who told you Tom broke his leg?
He told me that his father was a teacher.
I got quite a scare when they said you were in the hospital.
Tom was a comedian.
When did you leave?
"Unless you make a decision quickly, the opportunity will be lost."
My dream has come true.
He was able to reduce taxes.
"Oh my God, you're drunk."
You're just sad.
We knew that.
Tom was found strangled in his apartment.
Tom waited.
I haven't finished reading the report.
Tom was really drunk last night.
I'll send you the bill.
Do we really want Tom to do that?
Tom spends most of his free time watching TV.
I'd like to study in Paris.
It's time to reflect on your past.
He listened to the music with his eyes closed.
Is Tom allergic to peanuts?
Tomorrow is a big day.
Tom told me that he would rather not go.
He can't be ill.
Get a life!
Brace yourselves for impact.
Tom remembered where Mary had told him to go.
We love them.
Tom felt his knees tremble.
The police are there.
He is a man of noble birth.
Tom can play the drums.
Do you think Tom will buy it?
We didn't have enough time to finish the job.
You'll never guess who I just met.
Tom let out a belch.
We want to help.
I don't want to think about it anymore.
Tom came about 2:30.
You'll have to learn to cook.
It isn't safe to swim in that river.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Endorse this check.
Can you repair it?
The doctor advised me to lose weight.
Tom shouldn't have left.
Didn't you know Mary was Tom's sister?
Please come inside.
Has anyone done that?
The situation is extremely critical.
I know that he's Tom.
We're all sorry.
Are you telling us the truth?
I don't want to go anywhere.
The North Star is very easy to find.
Give me what you have in your hand.
Children like fruit juice.
That fear isn't unfounded.
Are you blaming me?
Tom reminded Mary of John.
You've got to get rid of it.
I really liked his style of singing.
I feel I've already won.
Tom is going to stay with us.
I like to travel by myself.
We're coming back tomorrow.
I knew they would suspect you.
I didn't know Tom.
I know you live here.
Tom was kind to me.
Tom's eyesight is really bad.
I deny everything.
You're acting like an idiot.
My grandmother suffers from osteoporosis.
Who stopped?
Tom taught me everything.
Tom and Mary got married.
I can't believe I won.
He hated lying.
"Early in July, they got the news."
"You drink milk, don't you?"
I was thinking.
Tom seemed to want to say something.
Am I really that bad?
Can I talk to you about Tom?
Tom has three cars.
I do not understand you.
I think the box has something in it.
We'll help you find it.
Tom was just lucky.
I just wanted you to help me.
Let's get down to work.
"You used to like me, didn't you?"
We were all stunned.
I don't know who to trust anymore.
"I hope so, too."
Tom has been living here since 2013.
Don't blame yourself.
Maybe I should ask Tom.
You've never told me that before.
Tom doesn't want to live in the city.
I saved you.
I used to do that when I was a kid.
Second semester has ended.
Don't forget your ticket.
I used to keep a diary in English when I was a student.
I think you know we have to do that.
I liked your comment.
"I borrowed 1,000 yen from my cousin."
Many thanks.
"May I come tomorrow, too?"
Tom will pay for it one day.
Do you know where Tom's keys are?
Many Americans did not have jobs.
"If you could have three wishes, what would they be?"
Tom killed himself in Boston.
Aren't you two hungry?
Why don't we all sit down?
"If I were in your situation, I would do the same thing."
Tom doesn't want to wait for you.
"If you hurt her, I'll kill you."
I feel so happy today.
"You've painted the walls, haven't you?"
Tom will try doing that.
That's not mine. It's my wife's.
How many people did you invite?
I just wanted to be left alone.
Her dream has come true.
I did what you asked.
You're stubborn.
I opened a bottle of red wine.
Tom didn't know what kind of snake had bitten him.
I have as many books as Tom does.
You should go on a diet.
The agitators instigated the rebellion.
"Tom started to say something, but Mary interrupted him."
Tom's answer is wrong.
They smiled at Tom.
Where's Tom going to live?
Let me in. I have to talk to you.
"I grabbed my little sister's hand, and the two of us started running."
I'll take one.
Tom barely studied for the exam.
I only read the first three chapters.
Tom has already told me what you plan to do.
There's reason to celebrate.
Just who do you think you are?
It was eight meters long.
I think I forgot to tell Tom that.
This CD belongs to him.
Tom is about the same weight as Mary.
We should get married.
Tom wants to drink champagne.
How did Tom know that that would happen?
The water is cold.
I don't care who you are.
That was my lunch.
Tom put out his cigarette.
I'm tired of listening to you.
Tom is going to forgive you.
I replied automatically when I heard my name.
Who invited you here?
How safe is this part of town?
Wash the apple before you eat it.
Write it in pencil.
He missed the train because of the traffic accident.
Trust me.
Tom said that he didn't have insurance.
Are you coming to the concert with me?
Tom says he's given it a lot of thought.
I'd like to discuss something with you.
It's time for you to go to bed.
Why were you looking for us?
Haven't I told you everything already?
Please tell me how to do this.
She'll make a good wife.
What a fool I was!
Should I feel bad?
Tom visited the National Museum when he was in Amsterdam.
Is Tom in your class?
Everybody ran outside.
Those things happen sometimes.
Tom says he won't cry.
I never yell at Tom.
He won a gold medal.
Tom never asked me.
Tom had no idea what to say.
I can do everything myself.
Tom donated three paintings to the museum.
I'm sure Tom was happy.
The road is blocked.
I don't think I can fix it.
I bet you know this.
You know very well what I'm talking about.
Tom is good at basketball.
She was the first one to pay attention to him.
It's fun to travel.
It's almost ready.
He is very honest.
Is this the bus to Oxford?
It cost an arm and a leg.
Wow! Look at him eat!
Remember that you aren't alone.
I'm not going to talk to you anymore.
Do you want to be famous?
Give me a little time to think it over.
This is my older brother.
I was on the phone.
Do you like this purse?
Tom poured some olive oil on the salad.
I didn't order fish.
Do those insects sting?
I wish you were wrong.
I'm so tired!
Are those your sons?
You've got to get rid of this.
I'm going back for Tom.
Tom will be so pleased.
I'm talking about Tom.
Let's forget about this.
I didn't know that Tom had been sick.
"Real men go to the gym to pump iron, not to do aerobics."
Who's the next person on your list?
Tom lives with his father in Boston.
I've gone to Australia twice.
Tell Tom that I'm sorry.
Tom is busy today.
Their second album is much better than their first album.
Yesterday I arrived in Tokyo.
I don't want to see him at all.
Tom died in prison.
Tom has undeniable talent.
Please show me another one.
She lives alone.
The little boy is being spoiled by his grandmother.
The second lesson is very simple.
Those boxes are empty.
Why are you telling me all of this?
We're snowed under by invitations.
Don't use this until tomorrow.
Tom is making cookies.
Have you seen my phone?
I said yes.
Tom must be out of money again.
Don't worry about me.
I don't think that I know anyone in Boston.
We need an electrical engineer for this job.
Tom shares an apartment with three friends.
Tom entered the building through an unlocked window.
They are taking a walk.
I did everything I was supposed to do.
Tom lives a floor up from me.
Don't give up. You still have a chance.
Tom is interested in Australian history.
When does your summer vacation end?
I don't know which one I want.
We love Tom dearly.
I'm being fired.
Tom didn't answer our questions.
That man looks familiar.
He asked me if I had slept well the night before.
I managed to get to the station on time.
I come from a humble background.
"If you study hard, you'll pass the exam."
Tom Jackson is the head of our department.
Tom may have walked Mary home last night.
I'm going to take an umbrella with me.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Guess what Tom said.
Both children were punished.
Tom told me that he was next.
I know an English language instructor who comes from Canada.
I don't see what else we can do.
I will have him repair this watch.
I was afraid because it was very dark.
Tom stole your ring.
How many years have you been married?
The moon was full.
Do you really like doing that?
I want to warn you.
Tom and I are early.
Do it gently.
My sister is having a baby in June.
Pets are permitted.
It looks like we'd better leave.
Why did Tom decide to quit his job?
What are you two doing in here?
The server is down.
This book is small.
Why does Tom hate you?
I don't think that I can fix it.
Whose son is Tom?
I'm not as young as Tom is.
It's time for a change.
Tom has to help Mary.
Don't ever do that again.
Where did you learn this?
"I wonder if it's stopped raining. ""I hope so."""
Aren't you a taxi driver?
When's your first class?
What're you trying to do?
My heart was filled with sorrow.
I understood everything that you said to me.
I stepped in the mud.
We just don't have enough time.
Did you tell Tom why you're here?
Tom has advised me not to stop doing that.
I asked her if I could read the book.
"These are hard times, I know."
I wish I hadn't done that.
Tom wouldn't eat.
When is the party?
How much milk did you buy?
"Tom is a wonderful person, isn't he?"
I want to show you what Tom gave me.
Please forgive me for opening your letter by mistake.
Many foreign language students dream of speaking like a native.
He is still here.
I'm still young.
"When she was a student, she went to the disco only once."
Your kiss is sweeter than honey.
"The next day, Isabela came back home."
How was your first night in Boston?
It's no secret that Tom doesn't agree with you.
I'm really starting to hate Australia.
I don't think that's necessary yet.
Is it the vacuum cleaner's fault that the room is dusty?
Do you believe global warming is the result of human actions?
I turned off my phone.
Tom tried to predict the future.
Please limit your presentation to 30 minutes.
I'd like to discuss something with you.
Tom got Mary a glass of water.
Are you sure you aren't cold?
I start work at eight in the morning.
I haven't seen you for a long time. Come and see me once in a while.
That's a pretty difficult question.
They didn't see us.
We're unlucky.
I know you'll never forgive Tom.
Where in Australia did you grow up?
I can't do any better.
We hope Tom doesn't win.
You can go home if you like.
You're a liar.
Get a haircut.
Do you know how I can get in touch with Tom?
The scar isn't really visible.
Why do you come here?
Tom and Mary think I don't know.
"The more I know him, the more I like him."
French isn't my native language.
I don't think that it's a trick.
You're not studying hard enough.
Do you not like wine?
"You think I'm stupid, don't you?"
Let me help you do that.
I can do whatever I want.
Tom is watching the evening news.
Existing legislation does not take diversity of races into account.
Tom is about the same age as you.
Tom has red hair.
Tom needs to be told not to do that again.
"Tom threw rocks at Mary's window in the middle of the night to get her attention, but he ended up breaking her window instead and Mary's father called the cops."
What is her problem?
Don't act like you know me.
Tom skipped lunch.
Tom had never seen anything like this before.
Did I give it to you?
He had the boldness to ignore my advice.
I really need your help.
Who gave you that package?
She whispered something to him.
"When you love what you do, it shows."
The temperature's fallen below zero.
Do you want me to go now?
I suggest that you go and see a doctor about this as soon as you can.
Did you bring your family with you?
"My sister was on a diet for a week, but gave up."
Tom has been expecting Mary.
Help me print this.
We've got some questions for you.
May I bother you for a moment?
Tom said he didn't like to do that.
I thought you said you used to live in Boston.
Tom must have spent a fortune.
My cat is running around the room.
You aren't supposed to be here.
I know that Tom is very talkative.
We drove all night.
I don't understand either.
I took a shortcut.
Tell me who'll do that.
I was in the hospital last week.
Tom paid the bill and pocketed the change.
I'm sure you deserved it.
This film is a masterpiece.
Tom has already started to do that.
How do you prove that?
I'm not going to apologize.
Tom isn't allowed to go there.
Did you read everything?
I heard you tell Tom not to sing.
Is her hair naturally red?
Is that the car you told me about?
I bought a new sewing machine.
Do you want to switch seats?
She needs you.
Where did you and Tom go?
Why does Tom hate dogs so much?
Have you talked to Tom's parents?
They want to make it bigger.
Tom drank from my cup.
Do you live here?
I know both of Tom's sisters.
I know you've been waiting for this.
I'm ashamed of my past.
I wanted Tom to suffer.
She stared at the man in silent astonishment.
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
My lips often get chapped in the winter.
I paused.
The car he was riding crashed into a train.
It costs an arm and a leg.
Dreams come true.
Didn't you know that peanuts aren't really nuts?
Do you want me to leave the light on?
My two-year-old won't eat some of the healthy food I've been trying to feed him.
Why aren't you laughing?
I've got time.
Tom gets up early in the morning.
There's room inside.
Can I do something for you?
They all tried to talk at one time.
I like both dogs and cats.
I suppose we should ask Tom.
We'll talk tonight.
You've never done that kind of thing before.
Is Tom dying?
Tom is a music critic.
I suspect you're right.
Let's hear your excuse.
There's clearly a problem.
I'm not there yet.
I choose what I buy carefully.
Tom made a strategic error.
Who looks after this dog?
Tom moved into his new apartment on October 20th.
Tom is happy to be here.
I'm not Tom.
"Ever since Tom changed his mother-in-law's light bulbs, he's been in her good books."
Tom's new wife is young enough to be his daughter.
I don't want to kiss Tom.
I saw Tom pick it up and put it in his pocket.
Tom lives in a very large house.
Tom got lost on his way here.
Everybody's looking at me.
I feel safe with you.
I don't understand what you are talking about.
Who forced Tom to sing?
You're very observant.
Tom died from tuberculosis.
I'm 30 years old now.
Do you like this color?
Why are you still angry at me?
Ask Tom where he went last Monday.
Is your mother still living?
I don't know anything about cars.
I'll quit doing that.
You're standing in my way.
Should I let Tom go?
I'd like to believe you're right.
I think you know that's not a good idea.
He's sitting in the waiting room.
You keep forgetting to pay the bills.
You were delirious.
I'm afraid Tom doesn't want to talk to you.
The bathtub overflowed while she was talking on the phone.
He earns more money than he can spend.
I am eighteen years old.
We're already three weeks behind schedule.
No one knows you're my cousin.
I won't let anyone push me around.
What are you saying?
She hit the ball hard.
Who are you all?
Have you ever killed someone?
Tom didn't have time to think.
I'm so excited.
Tom looks very content.
The chicken is undercooked.
I must go.
You're invited.
"In America, cars drive on the right side of the road."
The audience exploded with laughter.
Tom said you told him to wait.
Thanks for pointing that out to me.
Our lives are in your hands.
Did I ask your opinion?
We've been abandoned.
Tom had a black eye.
You would be safe there.
I'm one of the dancers.
My advice is not to tell Tom.
"We'll have to do that, too."
The last time I saw Tom he was wearing a suit.
Did you think I'd really drink that?
It's up to you.
Tom is mad at you for lying to him.
What should I do today?
Didn't you know Tom was Mary's brother?
Tom is my grandfather.
I take a bath every morning in the summer.
Tom gave Mary some money to help her buy her mother a Christmas present.
Do you think Tom is wealthy?
"Tom looks a lot like John, doesn't he?"
I didn't know you wanted to learn French.
I wish that I hadn't eaten so much.
He's a good lad.
You said you'd get something to eat.
Tom forgot his key.
Words cannot describe it.
Let's start with this.
Have you talked to Tom yet?
I thought that you said that you didn't want to do that.
Tom just called Mary a hippie.
Can you translate?
They're Christians.
May I join you?
Tom painted the wall green.
Tom has done everything wrong.
Who are you to tell me what to do?
Neither Tom nor Mary did that.
Do exactly as I say.
Are you sure Tom's going to be there?
Tom is going to lend me his French textbook.
I know that Tom will be back soon.
I'm not sure that I want Tom working for us.
I already know your secret.
Did you go bowling yesterday?
When and where shall we meet?
Tom nodded his head in thanks.
She grows many kinds of flowers.
"You're one of Tom's friends, aren't you?"
She never stays long.
It isn't a threat.
Don't blame Tom for what happened.
I've forgiven you.
We have to talk to Tom.
Can you suggest something else?
Tom and Mary are in danger.
Is this your first time in Australia?
Tom's feelings were not reciprocated.
"Tell Tom that I want to go, too."
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
I waited more than three hours.
I don't eat apple cores.
We work from nine to five.
Tom doesn't usually wear a tie.
Tom has lost his watch.
We couldn't do that.
I don't want to go back to school. I wish summer vacation would never end.
I'll send the book by mail.
I gathered more information about it.
Can't they do anything?
Is it a good investment?
I'm bleeding.
Have you seen my wife?
I'm going to take off this stamp with hot water.
I'm sure you can do that.
"You can do it, Tom."
I simply don't believe you.
You have a good lawyer.
Would you like to join us?
We're all Canadians.
We should head home.
How much cash do you carry?
How much did they charge you for that?
Please stay with me a while longer.
Will you come with us?
I'll go with you.
Tom told me I had to do that.
The children called Tom a mama's boy.
Neither Tom nor Mary has a car.
"I accept, but only under one condition."
I helped Tom even though I was busy.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
Hold your horses.
The house is burning.
I don't have much time now.
I've had the same problem myself.
What newspaper do you subscribe to?
Are you lost?
Where can I exchange yen for dollars?
This word has a double meaning.
Tom was trembling.
Are you sure Tom left?
I thought the meeting had been canceled.
Let us know when you'll arrive.
Isn't that enough for you?
It is second-hand.
I think you're ready.
I didn't know you were upset.
Tom can help us do that next week.
I was a fool to trust you.
I woke up at 6:30.
Didn't you know Mary was Tom's grandmother?
I didn't know your father had passed away.
We're free!
How many televisions does Tom have?
I'm not certain that Tom likes that.
Our products sell well overseas.
Let me rephrase it.
I'm not accustomed to eating this sort of food.
I was puzzled about what to do next.
You can't see the forest for the trees.
The tip of the spear was dipped in a deadly poison.
I didn't know it at the time.
You must be careful not to make him angry.
That's a fairly reasonable price.
I've lost my patience with Tom.
Just pick one.
I'm not as skinny as I used to be.
I told Tom never to do that again.
Which branch of the armed forces were you in?
I've forgotten your last name.
I sent a message to you.
Don't ever wear that tie again.
Try it for yourself.
This is the dictionary I told you about yesterday.
Why did Tom call you?
I think you need some sleep.
I think it's very dangerous.
The house Tom built is wonderful.
I don't like my work.
I know now.
What did you see last night?
Tom doesn't look very much like his father.
I woke up too late.
Queen Elizabeth died in 1603.
I've never done this.
I think it's time for me to clean the garage.
I really should leave.
Tom hired Mary immediately.
Do you like pork?
"Look, I have to go."
Everybody laughed at my idea.
Are we in trouble?
Mary isn't my wife.
Did you do yesterday's homework?
Tom said he paid thirty dollars for this book.
Tom won't be going with me.
How much time do you spend on Facebook?
I'll never leave Boston.
Money doesn't grow on trees.
The note was from Tom.
Where will you be on October 20th?
What should we do?
Can you tell me what you're talking about?
Tom started working.
Who are we talking about?
It doesn't give me any satisfaction to prove you wrong.
Tom decided not to smoke anymore.
What time do you go to the market?
I certainly agree.
There was nothing Tom could do.
I want very much for you to understand.
I'll come tomorrow morning.
Which car is ours?
I went home in order to change my clothes.
The teenager smashed the car into a tree while fleeing from the police.
Everybody is laughing.
Tom made it very clear that he didn't want us here.
I know what this is.
There's no need to hurry.
Give me another one.
Are you ambitious?
I know what we should do.
Didn't you know Tom didn't have a driver's license?
I have a lot of dreams.
Tom and I talked about the war.
Tom is three years younger than Mary is.
I'm not allowed to go outside.
Everybody does that.
I heard that Tom was gunned down.
Only do what Tom tells you.
Why did you kiss me?
Tom is trustworthy.
Follow your instincts.
What did you do this week?
Do you want me to wait here?
The boat was equipped with radar.
Those were the saddest hours of my life.
I wasn't expecting Tom to be there.
What time did you leave?
Where did Tom find this ring?
Hello!
I think we've learned a lot.
You may go there.
This is my car.
I used to work in a noisy room.
I met Tom on my way to school this morning.
Didn't you know that Tom used to live Boston?
It cost about three hundred dollars.
With whom do I have the honor of speaking?
You look nervous.
Tom is taller than his brother.
The rest will be easy.
Tom has tiny hands.
Tom will find out the truth.
I think I'll go to Australia with Tom.
I failed the exam.
Bring me my cane.
I need to know more about you.
This laptop computer is very thin.
"If I remember correctly, Tom's birthday is October 20th."
Tom hurt his left leg.
"Not having dealt with such a problem, they don't know what to do."
He works a lot.
The village is connected with our town by a bridge.
I suggest we all calm down.
Tom found the information he was looking for online.
We spent the entire day in Yoyogi Park.
Don't you want to see your kids?
Tom told me he was unafraid.
She has red spots all over her body.
Do you want to go fishing tomorrow?
I can't deal with Tom anymore.
When did you tell me that?
You never asked why.
I'm leaving tonight.
Don't tell Tom. I don't want to worry him.
She can't live without him.
I'm sure you're very busy.
"No, I didn't write it."
People will talk.
Tom moved out of his parents' house.
Everybody wants to be liked.
I have a bad sunburn.
Tom lost his only son in a car accident.
I can help Tom.
I'm not sure I want that.
I definitely didn't want to do that.
Let's just get it done.
This hat is yours.
I hate lawyers.
The flowers have all withered.
I'm analytical.
Will you buy it?
"All at once, something happened."
I don't think you should borrow money from Tom.
"It was hot yesterday, wasn't it?"
I'm going to need a sponge.
They met in prison.
I'm thirteen.
I wanted to make some telephone calls.
I don't think that Tom has time to talk to you now.
What time is it now by your watch?
Do you know the names of all eight of your great-grandparents?
I'm sure that I'm right.
What would've happened to me if I hadn't done that?
I expected better of him.
Today's meeting is very important.
Please bring the others.
I've been waiting for you to say that.
He looked through a magazine.
Tom wrote this book.
Tom told me you needed some money.
I won't fail this time.
It was a warm day.
Tom didn't have any idea what he should do.
Are you sure you don't want this?
The novel was published after his death.
Give me your telephone number.
My parents also have a farm.
This is absurd.
He refuses to listen to me.
Who found my missing book?
I'd like to try.
You need to stick to a diet.
Are you sick of me?
I finished third.
This is what Tom feared.
"I agree with Tom, too."
Tom wouldn't give me a chance to think.
Did you know that some foxes lived on this mountain?
That foreigner spoke Japanese as if it were his native language.
Good luck with the new job.
I'm committed.
Tom said that he had a wonderful time.
Tom told me not to tell Mary where I lived.
Let me talk with Tom.
Tom doesn't like cheese.
Maybe you shouldn't go with Tom.
There will be other opportunities.
Tom gave me this ring.
Do you know why Tom doesn't like Mary?
I've already told Tom that I need to do that.
The best way to know a foreign country is to go there yourself.
Tom is a screenwriter.
I agreed to have dinner with Tom.
He fell asleep right away.
I hear you're studying French with Tom.
The Nile is the longest river in the world.
It's rude of you to ask her that question.
Are you happy now?
What time of year do you usually like to spend time on the beach?
I want something to drink.
Tom is a big eater.
I'm convinced Tom had nothing to do with what happened.
This is the key that opens that door.
Who gave it to you?
Why are dogs easier to train than cats?
I thought you could speak French.
I'm adventurous.
The radio doesn't work.
I've thought a lot about it.
She forced me to do it.
You need to call me.
"Where's your girlfriend, Tom?"
I dropped the cup.
Tom's first wife was really strange.
I wouldn't bank on it if I were you.
Tom is rich.
What do your children usually eat for breakfast?
What did Tom want me to do?
The door remained closed.
That's the house where Tom was born.
Wake Tom up.
Tom is out for a walk.
Tom walked into the kitchen with a fly swatter in his right hand.
I had forgotten how beautiful you are.
How many aspirin did you take?
I thought Tom would want this one.
That is what this is about.
Is everybody ready?
Tom really played well.
I'll get there at about 2:30.
"Mary resembles her mother in appearance, but not in character."
Tom is setting the table.
You're always busy.
That joke was funny.
Let me show you my new apartment.
Did you drink tea yesterday?
I won't tell anyone about Tom.
Finish your work.
Tom doesn't speak to Mary.
"Tom isn't still sleeping, is he?"
We'd like to look at some engagement rings.
Tom doesn't have a home.
"I know Tom is a friend of yours, but I still don't like him."
What kind of gifts did you get?
Exactly how much money did you lose?
"As far as I can tell, Tom's French is pretty good."
I just never noticed it before.
How long have you been here?
Tom told me that Mary did that wrong.
We don't want you to die.
Do you think Tom will succeed?
Were you forced to do that?
I said I'd think about it.
I'm practicing judo.
She's eating an apple.
What floor is your office on?
Why did Tom want two copies?
I don't want to disturb Tom.
I know I made a mistake.
Why don't you ask Tom yourself?
This upsets me.
I don't understand it.
This one is even better.
We need paper.
Tom was excited to go to the concert.
We shouldn't have done that.
I'm traveling by myself.
Give me time.
Mary wants to buy a dress.
"No, I don't speak French."
He went to London in 1970.
Tom is too proud to ask for help.
Look in the phone book.
I was afraid I might fall asleep while driving.
We stayed at home because it was very cold.
The only fingerprints that the police found on the doorknob were Tom's.
You are wearing your shirt inside out.
Do you think that I'm handsome?
The drinks are half price until six.
What do you think it means?
I never spend a day without thinking of you.
We stayed home because it was raining.
Do you know Tom's password?
Who did you talk to?
This tea tastes good.
That isn't acceptable to Tom.
Those people are dangerous.
Tom wasn't happy about this.
You promised me you'd talk to Tom.
Tom showed me a picture of Mary.
I don't think that Tom knows anybody who can do that.
I haven't the faintest idea.
She took the case into court.
Tom is drawing something.
The weather's been great.
That's Tom's watch.
I hope you're not making a mistake.
Would you mind taking your shoes off?
"Many of you speak French, right?"
I'm sorry to bother you so often.
I was a bit embarrassed.
Walking in the moonlight is a romantic way to end a date.
Didn't he tell you who he was?
Tell Tom you're not ready.
What was the weather like when you went out this morning?
He's in the money.
It was partly my fault.
"Tom, I have something to say to you."
"Tom is Mary's grandson, isn't he?"
You're half an hour late.
Nobody knows what goes on behind those doors.
The job will take a minimum of ten days.
Does free will exist?
I wanted to sit next to Tom.
Tom shouldn't have said anything.
Tom wanted you to have this.
"I'm a tourist, too."
Do you want my help or not?
They can afford it.
"OK, you win."
Tom behaved very badly.
She had no difficulty in learning the poem by heart.
Is it OK not to do that?
"Tom called me, too."
Tom was eager to get started.
Tom told me he was thirty.
Tom didn't tell me where he went.
I'm feeling nauseous.
Tom has no idea how to do that.
You said that you were planning on going with us.
I wouldn't be surprised if that happened.
I won't go away.
It's been a long time since I've worn a tie.
Tom hates his parents.
Tell everybody.
This time is different.
I have to talk to you alone.
I don't know anything about Tom at all.
Tom knew all that.
Tom bought Mary something.
This seemed impossible.
They didn't seem to understand French.
I heard my phone ring once.
I'm not your commanding officer.
Everybody wants one.
I must tell you the truth.
You're the one I need now.
You know that that's not true.
We can't publish this story.
Somebody left a package here for you.
Stop talking about that.
Give me some beer.
Tom has known Mary since childhood.
Tom lifted up his shirt and exposed his belly.
I have to go. It's getting late.
Didn't you know I used to teach French in Boston?
I thought I was going to have a heart attack.
Tell me about your children.
Everything I've told you should be kept secret.
You should have spoken more politely.
What do you know about what happened?
What're you talking about?
Tom lived here three years ago.
Why are we listening to this?
Take mine.
What have you decided?
I won't stay here alone.
Take the elevator to the fifth floor.
Who told you that Tom and I are dating?
What you said left a deep impression on me.
I can't understand why Tom refused to help us.
Could we speak to Tom?
How did you find out where I live?
"Tom's very resilient and can always manage to smile, no matter what's going on in his life."
Maybe he did it on purpose.
The hat is yours.
Tom showed the letter to me.
Tom had no idea what had happened.
A bee flew out of the window.
What do you think will happen next?
Tom and I are partners.
Tell me about yourself.
You have changed a lot.
I didn't know Tom was so lonely.
Are you the one who wrote this?
I don't have it with me.
They are gathering nuts.
No one understood.
I disagree.
I think Tom doesn't want to tell us the truth.
Tom is about the same weight as you.
Do you think you'll be happy here?
The suit's made of very rough material.
He flew to New York on business.
Tom is impressed as well.
Tom told me to stay at home.
Have you ever dug a hole as deep as this one?
I need you to stay here.
He counts fast.
Why are you running?
He likes all animals except horses.
Tom isn't very fussy.
I called Tom last night around midnight.
Tom needs help.
I need a few people to help me.
"Take it, please."
Two gentlemen have been waiting to see you.
Please cut my hair.
Who let Tom in?
They believe you.
It's unlikely Tom will win.
That was of great help to me.
Tom showed Mary the paper.
There's no question about Tom's loyalty.
We'll have to do something about that.
You never told me you were married.
The new museum is worth visiting.
Marriages are made in heaven.
Everybody should vote.
What are your plans?
Please come back home as soon as you can.
"The bus stopped, but nobody got off."
Thousands of families were left homeless.
I can't live alone.
You don't need to apologize to Tom.
I fed some meat to my dog.
It's been thirty years since we got married.
I thought Tom would be pleased.
Why are you pretending you don't know me?
You look tense.
Tom told me that he was divorced.
Why didn't you tell me you were sick?
"Well, I really must go."
We must develop renewable energy sources.
Tom has broad shoulders.
He told me the story of his life.
Young people are usually full of energy.
Everything is broken.
The village is now different from what it used to be.
I am sneezing.
Don't write in ink.
What do you need so much money for?
Do you think it'll rain?
We're deluding ourselves.
I helped carry those bags.
Eggs are getting more expensive.
"Once you start smoking, it is difficult to get rid of that bad habit."
It was difficult for me to find the entrance to that building.
His face turned pale.
I work at an embassy.
The lighting blinded me for a while.
I wonder what made Tom think Mary wanted to do that?
Tom showed his driver's license to the policeman.
We carried a map with us in case we should lose our way.
We've known each other for three years.
"If you don't like it, don't eat it."
What does USSR stand for?
The place was empty inside.
Don't respond.
A bear will not touch a dead body.
It doesn't matter whether you win or not.
Everyone has their own point of view.
You seem busy.
How did that get in there?
I work at my friend's shop.
I demand you give me my money back.
Things changed after that.
I haven't yet eaten anything today.
I knew you'd been studying French.
I prefer dogs.
This is a small token of my gratitude.
I know you wouldn't do that.
I admit that I made a mistake.
We'll leave now.
I couldn't save Tom.
Someone wants to meet you.
Tom has a big closet in his room.
Did you shave this morning?
I have news for you.
You can count on it.
I want a unicycle for my birthday.
Tom got up and walked out of the bar.
I forgot to tell Tom and Mary to bring their lunch.
Tom wasn't the only one who was late.
It seems that everybody likes golf.
Boil some water.
"Tom won't come, will he?"
We ate fresh fruit after dinner.
Tom was here a minute ago.
Tom is very cool.
I'll arrive in Boston tomorrow evening.
I don't think that Tom knows that I love him.
Where are your horses?
We can't wait for Tom.
The traffic jam was caused by an accident.
"I think I could do that, but I don't want to."
I've missed another chance.
Does anyone know when Tom is coming?
How long have I been asleep?
I need three volunteers.
I think that everyone knows that.
Tom was singing with the children sitting around the campfire.
What time did you go to bed yesterday?
There wasn't a soul in sight.
Everybody loved Tom.
I've also considered that possibility.
How much time does that take?
Tell me more about this.
You can't just walk away.
Don't ask stupid questions.
"I didn't mean to eavesdrop, but I did overhear you."
Don't walk home alone.
Tom and I don't have any children.
It has nothing to do with you.
I think you are a really nice person.
Won't Tom get suspicious?
I borrowed it.
Tom doesn't earn enough money to support a woman like Mary.
What can go wrong?
I went to Boston last year.
I want to see you laugh.
I'm a soldier now.
We believe you.
Tom looks like you.
Someone screamed.
I'm freezing.
French isn't as difficult as English.
Have you been a good girl?
Tom started to laugh and was joined by everyone in the room.
I hit upon a good idea.
There is nothing like a glass of beer after a whole day's work.
We can study here.
Where are you hiding?
My father is always forgetting things.
I'm concerned about your future.
The food was finger-licking good.
Something's wrong here.
The police did arrest someone.
I don't like meat. I prefer a vegetarian diet.
It's not big enough.
I knew Tom would find it.
It happened again last night.
She gave it to him.
Tom and I soon became close friends.
Should I ask Tom for help?
Tom promised he'd never do that again.
I'm glad that you succeeded.
How long do we have?
That's amazing.
Maybe I'm just crazy.
That bridge across this river is the oldest in the town.
That's my suitcase.
I don't know why Tom is so sad.
"At home, we speak French."
I'd like to thank you.
This is a very good thing.
Tom said that he didn't want to argue.
Mary is an intelligent and highly articulate young woman.
Which one will you choose?
We ought to get over there.
I consider myself a good wife.
I've got blue eyes.
What did you open it with?
You have no good reason for thinking as you do.
I sent Tom home.
I didn't want you to see me crying.
I've already told Tom not to do that anymore.
Try to be polite.
Tom is our son.
I'm not sure what you mean.
Why are you here?
It seemed too easy.
She plays the piano very well.
"He, and he alone, must go."
I had a horrible dream last night.
It's about time.
We can't trust him because he often tells lies.
I'm upstairs.
I don't understand how that works.
That's exactly what I thought.
Is it included in the price?
Are you still a smoker?
I don't doubt you.
What did you need to see me about?
Tom doesn't believe Mary will win.
I'd like to stay here with you.
It would have been better if you had stayed in America.
What you're saying is absolutely wrong.
Tom is an able lawyer.
There is a dog under the table.
I'm going to tell the truth.
Even expert drivers can make mistakes.
Tom is in there somewhere.
Hey. I know you.
We must do it now.
Tom has hundreds of books.
Your grades are better than mine.
Why did you change your plans?
It's very kind of you to help me.
Let's not talk about your job tonight.
Tom nodded approvingly.
I went to Boston on business.
I think everybody knows that.
What did Tom tell you about us?
You love Tom more than I do.
Why don't you do that yourself?
Tom was different.
Tom and Mary will get married sooner or later.
"Tom couldn't wait any longer, so he left."
I wish that I hadn't promised Tom I'd go to Australia with him.
"By the way, have you ever been to Europe?"
I slept like a log.
I wish I hadn't convinced Tom to do that.
He will write an answer very soon.
I've always wanted to live in Boston.
Tom unwrapped the gift carefully.
I'm sure I'll be able to do that sooner or later.
Tom arrived in Boston on October 20th.
Do you really think Tom can swim?
"I ate a modest breakfast of toast, coffee, and one egg."
When is my surgery?
Tom doesn't like either beer or wine.
We're all very proud of you.
Tom asked for a cup of coffee.
Take the dog for a walk.
He was imprisoned.
We go to Boston every Monday.
That's incurable.
I eat slowly.
Tom is waiting for Mary now.
He was named after his grandfather.
Tom is a little emotional.
I'll pay for myself.
You sound like a broken record.
I want to show you something.
This is our home.
He's my best friend. We're like brothers.
To speak English well is difficult.
Do you think Tom has lost weight?
I figured that it was better not to go without you.
Can you teach me to fight?
You don't need to shout.
Are you the one who let the dog in?
Tom lived half his life in Boston.
Do you really think that?
We've got to win.
I am happy to see you again.
Remember to mail this letter.
Tom isn't my uncle.
Do Tom and Mary like the same kind of movies?
Tom smiled at Mary when she walked in.
What did Tom give to you?
The library is on the 4th floor.
The flowers in the vase are roses.
"I'm sorry, I didn't know what else to do."
I'm the one to blame.
You're getting more and more beautiful.
You're obliged to tell me the truth.
Tom is a very smart boy.
You're conscientious.
I worked a couple of years as a farm hand.
What an incredible day!
How many famous astronomers can you name?
What's with your hair?
I'm a photographer.
The climate of Tokyo is different from that of London.
You didn't even smile.
I want to know what I can do to help.
He is out now.
Be watchful.
Can you read this kanji?
Tom wants to change that.
I owe you $30.
I found the book I had long been looking for.
Tom drinks beer every day.
Keep this.
Tom is your boss.
Is Tom still awake?
Her daughter is bad at cooking.
I couldn't tell Tom the truth.
Let's meet at 2:30.
I can play tennis.
You idiot!
Do you remember saying that?
She gave birth to a baby boy.
Does that tell you something?
I'll wait here until you get back.
I still want to go.
Did you ever see that movie?
You need to try this cake.
I suggested that the plan be postponed.
There's no one else here.
Both Tom and Mary are here.
Tom rolled up his shirt sleeves.
I want you to work with Tom.
Oranges grow in warm countries.
Tom has two children.
Tom didn't want to go to the meeting.
I think that you're right.
The key is on the table.
How are you now?
I thought you said that Tom was your brother.
It is of great use.
Have you taken out the garbage?
I'd like to see you.
The capital of France is Paris.
Tom eats a lot of Chinese food.
I haven't found Tom yet.
"Tom, Mary, John and Alice all went to the park to play on the merry-go-round."
You should sleep.
Tom knows where to find me if he needs me.
That depends on you.
Are you still unlucky?
I'm not going to buy this.
Tom is early.
Tom knows Mary is right.
The price of rice rose by more than three percent.
Were you in Australia with Tom?
Tom doesn't need to study French.
I cannot put up with her behavior.
I know that you don't like coffee.
I just wanted to say hello.
I want you to help me wash the windows.
You'll need it.
Tom came here to study French.
There's something I haven't told you.
I believe Tom is right.
Tom needs to be given a second chance.
Have you ever ridden a horse?
We need to leave right now.
Tom wanted to know where we were going.
I felt like laughing.
"Tom, do you like me?"
Take mine.
The puppy tried to bite my hand.
You shouldn't have said that.
Can you help?
I'm not going to tell you anything.
Look what a long reach Tom has.
I was afraid.
Let's find out.
Tom says he won't answer any questions.
How did Tom talk you into doing this?
I went to the theater to see a modern drama.
Do you have a cat?
I can now walk without crutches.
Tom knows better than to play with matches.
Money opens all doors.
Who will you be going to Boston with?
I'll call him later.
I want you to wash my car.
There's a slight problem.
I don't recommend doing that the way Tom suggested.
He returned home by way of Hong Kong.
Please say hello to your wife.
Put on your shoes.
I'll demonstrate.
Do you have any other suggestions?
I don't think that it's over yet.
Tom is much younger than you think he is.
I'll never forget what you did for my family.
I never found out why.
It's important to Tom.
I'm so grateful to you for this opportunity.
"Sit down, Tom."
Tom doesn't like sitting next to Mary.
Don't buy Tom anything.
I don't think I have one of those.
I'd like to stay in Boston for another week or so.
I am ready to follow you.
"Are those your books? ""No, they aren't."""
I like that person.
Hold your breath.
Tom brought home a basket full of plums that he had picked himself.
Tom already knows.
Congratulations on your promotion.
Would you like to stay for dinner?
She prodded him to work harder.
Why don't you like Tom?
Tom told us what to do.
I still can't believe Tom did that.
Everybody ignored what Tom was doing.
He has a cold.
I know that Tom is diabetic.
I read the note.
"You're curious, aren't you?"
I hope I'll never have to do that again.
I know we can do this if we try.
Tom isn't with us.
Tom deserves to be here.
"Well, what do you want me to say?"
I didn't think there was any difference.
The woman is fat.
I didn't think you'd be so late.
I never called Tom an idiot.
When do I have to return the car?
I'll pretend that I didn't hear that.
You don't look like Tom.
Do you mind if I turn on the radio?
Get out of there immediately.
Tom is three now.
Tom tried to commit suicide.
Your order is ready.
Have you been told when you are expected to be here?
Rice grows in warm climates.
I disagree with this completely.
I wonder why the dogs are barking.
We're very lucky to be alive.
We have a little surprise for you.
I don't think that.
She died of typhoid fever.
There are lot of places I haven't been to.
Tom kept Mary awake all night with his snoring.
It doesn't fit well here.
Do I have to study?
I ate a nutritious breakfast.
"You aren't a spy, are you?"
I'm powerless.
You'll have a wonderful time.
I think you'll be pleased.
They don't understand French at all.
Don't ever doubt it.
I just can't do it.
I get up at 7:00.
How would you do that?
What do you think of modern art?
I've seen you dance.
I see no need for Tom to do that.
We have a bit of time now.
He got caught kissing a girl in the back seat of the car.
Boston is my home.
The strange feeling came back.
That sounds familiar.
Tom and I both want to go.
Would you look after my children while I am away on vacation?
Tom and Mary insult each other all the time.
Don't you want to study?
I don't know where you work.
I never turn my back on a friend in need.
Tom told me where Mary lives.
"The average of 7, 10, and 16 is 11."
I have one friend.
Are you from the bank?
Where did I put the hammer?
The chicken is overcooked.
We have to go.
Tom doesn't want to walk.
Tom filled the three glasses with orange juice.
What do you want to say?
I'm selfish.
Tom likes Mary very much.
Why did you think that?
Tom agreed to help Mary do that.
Someone's here to see you.
Are you the mayor?
There's a big hole in your sock.
Keep on working while I'm away.
I don't want to live this way.
The island is uninhabited.
Why is there sawdust on the floor?
Who was that girl?
"I have seen ""Star Wars"" twice."
Can you tell silver and tin apart?
I know you'll get the job.
I have mixed feelings about that.
Are you sure you're not cold?
Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance you must keep moving.
"OK, I understand."
Tom said you were sick.
Everyone giggled.
The tree blocked the road.
This movie is suitable for children.
Tom has already told me what I needed to know.
Tom said nobody else was injured.
Tom told us a whole pack of lies.
I wanted to run away with you.
How much do I owe?
They should have the right to decide for themselves.
I'm not very hungry.
I thought Tom was still single.
You don't have to help if you don't want to.
"Before long, the moon came out."
Tom made a decision.
You're unusual.
Tom is writing on the blackboard.
"Look, I know you're busy."
"Not knowing what to say, I remained silent."
Tom is a great player.
Tom got hit by a car and died.
Tom had planned to catch up on some work over the weekend.
Tom is a lot shorter than Mary.
Go away. I don't want to see you.
He got a new job.
We can't stop now.
The earth is where we all live.
Tom was crafty.
Only a handful of people know the fact.
The path is slippery.
A dog was following Tom.
Did you tell them anything?
Everyone believed Tom.
Tom told me he'd go to Boston.
Tom smoked a cigarette.
Tom is his real name.
Don't say that.
They fought until the end.
I am a man.
He took off his coat.
What we did was necessary.
Why does ice float?
Go to the hardware store and get screws.
Everyone likes Tom.
Nothing more is needed.
I don't think I can do that tonight.
Perhaps I should talk to Tom.
Look me up sometime.
Thanks for your comments.
I don't think that it affects us.
I didn't give it to you.
It'll take approximately three hours.
I must say I'm a bit disappointed.
I'm the head coach.
It's cool today.
There is a castle in the background of the picture.
"I don't know how, but Tom did it."
"Take a deep breath, please."
Tom might want to go to Australia with you.
It is not necessary for us to attend this lecture.
He sat in the chair.
I didn't know how.
I assume you know who that is.
The product carries a high price tag.
He criticizes everything.
They defended their homeland against the invaders.
Education helps to mold character.
Buying such an expensive car is out of the question.
He was listening to music in his room.
Tom is very intelligent.
I always counted you as a friend.
Tom grinds his teeth in his sleep.
Tom has always been smart.
Have you heard anything about the organization?
I only have butter in my refrigerator.
This is the reason why he did it.
I don't know where Tom put his umbrella.
Tom isn't available at the moment.
Stay with me here.
I bought a slow cooker.
What time did Tom go to bed?
She isn't lonely anymore.
The train had already left when I arrived at the station.
I like coming to Boston.
Tom sat behind Mary.
I can hardly believe you're here.
How do I know who to trust?
"For the most part, I enjoy watching all sports on TV."
That's what I wanted to hear.
Why do you close your eyes when you kiss me?
He's a gentleman.
Can Tom do it?
I'm a simple girl.
This is the dictionary I told you about yesterday.
He left the house without saying goodbye.
Tom gave Mary his kidney.
What time do you want me to be at work tomorrow?
Tom is hard to talk to.
When are you going to stop laughing like an idiot?
That was ours.
Tom is also in the choir.
I'm your lawyer.
Is he at home?
Is this normal?
I lost my temper.
Did you ever work with Tom?
I guess you were right.
These pens are his.
Tom just wanted to have fun.
Tom and Mary had trouble making themselves understood in French.
Add one teaspoon of paprika.
I was shy.
It's necessary for you to go.
Your sons are quite handsome.
We're clean.
Tom may already be dead.
An illustration may make the point clear.
Tom died in an airplane accident.
May I smoke?
Tom turned on the heater.
I have no one else to turn to but you.
I'm going to wait here for Tom.
I thought I would die.
I was hiding.
I was busy.
No one visited me today.
What do they know that we don't?
Tom says he's planning to go back to Boston for Christmas.
I get on very well with your cousin.
I think I'm in love with you.
What time will you be home this evening?
I know that Tom likes basketball.
The rich have many friends.
They will help.
This bomb can kill a lot of people.
"Why are you going to Japan? ""To attend a conference in Tokyo."""
I'll sign it.
Tom felt like a fool.
Why should we learn French?
The scent of cedar repels moths.
Tom hates Halloween.
She has forgiven him.
Tom snuck out of the office.
What does it look like?
Don't disturb the others.
She doesn't shave her legs.
I still haven't done what Tom asked me to do.
I can dance.
Who were they looking for?
I don't like Tom anymore.
"I'm sorry, but I can't do that."
"How are you? ""I am fine, thank you."""
Is it really so terrible?
This letter's for me.
I didn't know you were home.
Let Mary do her job.
Tom cut off all ties with Mary.
You haven't eaten a bite.
I'll let you know.
Tom will decide.
I believe that you'll win.
I'm doing what I've been told to do.
Why are you sneezing?
I told Tom I didn't want to ever see him again.
That's a start.
Can you walk on stilts?
"Read it one more time, please."
It was such a nice day.
Everybody will be tired.
How pathetic!
My room is upstairs on the left.
The meeting room is occupied at the moment.
Tell me in plain English.
Tom got up to leave.
Tom is here to help Mary figure out her income taxes.
This song is very popular in Japan.
I'm not surprised you don't remember.
Didn't you know Tom couldn't speak French?
Tom has finally done that.
I cleaned the house.
I've already told you I don't want to do that.
He is a bus driver.
Can't you guess what I'm doing?
Tom doesn't like grapes.
"Wherever you go, I will follow you."
I'll do my homework later.
Tom would never leave Australia without his children.
Don't say something you'll regret later.
"To tell the truth, it does not always pay to tell the truth."
I wish that Tom hadn't told Mary that I'd been in prison.
I'm doing this to help you.
Tom called off his trip.
Tom and I are teammates.
Return fire.
"Tom loved Mary, but she didn't love him back."
Tom said that he'd call you later.
Tom says that he doesn't like weddings.
It's going to affect our economy.
Tom told Mary it wouldn't be easy.
I don't want to see him at all.
"With your help, our plan would succeed."
I thought Tom would live forever.
I'd like to stay in Boston for another week or so.
I think that Tom will be OK.
"You didn't tell them, did you?"
I compromised with Tom.
I love living with you.
I knew I should've gone with you.
How much does an apple cost?
Nobody was there but Tom.
I'd hate to die young.
Is that why you called?
Tom is very excited.
Mary wanted to be a wife and a mother.
This is a bad sign.
Tom heard someone scream.
"As I told you, Tom is dying."
It is a pity that the singer died so young.
Have you already started learning French?
Aren't you forgetting something?
Tom isn't going to help Mary do that.
I need to eat now.
Did you know that was happening?
I study English on Monday and Friday.
Tom is going to be doing that.
I worry about you all the time.
We understand.
I was not a good mother.
I don't think Tom trusts Mary.
Say goodbye.
Tom bought a very expensive camera.
Tom ruined our camping trip by forgetting to put the tent in the car.
They are having dinner.
Tom is a lot shorter than you.
I'm not too worried about Tom.
Do you have anything to add?
"Tom is in the kitchen, washing dishes."
Your computer will restart several times during installation.
I've already voted.
Tom and Mary both know that's unlikely to happen.
I told Tom I didn't know any other way to do that.
"Until he comes, I can't go."
Let's talk about Tom.
Do you still buy lottery tickets?
I'll love you for the rest of my life.
Do you really think Tom is crazy?
I haven't given up.
I don't think Tom liked the concert.
Tom works as a waiter.
We both saw it.
It wasn't just me who didn't like that movie.
She advised him not to go.
Didn't you know that Tom spent time in prison?
Do you think Tom is really there?
You can't lose.
Will you do that tomorrow?
I don't know when I'm supposed to do that.
I asked him where I should park my car.
That isn't real.
Tom is staying there.
"I can't fix all of these problems, but I can fix some of them."
I'd like you to come with me.
Your stupid remark just added fuel to the flames.
I'm of the opinion that he should apologize to his teacher.
I went to bed a little later than usual.
Are you fast enough?
I think everyone knows that.
I saw the moon above the horizon.
It's going to be a good year.
Everyone knows that you're lying.
Tom will be there as well.
He didn't catch the signal.
Tom says he did nothing wrong.
It's easy money.
I didn't betray you.
I'm pretty certain that Tom is in Australia now.
I will see to it that everything is ready in time.
You can watch TV after supper.
This newspaper is old.
I have to be on time.
Were you addressing me?
Tom decided to make spaghetti for dinner.
I haven't read this book yet.
Look at the mountains covered with snow.
Who said that to you?
Tom doesn't want to go with you.
She finally made it.
I almost got robbed.
We can't let them do that.
I'd like to stay here for a few more days.
I thought you already did that.
I'm not selling anything.
Don't talk to me that way.
"Because of the storm, we couldn't search for the lost child."
My parents were teachers.
I didn't know you were expecting anyone.
Tell Tom I'm innocent.
Tom is by nature a very quiet person.
Tom isn't as spry as he used to be.
She hated him.
We don't know.
"If you keep on drinking like that, you'll be drunk very soon."
What's the airmail rate?
Keep a cool head.
Tom told me you wouldn't win.
I work tomorrow morning.
I know a store where you can buy that.
"Is he lying? ""Obviously."""
My strength is all gone.
I knew we couldn't trust you.
The defense was pleased by the verdict.
I received an invitation to the birthday party.
Tom is always complaining about his boss.
Did you take Tom's advice?
I'm untalented.
The speaker cleared his throat.
I have to go help Tom.
Tadpoles become frogs.
I took the cake out of the oven too early.
"I do have one final ask of you as your president, the same thing I asked when you took a chance on me eight years ago. I'm asking you to believe, not in my ability to bring about change but in yours."
"I bought chicken, even though Tom wanted me to buy beef."
We admired the beauty of the scenery.
Her father is tall.
I do not deserve it.
I'm going to wait till 2:30.
"We waited, but Tom didn't come."
Tom got on the plane.
When will you complete the preparations?
I'm going to give you something.
I knew Tom better than you did.
"If you can't have children, you could always adopt."
Did Tom get the briefcase?
There is no one there.
Tom said Mary would most likely win.
Don't hurt her.
"This is my umbrella, not Tom's."
She painted the wall pink.
We're trying to work here.
Tom said that Mary helped you.
How much is rye flour?
Does it surprise you?
Did you show it to your parents?
Can I call you back?
Where can you get tickets?
I normally don't make these kinds of mistakes.
Give me time to think about it.
You were wrong after all.
Tom will talk to us on Monday.
You disgust me.
I want you to remember this moment.
Did you also invite your friends?
He will be back in a day or two.
Remember to turn off the lights.
Is the beam solid or hollow?
What a waste of water!
We went to Boston last year for the first time.
I've got to speak to you.
Tom was in total shock.
I'm not a celebrity.
Tom found one.
They attained their aim.
Everyone loves that place.
We have lunch at noon.
Tom showed us how to do that.
She will make him a good wife.
Tom is afraid of getting caught.
Stir the paint with a stick.
I'll wait for you here.
Tom is a year older than me.
You could stay.
"Stop it. He's our friend, isn't he?"
It's not too much.
Why don't you have any clothes on?
The post office is that brown building.
I think Tom could accomplish just about anything he decides to do.
Nothing will happen.
He is telling a lie.
Has Tom been helpful?
She turned her eyes away.
We've got a room for you.
I seem to have caught a cold.
Tom gave Mary an engagement ring.
Tom didn't think Mary was ready.
I'll buy some cheese and bread.
You're wrong. That isn't what I said.
She revealed her secret to us.
I don't know how many times Tom has gone to Boston.
I didn't mean to offend you.
I didn't suspect anything.
The traffic light changed to red.
I'm amazed Tom is still alive.
I must catch the first train.
Are you a Canadian citizen?
The date of manufacture is shown on the lid.
Let's stop doing this.
What a wonderful view!
Tom couldn't answer the last question.
You have made a promise.
April is the fourth month of the year.
Do you want to get out of here or not?
Your time is up.
I have great friends.
You're an adult.
You're really dirty.
My parents really love me.
The plane had already left the airport.
He has no common sense.
What country's flag is that?
Now beat it.
He wanted to be a farmer.
Honey doesn't spoil.
I hope that you're not afraid.
I speak neither French nor English.
Are you good at skiing?
What's the closest planet to the sun?
I'm a masochist.
Tom is twice as tall as Mary.
Have you finished your homework yet?
Are you prudent?
This is what I've always wanted to do.
Everyone stopped talking and stared at me.
I had a similar experience once.
I would like to visit you.
Can we talk to you?
Tom and Mary both started to laugh.
"Come on, wake up."
Tom knows Mary's weaknesses.
I won't need this.
Tom doesn't believe Mary will win.
Where has Tom been?
"Although we don't have much money, I want to buy this painting."
It's dangerous to live near a volcano.
Tom says he wants to talk to you.
We studied French for three years.
Tom said he regretted the decision.
"You're in love with someone else, aren't you?"
She plays tennis after school.
Who put you up to it?
Are you telling me that I can't go?
Do you want to see what I've got?
I don't know how much time I've got.
Tom and Mary both looked at John.
You're so handsome.
Don't say his name.
I'm feeling great.
I found it in the attic.
I saw the way Tom was looking at you.
No one is going to stop you.
She went upstairs.
Let's study.
It only weighs 3 kilograms.
I know you did it on purpose.
Tom forgot to wear gloves.
I'm surprised you couldn't remember that.
I hope Tom doesn't do anything like that again.
It's hard to decide where to go.
You're the leader.
"Whatever you do, don't cry."
Tom isn't very different from anybody else.
I clicked the first link on the page.
I've lost my watch.
Aren't you alone?
Treatment will begin tomorrow.
Do you want to call Tom or do you want me to?
Did you buy flowers?
I'm going to see Tom today.
We are the same age. We are both sixteen years old.
"One of his two daughters lives in Tokyo, and the other in Nara."
Talk to somebody.
We saw them on TV.
Something came up.
They'll understand us.
We don't like cheese.
I wonder what's inside the box.
I'll help you find it.
I would rather have a coffee.
Don't make generalizations.
You've given me good advice.
Has anybody talked to you?
I go there every day.
Someone has been here before us.
Tom told me he'd do that.
Turn off the alarm.
I'll be gone this weekend.
How can I join the team?
We've known each other for thirty years.
"It has been raining since the day before yesterday, but it may clear up this afternoon."
No one was above suspicion.
I can't give you an immediate answer.
I can't explain it any other way.
Have you finished writing your reports yet?
She was engaged as an interpreter.
Tom often drinks alone.
We import grain from the United States.
Please insert your card.
Tom slipped and fell.
I know you hate funerals.
What've you lost?
"I won't do that now, because I'm tired."
They divided the money among themselves.
Dark clouds are a sign of rain.
Have you heard the news?
"He was able to cook himself dinner, after a fashion."
That'll be enough.
Why did Tom attack you?
Tom drank straight from the can.
"Tom is a drummer, too."
This pen belongs to me.
My father could swim well when he was young.
The young chemist decided to open a pharmacy.
Which season do you like the best?
Tom is not much older than Mary's daughter.
"During the Depression in the 1930's, many wealthy people lost everything in the stock market crash."
I won't let them hurt you.
He went to bed.
That is plastic.
Tom was a great teammate.
We're hiding.
Tom thinks Mary is a genius.
Alcohol damages the liver.
Tom said you liked baseball.
Your letter made me happy.
That was a bad bet.
I went to Boston for 5 days on a business trip.
I heard a noise outside.
He seems to have been ill for a long time.
I'm getting up at six o'clock tomorrow morning.
I've done that lots of times.
Tom is the only one who knows where Mary is.
"Tom wants to do that, too."
Tom knew absolutely nothing about it.
These are my sister's magazines.
They took my children away from me.
People rose in revolt against the King.
He failed in his attempt to swim across the river.
I actually did that myself.
This one's free.
Tom said that he doesn't care.
Let's meet at 6:30.
They called off their engagement.
Tom asked Mary to do that.
It's about time the manager was removed.
Let's hope that that doesn't happen again.
We didn't bring it with us.
You place me in a difficult position.
He instantly fell in love with her.
It's raining outside.
That happens all the time.
I sent you a box of chocolates.
That's his.
I go to the barber's once a month.
Please shut the door.
I think they scared you a bit.
Are you sure Tom will win?
I knew it couldn't be that simple.
What did you tell Tom for?
I got better after taking that medicine.
"Does he like music? ""Yes, he does."""
Do you want this one or that one?
I don't deserve to be punished.
We heard you.
Why don't you buy it?
Tom thought the same thing I did.
Where does this train go?
Just fill this out.
Will you have time to have lunch with me?
I especially liked the way you sang the second song.
He is much better than me at the high jump.
We played chess every morning.
The wind calmed down.
I don't think that Tom will come to the party.
I'm not happy with my job.
It is possible that he will come to our party.
Tom is probably right.
Add 3 spoonfuls of white wine.
He earned her love.
Why do you always wear that hat?
I asked Tom not to drive too fast.
Have you ever seen Tom cry?
I already knew everyone.
Someone is watching you.
Tom has agreed to do that.
Tom was right about that.
We haven't thought about it.
Tom is paid by the hour.
I wish we hadn't done that.
He's still single.
Tom found my bike.
Did you sign?
Don't talk to your father like that.
Put the words in alphabetical order.
Where do you stay when you're in Boston?
Are you still working in Boston?
Show them to me.
This is a megaphone.
He got angry.
Tom cut his sister a piece of cake.
Does Tom drink tea?
That's not the way it happened.
Let's leave.
What else do you see?
Tom wanted to live close to school.
Tom likes raw carrots.
It looks like you don't know what to do.
How soon will lunch be ready?
"I received an invitation from Tom, but didn't accept it."
Tom likes tofu.
You still haven't told me why you quit your job.
Tom is much better at doing that than I am.
Never trust anybody.
I feel good this morning.
Yesterday it was so cold that I stayed home.
There's something I'd like to ask you.
How many letters did you send to Tom?
Take care.
She cleaned her room in a hurry.
I bought a lot of books.
Crush the can before you throw it away.
The victims haven't yet been identified.
Did you draw this?
I'm very cold.
I don't think I heard you correctly.
This is a part of life.
I always wanted to be a father.
"Be quiet, all of you."
Tom asked me to read him some poems.
I want to talk to you alone.
Tom is self-centered.
I'm Tom's new secretary.
We didn't want to begin without you.
We haven't forgotten you.
I'll discuss the matter with Tom.
Tom was afraid to ask for help.
There were two pieces of cake.
Don't let Tom in.
It won't be long before they get married.
Come and warm yourself by the fire.
I want more days like this.
It's not a vice.
Do you need a car?
Don't make me choose.
It isn't Tom.
She's wearing sunglasses.
The situation was very comical.
What'll happen to your family if you die?
How much did your school uniform cost?
Don't blame Tom for what Mary did.
Kumi is the girl whose father likes dogs.
Tom stayed in Boston for the summer.
"You're wrong, Tom."
I can't understand what you're saying.
Tom taught me how to cook.
It snowed for three more days.
I just need you to sign this.
"Wherever you go, I will follow you."
I don't know that much about Tom.
A day without you is like a summer without the sun.
Do you want me to help you do that?
The window was wide open.
Do you believe me?
Why don't you want to go?
I think there's something Tom wants.
Tom told me you wouldn't do that.
I became Tom's friend.
Tom turned his flashlight on.
I know that Tom is sincere.
Can you show me where the bathroom is?
I'd like to stay at your hotel.
I'm powerful.
Unwrap it carefully.
Tom is confused.
My father is in the garden now.
You should have told me in advance.
They sent for the doctor.
Where can we find Tom?
You seem different.
I don't think Tom recognized me.
Go to the store and buy us some food.
We have so many students.
Tom is lying on the ground.
I have a good life now.
I'm hiding from Tom.
It's dangerous to play with fire.
I need you to focus and listen to me.
You're shorter than Tom.
Mary was upset when she saw a picture of Tom's ex-girlfriend in his wallet.
We keep three dogs and a cat.
They drank coffee.
I didn't know Tom was at home.
It doesn't make any sense.
You must be the temporary we asked for.
You look good in that dress.
My hands are numb from the cold.
You're the reason I stayed here so long.
The United States' Civil War lasted four years.
I've been waiting for you for over an hour.
Don't ever call me again.
Nothing is as precious as love.
Do you have any food allergies?
How much did you pay for this?
Close that door.
This photo was taken in Nara.
I don't like any of you.
I plan to invite a lot of guests to the opening ceremony.
Is the road open?
I'll go get the broom.
There is a desk in this room.
I think we need to take a break.
Please read the meter.
Don't handle these tools roughly.
"Tom has already told you, hasn't he?"
Tom didn't need to look at the menu because he'd been to that restaurant many times before.
Are they the people you saw yesterday?
These thermal socks will keep your feet warm.
Nothing out of the ordinary happened on our trip.
Only Tom didn't want to go.
Did Tom get any gifts?
Do you think they suspect me?
Tom and Mary live a simple life.
Tom cleaned the toilet.
I'm waiting for Tom to leave.
I'm not going to explain it to you.
I'm not talking to you.
Tom didn't think Mary was bored.
I need a red pencil.
"After I had finished the job, I went to bed."
Bring me some water.
Tom is sure to help you.
Tom asked for money.
She had twins.
I didn't know you did that.
The room is too small to play in.
That's why Tom is here.
Tom is new to the job.
We wanted Tom.
I don't like scary movies.
He studies Chinese.
Keep talking.
Would you risk it?
It's doubtful that anything will get done here today.
I've never liked Tom.
Tom has been managing just fine.
I knew you'd come back for me.
We have to get dressed.
We don't have a daughter.
I don't know Tom that well.
What did you go there for?
"You're not mad anymore, are you?"
Tom is ready to forgive Mary.
Tom must have nerves of steel.
What have we done?
"You have no idea what's going on, do you?"
"You're a philosopher, aren't you?"
You're such a cheapskate.
It'll probably snow tomorrow.
Don't worry about me. I can take care of myself.
Tom turned thirteen.
You can't undress a naked man.
A permit is required.
I'm going to need more money than that.
"I have five copies, but I need twice as many."
Please forgive me for telling a lie.
Tom doesn't know what Mary's shoe size is.
I'm so tired.
She can't even speak her native language without making mistakes.
Children should obey their parents.
She thinks of everything in terms of money.
We're both writers.
Can I buy you lunch?
The convention opened as planned.
Why's Tom afraid of Mary?
Tom handed Mary a thick gray envelope.
I won't be here long.
Tom can't help me.
What's that noise?
Do we really need this much food?
Please hold a moment. I will see if he is back.
Tom gave me a black eye.
I need ice cubes.
Are you in Australia?
Sit down there.
Did you leave a message?
Tom has done something terrible.
I noticed a pattern.
Have you heard any good jokes lately?
I have responsibilities.
Tom didn't tell me about you.
Tom wants a microscope.
How do you want me to help?
Do you know how long I've been waiting for Tom?
Tom resuscitated Mary.
Thank you for asking.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
We have nothing else.
How long is the ticket good for?
They know better.
Please tell me what that is.
It's not over.
He found it.
I'll come see you later.
I have heard the story.
I told you I didn't want any coffee.
"Tell me, briefly, what happened."
Tom said that he didn't have time to eat.
I didn't go anywhere during the holiday.
Why do you think Tom would do that?
I know that Tom isn't rich.
Tom is unavailable.
Women don't wear dresses as often as they used to.
I'll get back to you.
The monkey climbed up the tree.
Tom started whining.
You can rest for a little bit.
The sky was gray.
This water is safe to drink.
You abandoned me.
You've probably got someplace to go.
Didn't you know that Tom used to teach French in Australia?
Is Tom out of his mind?
Do your children know French?
"When Tom speaks, people listen."
Giving up smoking is the easiest thing in the world. I know because I've done it thousands of times.
When will Tom go to Boston?
I didn't know you were so old.
No one has called me today.
You're sociable.
Tom might know the answer.
I don't think Tom knows what you want.
I didn't see Tom.
Tom made me promise not to tell Mary his phone number.
I looked for Tom and Mary for over an hour.
Are you sure you want to do this right now?
I want you to do nothing.
You're first.
"Since I wasn't hungry, I only ordered coffee."
My wife is preparing dinner right now.
"You're not planning to stay up all night, are you?"
I want to bring my family here.
She goes to the market once a week.
We're going to find a cure.
Tell me the reason why she got angry.
I want to spend my life with you.
Tom came in through the window.
Tom was fast asleep when Mary entered the room.
This box will serve as a table.
Please put this in the microwave oven.
I still can't believe you're married.
Tom and Mary grow leaf lettuce in their garden.
Tom said that I looked unhappy.
That's all I can say.
Are you sure that you haven't forgotten anything?
I can't help anyone.
Help me if you can.
Do you know of any good restaurants around here?
Tom was curious to know Mary's secret.
Watch out for the car!
Tom is worried.
We'll wait in the lobby.
When did you have time to do that?
I know this is my own fault.
My grandfather no longer drives.
That's not what I wrote.
I was told never to do that.
I want to get rid of it.
Who's on the team?
The road we were going to take is closed.
She is a serious person.
We'll cooperate.
We're rich.
When did you and Tom buy that?
I didn't want to go with you.
I told Tom I wouldn't do it.
Tom is supposedly healthy.
I'll tell you how to do that.
Tom might not want to do that.
Look behind you.
I will stay home tomorrow.
Where else are you going to go?
"That's mine, too."
Tom couldn't figure out what Mary meant.
I didn't know this would happen.
My mother made me clean the bathroom.
Tom hasn't said anything yet.
We left soon after that.
Tom tried to understand.
We're not done playing yet.
Take what you need.
Are you sure his name was Tom?
Tom used to be my French teacher.
Let's go there today.
I almost forgot my passport.
Why didn't you want me to come here?
I'd like to talk to you.
I won't be able to attend your wedding.
I made that one.
"Tom is going to Mary's birthday party tomorrow, isn't he?"
Most castles have a moat surrounding them.
My flight back to Boston leaves in three hours.
Have you ever known them to come on time?
How much are they paying Tom?
Did you hear that?
I think I should go home now.
Do you like horses?
Tom worked for Mary.
There were a lot of people at the concert.
What're you going to do during your summer vacation?
Clean the room.
I'm Tom's mentor.
Tom waved the flag.
I don't want to hear another peep out of you!
Tom said nothing about Mary.
I generally walk to school.
Do you think that plants feel pain?
I don't want to quit this job.
Tom will leave tonight.
I spoke French with Tom.
Things are going to change.
I admit I made a mistake.
Hand it over.
Eat as much as you want.
Tom and Mary are happy.
I want you to look for Tom.
Tom shut the lid.
We're not safe here.
My dream went up in smoke.
Tom and Mary were eating in silence.
Tom told me not to tell you.
You've kept your promise.
This is a story about friendship between a young boy and an elderly woman.
You'll have to go.
Some bus stops have benches.
I'll never do that.
He is a new addition to the teaching staff.
Find out what they said.
Tom didn't take Mary seriously.
"I work in Boston. ""I work in Boston, too."""
The radio is broken.
This crowd reminds me of the streets of Tokyo.
You're a little liar.
You've got to win.
The number of visitors to Singapore has increased year by year.
You'll be busy.
I'd like a fork.
Why didn't you sing with us?
I warned you.
The climate of New Zealand is similar to that of Japan.
Tom never seems to get angry.
I usually go to bed at ten.
He wiped his hands on a handkerchief.
Tom has a good command of French.
Tom will be going to Boston with me.
I had to tell Tom.
You sound like my wife.
It'll probably take you about three hours to do that.
Get off my car.
I have trouble with physics.
Tom and Mary have been together for thirty years.
Who's in command of this unit?
That was great advice.
We played baseball yesterday.
The fire was so intense that the firemen couldn't get into the house.
Tom's safe.
Six squared equals thirty-six.
Tom retired last year.
I hoped that everybody would laugh.
I am happy to see you again.
I want to have nothing to do with you.
We try to go to Boston at least once a year.
He would sit in the sun doing nothing.
His schedule has been changed.
He told the truth.
Courtesy costs nothing.
He's a bartender.
I still don't understand what you want from me.
I have all the friends I need.
Yukio Mishima killed himself in 1970.
"You'll help us, won't you?"
Why hasn't Tom already done that?
I don't think that's why Tom left.
I refuse to leave.
I'm not sleepy.
Maybe it was obvious.
Did you do what I asked?
I speak French to my staff.
We've resolved the problem.
He's very fast.
Do you know what she said?
"This is a joke, right?"
Tell Tom I'll be back.
He ignored his father's advice.
Tom got back in his car and drove away.
Tom's pulse is weak.
I suspected that something like this might happen.
"If you were in my place, what would you do?"
Tom takes care of my children.
I'm going to need your help doing this.
Tell me to leave and I'll leave.
I've never done that before.
I'm calling from my cell phone.
The room was empty.
I hope that Tom stays in Australia.
I advise you to be punctual.
Can you help us out?
I don't think that I've changed so much.
It's a lot of fun to listen to music.
She must go there.
"Tom is a little impulsive, isn't he?"
I've asked Tom to take my place.
I hope I'll see you again.
Tom doesn't shave yet.
Tom helped everybody.
I apologize for the late reply.
Go and apologize to Tom.
"If you see a suspicious person, please inform the police."
We aided him in his business.
Whoever wants it may take it.
Tom wants a French-English dictionary.
I knew that.
The damage was covered by insurance.
Tom doesn't know what Mary is trying to do.
You really need to get a haircut.
Aren't you supposed to be in Boston?
Only my mother understands me.
Show me the plan.
I think it's unlikely that Tom will be able to do that.
Isn't that the Golden Gate Bridge?
The requests were denied.
Do you come to Boston often?
"Unfortunately, I have other plans."
My father loves pizza.
Just don't surrender.
I need an aspirin.
You're very smart.
I think that Tom didn't understand the joke.
"I am not a doctor, but a teacher."
We're working at the moment.
I think we're going to stay for another day.
Tom and his friends painted the barn yesterday.
Let me explain to you how this works.
Which one would you recommend that I buy?
You may go anywhere you like.
Tom got very bored.
Here's my card.
You're asking for too much.
I did it.
I want to sleep now.
I've seen my share of death.
My father likes his job.
Did Tom say how he was able to do it?
I'm not going to explain it to you.
Tom has it all under control.
I wonder who'll win.
Tell him to call me tomorrow at noon.
How many apples did you buy?
Tom said that he was wrong.
Tom said I was walking too fast.
Tom didn't see Mary anywhere.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
I said stop right there!
Tom was almost as surprised as Mary.
You'll soon find out.
The drawer is empty.
I've got a long way to go.
Does he have money?
She threw a suspicious glance at him.
I'll start.
Every available car was being used.
Would you like to try it on?
We have to hurry.
We have every advantage over them.
Where can I meet you?
Tom wants you to kill Mary.
Even Japanese can make mistakes when they speak Japanese.
Each of the boys was eager to join in the race.
You've dropped your pen.
Do you remember when you last saw Tom?
I don't think Tom will be busy tomorrow.
I was very tired.
I wish she would stop playing that stupid music.
Tom forgot to lock his car.
I'd like to take Tom up on his offer.
Why do you want to change shifts?
I'll be here all night.
Turn off the light and go to sleep.
I'm meeting Tom at 2:30.
My father is not always free on Sunday.
The conference starts on Monday.
I was happy to see him.
I wanted to talk to you first.
Tom can't come to Boston this year.
Is that what you think of me?
"She asked him to call her later, but he forgot to."
Can I borrow a shirt?
Did you know where Tom was staying?
Which ones are Tom's?
Tom never allowed Mary to see what was in his safe.
I don't think Tom and Mary are so strange.
What were you waiting for?
Let me think a minute.
Did you feed the dog?
I didn't know you could understand French.
I prefer to go alone.
Spread the word.
I thought we were just going to talk to Tom.
Don't lose heart.
What do you think of all this?
I think that's why Tom doesn't have any friends.
Your wife is a very lucky woman.
I didn't get a chance.
You're the only one I called.
"He has many foreign stamps, not to mention Japanese ones."
I'll phone you when I arrive.
Why won't you be here tomorrow?
What do you want from us?
Let me guess.
Tom told me that he needed some money.
I'll be in Australia for three more days.
Why don't you like Tom?
Tom has left the door open.
Once was enough.
Tom applauded.
Tom hoped Mary wouldn't be late.
Tom is here to help Mary.
Let's help each other.
Do you think that he will pass the examination?
Where were you at the time of the fire?
I hardly recognized you.
I have a granddaughter about your age.
What are you working on?
Tom is a confirmed bachelor.
It's already decided.
Tom wanted me to wait for him.
I have an aunt and uncle in Boston.
Tom will get well in a week.
Tell me what you're thinking.
I thought I'd never see you again.
I know Tom better than he knows himself.
We elected Tom captain of the team.
Tom got exactly what he wanted.
I have some doubts about his coming in this weather.
Tom decided to sell his car.
She didn't know what to say to him.
Go and apologize to Tom.
Why did she come home early?
I knew you'd like doing that.
I've analyzed the liquid.
I've decided to tell Tom that I like him.
I don't want to answer the question.
You left your headlights on.
Tom is unable to move.
May I ask why you don't want to talk about this?
Tom altered his plans.
Some people think that I'm nuts.
Tom said that Mary was worried.
Tom shooed the flies away.
Tom told me that he'd try to win.
They say he was a musician when he was young.
Tom made Mary wash the car.
Keep in mind that you must die.
I knew Tom would have enough time.
I think that Tom should stay.
I can go anywhere.
My wife will stay home with the kids.
They're dimming the lights. The play is about to begin.
You'd better do what we told you to do.
"As soon as he comes back, let me know."
I'm going to call Tom right now.
He gave her a kiss on the hand.
"It is windy today, isn't it?"
"I don't want children, but my husband does."
Where did Tom get it?
I talk to Tom on the phone every day.
Where do you think I met her?
"Which one do you prefer, this one or that one?"
What do you mean?
Tom swims as fast as Mary.
You need to write it yourself.
I suppose you know why Tom didn't do what we asked him to do.
Tom isn't as pessimistic as I am.
Tom knows Mary.
Lincoln was a great statesman.
She's hiding the truth from us.
Tom said he wasn't ready to go home.
I am a student of this school.
Tom and Mary got married in Boston.
Tom almost hurt himself trying to do that.
Do you remember anything else?
His car has just been repaired.
How did you know I was hungry?
Tom is a bit pale.
We must always try to help others.
We're just having fun.
I can't figure out why.
Do you think I'd let that stop me?
How long did you stay in Boston?
Tom has a black cat.
He was very happy.
You can't come in.
When will you return my book to me?
We saw you on TV.
Tom was arrested the next day.
I thought something terrible had happened to you.
The cat is on the mat.
Shut up and listen to me.
Tom won't have to go there anymore.
You said you wanted to hear the truth.
Did you actually see Tom win?
The negotiations fell through.
I think it's an important event.
I really don't have the time.
That applies to him too.
Where will we meet?
I don't see any difference.
"You hate Tom, right?"
I hate milk.
I'm not your friend anymore.
We're done talking.
I often get up very early.
Tom wasn't told why Mary wasn't allowed to see him.
Are you still waiting for somebody?
There's a coffee stain on your necktie.
She bought a new house the other day.
I want you to help.
That's exactly what I said.
That still doesn't solve the problem.
You should've apologized to Tom.
They each paid separately.
Let's try that again.
Tom wants to stop us.
Help me and I'll help you.
I'm laughing at you.
The police caught the thief.
Tom looks like a nervous wreck.
"This isn't the last train, is it?"
I love this idea.
What game do you want to play?
Both Tom and I are painters.
Go take a walk.
Allow me to go.
Has Tom already been told about this?
There are many medieval castles in Europe.
I was wondering if I could borrow your car.
What else needs to be done?
He can count up to ten with his fingers.
Can I play you a song?
We weren't fighting.
Nobody is watching us.
I'm sure of it.
Some people dislike eels because they look like snakes.
Quit acting like a child.
"Tom is at the bus stop, waiting for a bus."
Tom and Mary just wanted to dance with each other all evening.
"Tom waited, but nobody came."
That's not uncommon.
I'll help Tom tomorrow.
"I'd like to stay and chat, but I've got a meeting to go to."
Tom has no idea who did that.
What floor is it on?
She was watching the dead leaves falling.
I've never told anyone about Tom.
I could kill you.
It is none of your business.
Tom is such a snob.
Tom asked Mary to buy a some eggs.
Tom didn't seem to be surprised that Mary wasn't able to do that.
Tom doubted that Mary would keep her promise.
Tom can't use it.
I was busy studying for a test.
I expect Tom back soon.
Tom decided not to go to the party.
Dig faster.
Oranges have a high vitamin content.
I want a new bike.
I didn't order any fruit.
Don't you have anything to eat?
What do you think of Japanese food?
I must stay here.
Tom didn't tell us about that.
I agreed to stay.
Tom walked into the bathroom.
Do you think I should go to Boston with Tom?
Tom won't let anything happen to you.
Don't you want your children to learn French?
Was Tom asleep?
I thought you might need it.
Do you think you can fix this?
Tom's face lit up with joy.
Tom is pretty ugly.
I found it in the attic.
I'm not the only one who wants to go.
I took the cake out of the oven.
Tom was about to say something when Mary entered the room.
Tom wants to read a book.
Did you read all the small print?
I never meant to hurt you.
We know this is hard for you.
I forgot to send you an e-mail.
Tom thought the worst was over.
Tom needs to lose a bit of weight.
Why do dogs chase squirrels?
I wish you hadn't told Tom I had trouble doing that.
Are you drunk?
I can't do what you're asking me to do.
I wish I'd met her.
Where will you go tomorrow?
Is that an invitation?
"It doesn't work, does it?"
Wisdom does not automatically come with age.
Is this French?
Tom has asked me to come to his house tomorrow.
Take away this box.
Are you the one who wrote this?
"If you knew, you'd tell me, wouldn't you?"
Tom is likely to be here tomorrow.
"I called you three or four times, but you never answered your phone."
You never return my calls.
Didn't you know that Tom was in Boston?
Why isn't Tom sleeping?
I don't care where we eat dinner. It's entirely up to you.
This photo was taken by Tom.
Is everyone OK?
Can I go to Boston with you?
Didn't you know that Tom passed away about three years ago?
I have bad eyesight.
Neither Tom nor I did that.
I'd like to walk a bit slower.
This is a lemon tree.
In Japan we have a lot of rain in June.
"Come on, I'll give you a ride."
I wasn't satisfied with the results.
I want you to think about it.
Can Tom play the guitar?
That worked.
"Reluctantly, Tom left the room."
I was scared half to death.
It's for us.
The idea was good.
Tom knew Mary was likely to be late.
I think Tom needs to go.
I'd like to live in Boston someday.
She was there in the morning.
"Tom wants to stay, but Mary wants to leave."
This machine consumes 10% of all the power we use.
I don't think that I'm stubborn.
He has a Picasso.
I can speak a little French.
I want to go abroad next year.
Let's stick with the plan.
Are you alive?
I received a letter from my brother.
It's already too late for that.
We were absent.
I hope you'll like it.
He comes here every three days.
Tom doesn't like the way Mary treats John.
He wrote a novel about vampires.
Tom is too young to drive.
Land reform caused a great change in the lives of the people.
I know that that sounds naive.
Do you think this is normal?
We spent the night in a cheap hotel.
It is a lot of fun to drive a car.
You can only choose one.
Take control.
Tom doesn't even know how to start a lawn mower.
Shut up! You're talking too much.
I'm offering Tom a job.
Has the performance started yet?
I said I'd do that.
Tom convinced me that Mary was innocent.
The effect of the medicine was amazing.
I was very glad to hear the news.
Do you know why Tom wasn't at school today?
When do you want to go?
We are men.
I knew Tom would have a great time.
Tom is very patriotic.
He doesn't remember anything.
Tom is the best player on the team.
Tom is naked.
Don't say things like that.
Tom kept yelling.
Can you clean the mess up?
Tom called the hotel.
Can I help?
How did the party go?
I had a lot of fun playing tennis with Tom.
Tom has won the last three races.
It is four centimeters thick.
Is it possible to land a plane on this island?
We saw them yesterday.
Coal is a fossil fuel.
I just kept going.
Classes will resume Monday.
I even wrote a speech just in case I was asked to give one.
I want Tom to do that.
I want to get out of here.
Aren't you surprised that Tom did that?
Let's pretend we're busy.
Stay in the house.
I have an apple.
Tom wore gloves.
What's happened to you?
Tell me where to go.
I hope that that doesn't happen.
Tom said this belonged to him.
"Two, four, six and eight are even numbers."
I let you down.
I wrote him a letter asking him to come home soon.
My brother is in Australia now.
I can't think of life without you.
I am so exhausted!
Tom says he doesn't want to ask Mary for help.
I do not have much time.
I'm surprised that Tom doesn't have a girlfriend.
Why are you at home?
Tom told me you won.
Tom knew something was wrong with Mary.
Tom only did half of his homework.
Tom doesn't want to wait that long.
You know how much I hate cooking.
What a fool I was!
I know that most people here don't like doing that.
He hung his coat on a hook.
Didn't you go out?
Do you need to go anywhere else?
Tom said Mary wasn't very strong.
Which sport do you like the most?
Where would you like to go next summer?
Tom looks younger than you.
Tom waited for the bus.
We should sing together again sometime.
I'm not good at singing.
I can't believe I forgot.
No one can separate them.
The United States Ambassador in Syria left the country for security reasons.
Tom really likes French.
Am I that predictable?
Put on your hat.
"Oh, take your time. I'm in no hurry."
I thought that Tom could lend Mary some money.
What do you think is the best film that you have seen this year?
You should come back immediately.
Where should I pick the tickets up?
I don't know which to choose.
You didn't mention that on the phone.
Where exactly did you go?
Music is a universal language.
I said I'd be there.
Do you know who they arrested?
Tom is a banker.
Tom won't apologize.
Tom is not as tall as Mary.
That's how Tom did that.
I've made an interesting discovery.
I really appreciate your help.
My father finally learned to drive when he was fifty.
The sun is shining in the sky.
I know a lot of people who can play golf.
He was passing by on his bicycle when he heard a cry for help.
I tried in vain to deal with the problem.
I'd decided not to do that anymore.
We know that's never going to happen.
I thought about it a lot.
Is that what you're afraid of?
I didn't want to say anything in front of Tom.
We didn't want to hurt you.
Please open it.
Isn't that great?
I've seen these pictures.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
He said that he had a lot of money.
We were caught in a storm.
Tom doesn't want to talk with you.
You probably want to be alone.
Your lips are red.
I may be gone for a while.
We could've helped you.
"I don't know how, but I did it."
Tom opened the box.
Tom could've run away.
I think you're next.
The damage is done.
My sister's going to kill me.
He needn't have come himself.
I don't want to change anything.
Tom speaks French perfectly.
"Because of the pills I took, the pain went away."
Our plan will call for a lot of money.
Switch it on.
I told you that would work.
I haven't apologized yet.
The problem was difficult to solve.
They organized a political party.
You put too much sugar in the tea.
They're worried.
Why did you cancel your trip?
I don't want to do anything that might be dangerous.
I wanted Tom to learn French.
I took a taxi because the bus was late.
I bought the car at a 10% discount.
I know a lot of people who can't ride a bicycle.
He is deeply attached to her.
She came back an hour later.
You're just like your father.
She is a woman of great beauty.
I can do a lot of things.
I've lost my keys.
We just got here.
You must not yield to temptation.
She could die.
Tell me about your plan.
Green suits you.
Tom has been waiting for you all morning.
"Tom smiled at Mary, but she didn't smile back."
Tom is six foot tall.
Could we not talk about this?
Tom must be missing Mary.
Do you like to watch TV?
"It's important, don't you think?"
"I want to stay, but Tom wants to go home."
Tom died alone.
It is just your imagination.
Have you been listening to me?
I don't want to go back to jail.
Will you go out tomorrow?
I hate that so much.
Stay away from the window.
Tom paints best in oil.
The prospects for Japan's future look dismal.
I'd like to sleep a little bit longer.
Tom is a good team player.
Tom and Mary had strong feelings for each other.
I couldn't figure out what he was talking about.
Tom's eyes were red.
Tom is calling us a taxi.
You didn't give me any alternative.
I'll be brief.
Tom was trying to escape.
Tom's interesting.
Tom got up from his stool.
The doctor gave me a shot.
He knows other and easier ways of getting what he desires.
Don't do anything that you might regret later.
Why aren't you saying anything?
Tom was grateful for your help.
Quitting smoking is one of the best things that you can do to improve overall health and extend life expectancy.
Tom said he was unhappy.
May I borrow your bike?
Tom has a criminal record.
Who was that guy?
I didn't say I would help you.
He will be ten next April.
Thank you for choosing us.
We didn't buy it.
My room is number five.
Do you really want to talk about Tom?
You may go home now.
We have a slight problem.
Do you know why Tom left Boston?
I don't even know what that means.
I want to stop thinking about this.
He dislikes me.
Don't be cruel to animals.
I don't feel like studying right now.
Tell Tom it's urgent.
Do you have an umbrella?
I'm already on the train.
Why don't we go dancing?
I already saw it.
Don't believe people who claim that they know everything.
We're not living together.
You're stronger than Tom.
I already have plans for this weekend.
Are you sure Tom knows what he's doing?
I have plenty of time.
I can't believe I agreed to this.
Tom didn't want anybody to find out about him and Mary.
Your car handles easily.
I've already told you that I don't know how to do that.
Is the gas turned on?
You must start immediately.
Please stay as long as you want.
You shouldn't have told them.
We were glad to hear of his safe return.
Tom got wet to the skin.
You should try to learn a little French.
It's cold out here.
I don't do that very often.
I've always wanted to visit another planet.
How did he find us?
I would've come even if you hadn't invited me.
The first step is the most important step.
The girl has golden hair.
He is about to leave.
Don't apologize.
We weren't prepared for what happened.
Hippopotamuses are agressive and unpredictable.
Tom has done nothing to be ashamed of.
I'll be here waiting for you.
Tom doesn't like the music I listen to.
She always reminds me of her mother.
"You'll pay for this, Tom."
Is that someone's name?
You didn't even smile.
Where are you all going so early in the morning?
It was terrorism.
Tom thinks he's smarter than me.
I saw a town in the distance.
What did I say wrong?
You really need to get a haircut.
Tom and Mary are talking on the phone.
I thought that Tom didn't have a driver's license.
We paid for it.
I don't want him to get into trouble.
Help me move this couch.
Tom knew that Mary wanted to win.
Tom forgave Mary for losing all his money.
They're not so bad.
You're cheating.
"Unfortunately, I wasn't able to keep my promise."
This bridge won't hold the weight of our car.
Do you have a fireplace in your home?
His mother died four years later.
I've come to ask you a favor.
Tom wants to play tennis with Mary.
The food here is terrible.
Tom voted against you.
Someone called.
No one was helping us.
Why don't you want me to help you?
Nothing would persuade him.
Please correct that.
You don't have to explain.
I'll be really careful.
My plane leaves at six o'clock.
I bought two loaves of bread.
I screamed.
I had no idea anything was wrong.
Perhaps I expected too much from Tom.
I don't want to stay home.
Tom said Mary was beautiful.
The tiles that fell from the roof broke into very small pieces.
Bring a camera.
Somebody farted in the elevator.
How did I not know about this?
They won't let you go.
I'm surprised that you won the prize.
How old is this dog?
You ought not to go out.
Tom has a weak heart.
I'm hammered.
You're all dressed up. Where are you going?
I knew it was time to leave.
Do you have a map of Boston?
Watch your step.
It was just your imagination.
Show us what you're capable of.
Tom should've told Mary the truth.
You can't die if you're already dead.
I have to help Tom do that.
Tom told Mary never to do that again.
Tell Tom I've gone fishing.
Tell me how you did it.
I didn't know you had a sense of humor.
I needed to talk to Tom.
I go there as often as I can.
I'm glad you're OK.
I didn't need it.
"Tom gave Mary a box of chocolates and one long-stemmed rose for her birthday. ""That's really sweet."""
He still lives with his parents.
We already did that.
I don't like the way you talk to me.
You said you were thirty.
Tom told me that he intended to go to Boston with Mary.
Everybody seems to be happy.
Allow me to explain.
Did you read all of it?
I've heard that Tom asked you to marry him.
Do your parents speak French?
Tom is the one who gave this to me.
How did you know I had a dog?
I wouldn't mind doing it again.
How can you say that our soldiers died in vain?
Is this your locker?
Both of you are wrong.
Tom told Mary to go back to her room.
We'll be here all day.
Tom scared the living daylights out of me.
I'll consult with Tom.
Jose is lactose intolerant.
Are you dying?
I was just pulling your leg.
Were you able to help Tom?
"After his bankruptcy, he wasn't able to get back on his feet."
Tom was sent to prison.
I hope that's true.
You're going to like working for me.
It's our turn.
Are you getting along with your neighbors?
What were you just doing?
I got you some coffee.
It's cold outside.
You should treat people with more respect.
They say they cannot compete with low-priced foreign products.
Are you going with me?
Don't be an idiot.
Why do you ask?
Tom really wants to help.
It's yours.
Are you alone now?
What did you take?
I want you to get off my back.
Tom doesn't know anything about fishing.
I don't think Tom will be able to walk for two or three days.
Tom doesn't have to worry about me.
All the stones have been moved.
Let's write a book.
Who cut your hair?
Tom wasn't at school on October 20th.
You'll see.
His grandfather bought him the expensive toy.
Tom has long brown hair.
I didn't understand Tom's explanation.
I know Tom is a very good driver.
Am I what you expected?
I may have no choice.
You should've listened to me.
"Unfortunately, it's a hoax."
Are you hiding something from me?
You can't hide the fact from her.
I'm used to drinking coffee without sugar.
How was your test?
I think Tom likes Mary.
Tom should be home by now.
We took advantage of the fine weather to play tennis.
We're alone here.
Is Tom still at work?
I can be patient.
You can't park here.
My parents love me.
Which one do you like better?
Do you know what else is wrong?
He died three years ago.
Did anyone else notice this?
I was hoping we wouldn't have to go.
When are you going to finish this?
The train has already gone.
"If I'm late, don't wait for me."
I think Tom should've stayed in Boston.
Tom hasn't had anything to eat since breakfast.
He's out now.
We are all happy to help.
They didn't feel like playing any more.
God bless you!
You were meant for me.
Tom didn't eat lunch with us.
Tom will definitely not win.
We're here to help Tom.
I'm used to it.
Tom followed Mary into the kitchen.
Tom was raised near Boston.
How much kerosene is left in the tank?
I think Tom won't be able to win.
Tom could do with some help.
"I stayed at the hotel, but the others went shopping."
I thought you didn't want to go.
Tom didn't seem surprised when I told him Mary wasn't here.
You look tired. You ought to rest for an hour or two.
I'm being treated like a child.
"Weather permitting, we are going to get to the top of the mountain tomorrow."
We need to figure out what went wrong.
We can't blame anyone else.
Tom will be in Australia for the next three weeks.
Where's your passport?
We can begin.
I didn't know you cooked.
"I didn't know you needed one, too."
I would like to ask a favor of you.
What's the cause?
Didn't you know what time the meeting was going to start?
I know it's here somewhere.
Eat anything you want.
They know what happened.
The message was for you.
She turned 16 years old.
Come to my office any time.
Everybody already knew that.
"Feeling chilly, I turned on the heater."
Tom said that Mary likes you.
I don't know who I am.
I saw one today.
Tom and I know why you were crying.
Tom nearly killed both of them.
Didn't you know Tom liked to go fishing?
"By helping you, we're helping ourselves."
Why are you sitting there?
I can't believe Tom has gone.
I don't know anything about raising children.
You need to go to the hospital.
I think Tom would've helped us if he'd been here.
I can fix it.
He whittled the stick to a sharp point with his hunting knife.
He has spent most of his working life as a diplomat.
I know you did that on purpose.
Many children learn to use a computer even before entering school.
Does this look good on me?
I will survive.
I promise you I'll help Tom.
I made a reservation at our favorite restaurant.
Even Tom didn't need to do that.
I just had a nightmare.
What's the longest French word you know?
I need to talk to Tom again.
They're married.
"No matter what happens, I'll always love you."
Birds make their nests in trees.
Please don't wait for me.
I've already told you I'm busy.
I'm a little shy.
Tom said he was mistaken.
I don't want the ring.
Stand still!
I apologize if I offended you.
My brother uses this bike.
Did you say 30?
We both love each other.
I'm glad that Tom didn't win.
Where do I turn?
Why is Tom still in Boston?
I have a meeting at 2:30.
I'm Tom's father.
"Hey, don't worry."
What's Tom doing?
"If you can't sleep, try counting sheep."
You'd better do what we told you to do.
Light refreshments will be served.
Do you have something to say?
I don't think that Tom hates you.
We leave in three hours.
Tom reads nothing but fiction.
We're still the best in the world.
I almost dropped a plate.
Do you think we'll win?
Tom said that he didn't want to dance.
You don't want that.
What gives?
You're objective.
"Great weather, isn't it?"
When did she send you her pictures?
My head still hurts.
Is there anything we can do to help?
I'd like to see you.
She understands you now.
"If it rains tomorrow, we won't go."
"If you have a question, please ask me."
I use Google every day.
Everybody knows their own name.
The police don't think it was an accident.
Should I continue?
No one's died so far.
I tried to kiss Mary.
I haven't finished breakfast yet.
I've just arrived at the airport.
I knew they were your friends.
I always get home by six o'clock.
She doesn't understand you.
Why are you all laughing?
Why don't you call a spade a spade?
He's a yes-man.
Tom says that he's happy.
How do you make a box?
She can sing better than anybody else in her class.
What does your job entail?
The bus will be here in five minutes.
Were you alone?
I'll go when I'm ready.
I was waiting for the bus.
They kept the information about the military operations a secret.
We're all inexperienced.
That will not change.
Where is your money?
It's their anniversary.
What's your decision?
You had no choice but to do it.
How did your parents meet?
I wonder whether Tom is asleep.
Did anybody notice this?
I didn't even know Tom had a girlfriend.
I heard Tom was looking for me.
I suspect that Tom can do that without any help.
What does that have to do with anything?
Tom wants to study medicine.
Don't buy things on credit.
Please don't let Tom drive.
Tom stood behind me.
Does this bus go to the beach?
This is exactly what I wanted.
You should have told him about it while he was here.
Tom told me that Mary wasn't retired.
I hope we have good weather tomorrow.
Tom talked about what had happened.
She spent some time in Boston.
What are your plans for Christmas?
How much will we have to pay?
I paid Tom.
I have to win.
Tom isn't greedy.
Tom will learn how to do that sooner or later.
I could swim well when I was a child.
Tom hid his knife under the mattress.
I've already spoken to Tom.
What kind of wood is this table made of?
Do I have to write a letter?
Tom won't find out.
I did everything I could to stop Tom.
Who did you learn it from?
That's just what he needed.
Tom fed his leftovers to his dog.
Would it bother you if I smoke?
I'll lend you some books to read.
Our lives are in your hands.
Tom and Mary have been friends since high school.
Would you mind watching my kids?
I can lend you some money if you need some.
I see it every day.
We almost got caught a few times.
They look surprised.
I need a bigger box.
Can you tell me how it happened?
Who invented the clipboard?
I was born in Australia.
Now is the time to act.
I went to the beach.
Tom decided not to do it.
My aunt made a new skirt for me.
I can't make any exceptions.
You can always change it.
Everybody knew Tom was the one who did that.
Don't tell anybody.
The police found Tom's car at the airport.
You can vote by absentee ballot.
Tom has never written to me.
Tom asked Mary to quit her job.
Tom lived alone in a small cabin.
Are you sure you're not tired?
I couldn't fix it.
Tom likes wearing expensive clothes.
Tom repaired my watch for me.
Please put that on the table.
I'm about to leave.
Is Tom ill?
I'm feeling pretty confident.
Tom doesn't seem to agree.
He is good at playing tennis.
The wall is partly covered with ivy.
Japan is not what it was 15 years ago.
I never liked her.
I missed you.
"I didn't use to like wine, but now I like it a lot."
Tom is engaged to my daughter.
Tom knew the reason.
Would you mind leaving the room?
How many times have you been to Europe?
Climate change is not a hoax.
I'm sure I won't like it.
Someone is watching you.
Tom is a lot smarter than I am.
The pen is broken.
Tom told Mary he needed her help.
I think you're right about that.
I don't know who to ask for advice.
Maybe we could make a deal.
Basketball is a lot of fun to play.
No one ate the cake.
The outcome of the upcoming election will be the hardest ever to predict.
Tom and I'll do our best.
He is very sensitive to cold.
Can you fix my car?
I knew you'd protect me.
I wish you luck.
It's not like Tom to get so angry.
Tom finally arrived at 2:30.
Why do they do this?
He's in danger of being evicted.
Tom went to Boston. Everyone else went to Chicago.
It has nothing to do with Tom.
Tom felt awkward.
The criminal confessed.
I'll never see you again.
Tom didn't even apologize to Mary.
Tom always wanted a daughter.
You said you were going to buy a new car.
Come at ten o'clock sharp.
We're ready for them.
"Tom said that he was sick, but that was a lie."
Tom was just doing what he needed to do.
He's stupid and arrogant.
Tom put down his suitcase.
I really have to talk to Tom.
That's not Tom. That's John.
My mother gets up early.
I knew that Tom wasn't going to change.
She is collecting material for a book.
What exactly did you say?
You should wash new sheets before using them.
It's a pipe dream.
I'm not absolutely sure.
Don't give anyone else this number.
Tom wants you to help him do that.
You're wealthy.
Anybody can learn French.
She's on a diet.
Her father left her the house in his will.
Tom doesn't need to apologize. He did nothing wrong.
Do you think they noticed?
Tom has big hands.
They were made of rough brown leather.
Tom said his team would win.
I need to find my pen.
Please sign this receipt.
I still haven't paid you.
My mother is busy in the kitchen.
Can I do that myself?
I felt that I should apologize.
You were too young.
You should know this.
They replaced the defective TV with a new one.
Mary is just an average girl.
You should've never come here.
I leave in an hour.
I don't know when Tom was born.
Tom lost his friends.
"Now that I'm older, my opinions on this matter have changed."
Why don't you join in the conversation?
You are beautiful.
I promise that I'll pay you back the money I owe you before the end of the month.
I thought he was coming.
Do you want a glass of milk?
Tom never told me why he didn't like Mary.
I am no match for him.
Have you forgotten everything we've done for you?
Tom has scurvy.
I wish I hadn't gone to that party.
You must be very hungry.
Don't turn off your computer.
We've decided to do that.
How much can we take?
Everyone started laughing at me.
That's extremely dangerous.
I know Tom is a librarian.
I went out to eat.
It's been stolen.
Tom is better at doing that than Mary is.
I don't eat the core of an apple.
I'm going to give you one more chance.
Tell me where Tom took Mary.
Tell Tom I'm not here.
The church is still standing. Everything else was destroyed.
Hasn't Tom started yet?
Let sleeping dogs lie.
I have no desire to stay here.
I like that description.
Don't walk out on me again.
Do you live by yourself?
Tom is going to be next.
Tom is mean to everybody.
When did you come to Japan?
Tom doesn't deserve punishment.
We don't have any chance of winning.
You need written permission.
Tom told Mary he was going to leave Boston.
I completely agree with Tom.
Just be careful with Tom.
Have a drink with us.
What's your favorite color of lipstick?
It's useless to talk to Tom.
I'd better go home.
Did Tom faint?
Are your parents still in Boston?
Bring him to me.
Tom loved Mary.
He did all the legwork.
That river floods every year.
I don't think that anyone else noticed what Tom was doing.
It'll take months.
I started crying like a baby.
"Tom didn't want to come here, but he came anyway."
I'm different.
Tom told Mary that he was sad.
A river divides the town.
It's gravity that makes satellites move around the Earth.
I guess I'll wait till Tom gets here.
Tom died in my arms.
Murder is against the law.
Stop singing.
He exposed himself to the ridicule of his classmates.
You alluded to something else.
Nobody knew Tom wasn't a Canadian.
I was working.
All the tickets are sold out.
I'll forgive you.
Her name is known to everyone.
They did not have much food to eat.
I didn't come by taxi.
Tom may be a few minutes late.
I came here when I was four.
No one listens to me.
Tom didn't struggle.
Airplanes land at airports.
I don't think that would be a good idea.
I don't think that we need to wait for Tom.
Tom has told me not to do that.
Didn't you know Tom used to teach French in Boston?
Tom has a silk scarf.
Everyone knows that we love Tom.
I thought Tom was your friend.
Tom sleeps on his back.
Idaho is famous for potatoes.
I want to thank you for all your help.
I don't think Tom knows Mary very well.
"I didn't want to tell Tom the truth, but I did."
Tom and Mary are the ones who did that.
What I want right now is a hot cup of coffee.
It's all quite normal.
Why are you always doing that?
The river overflowed.
I won't tolerate disobedience.
Stop singing.
She came in with tears in her eyes.
This must stop.
Let's ditch these people and go home.
I'll go to Tom's place tomorrow.
I just got home half an hour ago.
Tom said that he was sick.
I'll show you exactly where I found this.
I think I would've heard the door open if Tom had come in.
Tom's hands were tied behind his back.
Who's Tom having dinner with?
I think you'll miss me when I'm gone.
I haven't had a day off in a long time.
I'm afraid we must go if we want to get home before dark.
Do you want to talk about that?
It's been a stressful day.
How do you know this car is Tom's?
Tom filled the bathtub with water.
I hate fireworks.
I know it's hard to do that.
I have a better idea. Let's order a pizza and stay here.
When was the last time that you had a headache?
Tom approached them.
Do you know anything about Tom's family?
What should I name it?
"He works as a teacher, but actually he is a spy."
Have we understood each other?
I see a bird on the roof.
Look at Tom.
I don't know when Tom met Mary.
You're the best dad in the world.
I couldn't get in.
There isn't much wind today.
Tom doesn't know when Mary will come.
Tom won't wear that.
Tom never mentioned it again.
Tom slept on an inflatable mattress.
Tom will be OK.
Tom said that the team needed a new captain.
They crossed the border into Spain.
Fill out this form.
I haven't seen that movie yet.
She is less intelligent than you.
You almost killed me.
I've learned a lot about Tom.
Someone stole my wallet.
The days are longer in the summer.
A great many people attended his funeral.
My hands and feet always feel cold.
Are you waiting for a bus?
Do you know anything about that?
Tom switched off his walkie-talkie.
Stand up!
You only need to concentrate.
My back still hurts.
Tom changed.
It'll be known sooner or later.
You look really great.
It was a hard day.
You can help me.
Aren't you sleepy?
It happened again.
I was going to make cookies for Tom.
We've all left early.
Who should I contact?
Tom will never see you again.
Tom has been demoted.
I find you very attractive.
What if Tom starts asking questions?
I have to clean up my apartment.
I want to buy a new camera.
You should apologize to Tom for what you said.
Truth is more important than beauty.
Should I tell Tom to ask Mary to do that?
That is the shop where I used to work.
I hate shopping.
Why are you so sad?
Tom is honest.
Tie the horse to that tree.
I've never been in prison.
The concert was awful.
Did Tom ever tell you what Mary looked like?
Are you insane?
I don't have to do that today.
I am afraid of dogs.
No one voted against it.
Tom doesn't have as much free time as he used to.
They made me work.
We agree.
Tom refused to tell us anything.
Sit wherever you like.
Can't you just leave me alone?
He ate a box of chocolates.
Tom drank a glass of milk.
That's why I don't like you.
You'd better not swim if you've just eaten.
Please don't do that now.
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
How do I report a theft?
I'll be leaving soon.
Tom has three cameras.
The telephone is now out of order.
The soup is too hot.
It's too risky.
Tell me what my options are.
Tom promised himself he would study French for thirty minutes every day.
Tom was alive.
Is it foggy?
Could I help you do the dishes?
This vase has been sitting on the shelf for years.
Tom knew nothing.
The food is fantastic.
Have you gone crazy?
I know a lot about you.
Tom has already been told to go home.
Tom is going in the right direction.
I'm turning thirty in October.
I think this book is worth reading.
Rome is an old city.
It's too noisy to sleep.
I saved your life.
Try this one.
I think that Tom will be in Boston next week.
That happens often enough in the summer.
What time did you get up today?
She wrote a book about animals.
This happens all the time.
Do you want to do that today?
I warned Tom.
I don't like chocolate.
You're such an idiot!
Their concern is understandable.
I'll do that with you.
I thought you didn't want to talk about this.
Are you afraid?
How much longer do I have to go to school?
Where is it now?
Do it again!
I would prefer a room with a southern exposure.
Are you impartial?
I'll take responsibility.
Tom has chosen you.
Tom is one of our former clients.
What do you want to do after lunch?
Where is my dog?
I'm looking for Tom Jackson's office.
Tom walks his dog at least once a day.
A new railroad will soon be laid here.
I was afraid of catching a cold.
Please shut the door behind you.
Tom doesn't trust Mary with his car.
You've already done the hard part.
That's not the reason that I came here.
I tried to persuade Tom to wait.
I really miss my girlfriend.
This one's for you.
I think that Tom and Mary are divorced.
Don't brake suddenly.
It isn't contagious.
There were two red hats on this table two hours ago.
Is there a MacDonald's around here?
Is this coat yours?
I don't trust you anymore.
I love that dress.
The woman suspected that her son was using drugs.
We must separate politics from religion.
I arrived at school on time.
Don't you have classes today?
Just wait there.
Tom said I was rude.
Are you done?
"No matter what happens, don't forget to smile."
I'm a smoker.
I have traveled all over Australia.
I'm never going to let you go.
Someone just turned off the lights.
Are they criminals?
He is not scared of snakes at all.
Tom just sat there and stared at Mary's picture.
I don't know what more I can do for you.
Tom wanted to turn himself in to the police.
I can't stand people like you.
You can't hate the guy.
I'm sure you'll enjoy doing that.
Can you see?
Everybody is busy except me.
Follow your desire.
You obviously want to help.
We've been together for thirty years.
Why am I still alive?
"According to her, he isn't coming."
Tom is a correctional officer.
Is Tom a good singer?
Tom doesn't want to go anywhere today.
Are you threatening me?
What did the note say?
You would make a good diplomat.
Tom has lost his mind.
Tom likes not only Mary but Alice as well.
I don't think I'm the only one here who speaks French.
He returned from Canada.
You are exactly like your mother.
My grandparents died before I was born.
I gave each boy an apple.
I suggest that you eat right now.
Tom also came.
The books in this room aren't mine.
What did Tom think of that?
The afternoon sun comes directly into my room.
Tom wasn't the one who told me to do this.
Vienna is a beautiful city.
I'm your new neighbor.
I'll find another job.
They sell things here that you can't find anywhere else.
Tom found a pen.
Tom and Mary need this.
This would never have happened if you'd stayed home.
Don't expect too much of him.
I hear everything you're saying.
Tom was three years old when his father died.
It's a pleasure to be able to help you.
I ate way too much.
Tom gave the baby a bath.
Have you ever broken a bone?
We'll have to talk about that.
Can you tell me why you want to work for us?
You just complicate the argument when you split hairs that way.
Tom is sure that it was an accident.
Did Tom accept your offer?
I hope you won't tell anyone you saw me leave this house.
It's Tom's turn to deal the cards.
I'll be back in an hour or so.
Eat a lot of vegetables.
Do you think anyone can see us?
Won't you come in for a moment?
That's one of the reasons that we're here.
Tom spent the summer in Boston.
I like jazz. What kind of music do you like?
Tom and Mary are both present.
Is that a yes?
How did you know Tom was going to go fishing today?
He is ashamed of telling lies.
We're still discussing that.
I hate watching TV.
What was stolen?
He will telephone you immediately when he comes back.
It's our own fault.
I haven't noticed any difference.
I know Tom very well.
We didn't want it.
Why don't you take a break?
We've lived like this for 30 years.
He promised he would tell us.
I asked Tom where he had been.
He won't live more than one day.
Tom doesn't want to live like that.
Tom keeps his gun in a safe.
Why did she interrupt me?
I want to take a look inside.
He took a short cut.
He's a very affectionate father.
I've worked with Tom.
Tom enjoyed working for Mary.
Did Tom tell you where he was going?
I thought Tom didn't know how to speak French.
That was all Tom knew about Mary.
Who's taking responsibility for this?
Tom didn't bother to respond.
His theory is based on fact.
We came here to buy a dress for our daughter.
Did you get robbed?
Tom became Mary's best friend.
Tom has been living with us.
I prefer to do it on my own.
"Take this one, for example."
You'll soon get used to Japanese food.
"Tomorrow, it'll be worse."
Have you betrayed me?
I'm sorry I told you.
It's good to talk to you.
They were born in Thailand.
Why are you being followed?
I could do nothing.
It's important that you tell me the truth.
How much candy did you eat?
Tom bit off more than he could chew.
"Look, I can explain."
I saw a whale tail today.
That is exactly what I wanted to buy.
Do you need help?
You are both in the wrong.
"Come on, Tom. Let's go home."
I wasn't trying to be hero.
I was on patrol.
I was very upset.
I found a dollar in the street.
I told Tom you used to live in Boston.
That coffee smells so good.
Tom lost his car keys.
Don't worry. I'll never leave you.
Where can I find Tom?
He was in the hospital for a week.
You'd better eat now.
It finally stopped raining towards evening.
Kojin Kudo is a born poet.
Tom and Mary picked up a hitchhiker.
"I'm sorry, but I don't want to talk about it."
We were caught in a snowstorm.
I never saw Tom.
"If Tom is still inside the house, then he's probably safe."
I didn't expect these results.
I regret coming to Boston.
He is not the sharpest knife in the drawer.
Tom has arthritis.
I wonder why Tom didn't stay in Boston for another week.
Tom says he never dreams.
Tom and I are going to Boston tomorrow.
One student was arrested.
You won't like it here.
We still have enough time to discuss it.
Where do you play tennis?
I may have to go to Boston.
I'm being serious.
Let's put off the decision until tomorrow.
Please go up to the third floor.
You'll be the first to know.
That sounds vaguely familiar.
I like watching planes take off.
It wasn't their idea.
I was happy there.
I'll take the stairs.
I'll become stronger.
Do you think I care what you think of me?
The stranger was too surprised to speak.
She braked hard when she saw a child run out into the road.
That's how life is.
Tell Tom I don't know where his car keys are.
Tom told me that he was hungry.
Tom convinced me that I was wrong.
Did Tom kiss Mary?
Do you really want to help?
I don't know how to contact you.
We work with what we have.
He blames his failure on bad luck.
Drinking warm milk will help you get to sleep.
I go every year.
Live and learn.
You can't just not go to work.
Does that answer your question?
What were you just thinking?
I don't see him.
I can understand that.
I don't think that Tom drank anything.
Come to my office any time.
Why did you agree to help them?
You are good.
I was a boy scout.
Tom is the one causing all the problems.
What should I do?
They burned.
A mouse went for a walk on the table.
Would you like to go to Boston with me?
Tom killed himself.
You're cheating.
Let me go with Tom.
What else can I do for you?
You must be alert.
There was no point in arguing with Tom.
Tom needs to tell Mary the truth.
Can I help with anything?
I don't want to leave Tom.
Tom and I switched seats.
I was disgusted.
What makes you think you won't be able to do it?
Stop it. You're making me blush.
"If I do that, I'll be laughed at."
Kill it.
Tom told Mary he hated her.
How many times a week do you go shopping?
How long have you been sick?
I don't think I could live with Tom.
Tom told me that he wants to meet my parents.
"It's very late, so I should already be in bed."
I always do that.
I am very unhappy.
Did you suggest that to Tom?
Being a single parent isn't easy.
It may seem strange.
I fear so.
What do you expect me to do?
"Be quiet, or the baby will wake up."
Do it for Tom and me.
It's a no-brainer.
I knew we'd win.
I recognized Tom immediately.
Tom screamed and ran out of the room.
That seems to make sense.
Are you going anywhere?
I feel like an amoeba.
This is the house where she used to live.
But I don't want to.
I liked the old system better.
They're doing OK.
Keep your money in a safe place.
Don't cheat.
Life is not perfect.
They don't know about it.
I wanted to thank you for everything you've done for me.
This book seems easy to me.
Tom doesn't want you to know the truth.
I know you'll like Tom.
I heard a little girl crying.
I know Tom is afraid.
Tom is going away for a month.
I have a hangover.
We never had that opportunity.
I'm not interested in science fiction.
Tom won't even notice.
That's the most beautiful ship I've ever seen.
I know that Tom is a special kid.
Tom ripped out the page.
You never say thank you.
Let's share the expenses.
They are listening to the radio.
Tom is probably going to come.
Tom led a simple life.
I can take Tom.
Tom didn't know that Mary could understand French.
I need another blanket.
They don't sell it.
Tom couldn't do this alone.
We're not kidding.
Mary was playing hard to get.
I didn't want to frighten you.
It wouldn't help.
Tom has been living here since he was a kid.
It's definitely Tom.
We'll go home.
Would you mind if I went out for a while?
Let's find Tom.
What time's your flight?
My brother has no money.
You've got 24 hours.
Tom has been bitten.
I'm glad that you succeeded.
I didn't run away from home.
Don't forget to call your parents.
Tom asked Mary not to go there by herself.
I know that you lied.
He came to my house.
I felt powerless.
I totally forgot.
They haven't done anything wrong.
Go upstairs right now and clean your room.
I want to be a teacher when I grow up.
I hate this place.
Where did Tom get this car?
You look like an imbecile.
What does the doctor want me to eat?
"Is this your first time in Australia? ""Yes, this is my first time here."""
Thank you for waiting.
The news upset me.
We can meet next week if you want.
Can you honestly tell me you didn't know this was going to happen?
Tom explained how he lost his money.
Tom seemed to have recognized me.
Ignore it.
"Would your name be Tom, by any chance?"
I already told you that she isn't here.
We could do it together.
Tom said that Mary wasn't hungry.
We'll be there in thirty minutes.
Tom ate lunch with Mary.
I don't want any help.
What was the final score in today's game?
Who lives here?
Tom got angry when he found the door locked.
Tom is richer than Mary.
I think you're a genius.
It won't budge.
Summer vacation is soon.
We're still moving.
We have to allow for the delay of the train.
Why was Tom doing that?
I don't mind washing the dishes.
Is this the problem?
Tom is eating oysters.
What do you usually do?
I feel good today.
Tom is angry with me.
It was an excellent game.
Who knows what you saw?
Your brother wasn't at school today.
Franklin Roosevelt became president in 1933.
Don't ask me to explain it.
Tom asked Mary where she was born.
Tom is coming closer.
Where will you have lunch today?
There isn't going to be a change.
Tom will eventually learn to do that.
Tom didn't move.
Don't you like fishing?
Tom said he felt great.
I wanted you to know.
"Unfortunately, I broke my leg, so I can't go skiing with you this weekend."
I'd like to buy a round-trip ticket to Boston.
I don't know what Tom will do.
She had a perfect alibi.
I'd like to meet Tom's father.
This isn't a new car.
We don't like you.
He ran away when he saw me.
Tom was sitting behind me.
It must be Tom.
Don't come back here.
Tom asked me not to help him.
Tom loves gardening.
I wanted to give you a chance.
Anything will do.
Everyone noticed.
I helped Tom clean his room.
I am a married man.
Tell me the reason why they are absent.
Tom knew it was a mistake.
I may stay here until Monday.
I thought you were going to kill me.
Can you smell that?
Tom wouldn't tell me where he'd been.
Don't sleep too close to the fire.
That's why I didn't do that.
The surgery was a success.
This is all I've got.
I need something to open this bottle with.
The train was late this morning.
"Sorry, my mistake."
Don't forget to call your mom.
Isn't that where we first met?
Tom is insolent.
Let's give Tom another chance.
She is easygoing.
I'm still sick.
Tom passed out because of the heat.
Tom always takes Mary's part in an argument.
I didn't think that Tom liked to ski.
We're all impressed.
Get out of the way.
I probably won't change my mind.
Tom is very angry with his children.
We're going to finish this.
"You can't win, Tom."
I wish you'd been there.
I pretended that I was sleeping.
I don't want to shoot you.
Ten dimes are equal to one dollar.
Trust your intuition.
Why did that surprise you?
We must leave immediately.
Don't let them see you.
You cook better than I do.
Tom and Mary are having an argument.
Tell Tom I'm innocent.
I blame Tom.
Tell me what you have.
You said you'd help.
It's Tom calling from Boston.
It was their fault.
The new supermarket was opened last month.
I don't see a problem with this.
Tell me where I can find it.
Tom said he was just interested in helping Mary.
What a pain!
Tom won't know who to give it to.
There were no stores in the Yukon.
She picked me an apple.
Go to the park.
Do you want to pray?
Which way is the elevator?
How much time did you need for that?
He ran out of the room in anger.
He's the one who told me about that.
Maybe he won't become famous.
How much time do I have?
Lightning hit that tower.
I thought I'd left it at home.
We'll bring Tom home.
I didn't know that what I'd done was against the law.
Tom isn't accustomed to working at night.
Who told you about me?
You know I don't like eggs.
Give me your phone.
Tom isn't very concerned about that.
Do you still hate French?
I hope it's worth it.
I'm really glad I moved to Boston.
Tom didn't take part in the marathon.
I'd never do something like that.
I'm not looking forward to seeing Tom.
Michael Jackson has died.
I don't think Tom is a loser.
Tom's father is in prison.
I want to be more independent.
Stay here.
I didn't catch the last word.
Tom decided to go to Boston.
He's always late to meetings.
I hope we didn't keep you waiting too long.
I don't want to get out of bed.
I've seen Tom swim.
The prisoners are escaping!
I like to do everything for myself.
Tom is the only one here who has never lived in Boston.
Do you think I'm bluffing?
"If you don't understand, ask."
Tom thought that Mary would be glad to see him.
The boy was lying on his stomach watching TV.
What is it you like about Tom?
I didn't know you were back.
It looks like you're bored.
Tom said he needed to get some sleep.
Nobody cares what you think.
This chair isn't very comfortable.
Tom and Mary must be very hungry.
African elephants have less hair than Asian elephants.
Wild animals live in the jungle.
I want to thank you for what you've done for me.
Give me the gun.
It wasn't always like that.
Tom is waiting for Mary.
I'm dying of thirst.
Tom is a little odd.
I wish I had more time to talk to her.
I need some writing paper.
Tom wants me on his team.
Tom picked up the remote control.
I think I've heard enough.
Why do I need a lawyer?
I thought that she was pregnant.
I want you to be with me.
Tom terrified Mary.
I'm disgusted.
I leave that to you.
Put your suitcase over here.
No one believed you.
You must be strong.
Everyone knew that but me.
Tom likes oranges.
I'm not taking the bus.
Tom probably isn't hungry.
Put the book where you found it.
Do you want to go fishing?
Don't be angry with me.
You have no sense of direction.
We must move this statue very carefully.
I know it's time to leave.
All the guests have gone home.
"Now that you know what the problem is, how long do you think it'll take to fix it?"
You're too slow.
Why are you scared of me?
Tom thought I was Mary's boyfriend.
Tom didn't apologize to Mary for doing that.
It's sprinkling outside.
Don't lie to Tom.
Please find out where he is.
Why didn't Tom wait?
Tom is just looking for trouble.
I will give you this book.
"If Tom doesn't want to go, he doesn't have to."
I think this translation is incorrect.
Tom is coming to Boston with us.
I don't think I can find the time to do that today.
I'll call him tonight.
I didn't see Tom coming.
I'll need some time.
Tom wanted to understand why Mary didn't like him.
This might take a few minutes.
We're both moving to Boston.
My heart's beating so fast!
That was a good idea.
Tom and Mary hugged each other.
You never told me you had a sister.
Put it down.
I knew you'd be angry.
Tom says that he'll come tomorrow.
I just found Tom. He's dead.
Maybe we can help.
Tom is only pretending that he doesn't know.
Why would I want that?
I've never tasted anything as unusual as this.
Tom ducked his head.
You're unforgettable.
Tom doesn't want to be seen here.
I found this movie very interesting.
You're not normal.
I don't think that Tom knows that I'm Canadian.
Tom seems to be running out of ideas.
It's good you were able to come.
That's a big step.
Tom and I work in the same office.
That's why I left Boston.
You're too busy.
Tom's room is locked.
I just didn't believe you.
It is like looking for a needle in a haystack.
"Where do you want to go, then?"
Tom looks a lot older than Mary.
Let's take a break for lunch.
Tell Tom not to worry.
Stop fighting!
It's difficult to understand his ideas.
You didn't even tell me Tom had died.
I think I should talk to Tom myself.
We'd like to climb that mountain.
Tom found Mary's house without difficulty.
He can scarcely write his name.
Tom went back to school.
Did anyone take my book?
I'd like to know what you think.
Tell me why you were absent from school yesterday.
I'm trying to understand you.
What else can it be?
Why do you always wear that hat?
I was out shopping.
Tom stole my idea.
May I ask where you work?
Tom is shy.
I trusted you and Tom.
There's one more thing we have to do.
Stop there.
Do you know where Tom is now?
The leaves on trees have turned red.
The policeman saved the child from drowning.
Did Tom leave something here for me?
They finally left.
We're leaving in five minutes.
Did anybody ask Tom why he did it?
I'm trying to be fair.
It's Tom's problem now.
It isn't Tom's fault.
Tom is still in bed.
We're always going to be here.
That would be risky.
We get on well together.
Mary is working as a model.
I was surprised to hear the news.
I didn't finish my homework.
I can't believe you're involved in this.
I'll never forgive you for doing that.
I thought Tom would never show up.
She waited for him for hours.
Give me a day or two.
Could we go faster? I'm late.
The experiment failed.
How will you be celebrating?
Is that OK now?
It was difficult for Tom to do that.
I'm not certain that I can trust Tom.
He's often late for work.
Did you get your money back?
What's the password?
I got first place.
When did the war end?
The computer is a relatively recent invention.
Did you honestly think Tom would come?
Everybody asks me that.
I'm afraid of my mother.
It's very dark in there.
Who elected you?
Help yourself to something.
Tom wanted to sit next to Mary.
I wanted to get married. You're the one who didn't.
Was your father right?
Good health is more valuable than anything else.
I'm not leaving here until I talk to Tom.
Tom was just as scared as Mary was.
I know that that's who you're looking for.
One is red and the other is white.
I understood Tom's point of view.
Tom walks with a cane.
I want to learn a new language.
I can't believe I just said that!
Did you smile?
Did Tom do what you asked him to do?
Everybody lies.
I didn't ask anything.
I almost missed the bus.
Tom adores you.
Is this your bicycle?
We aren't blaming you.
How many classes do you have on Monday?
Who's speaking?
I've already seen it.
Tom knew that Mary was dead.
Tom smells horrible.
Tom went to school yesterday.
We're going to be here all day.
I hope Tom comes.
Tom hung up angrily.
She's just a child.
My hand itches.
I don't have a plan.
Do you think Tom has any chance of winning?
We can't complain.
Maybe you should go to Boston.
Tom didn't pay for it.
You talk in your sleep.
You're young and naive.
How deep is the lake?
I thought you might be interested in knowing.
Tom used to be poor.
Tom immediately began crying again.
I can't believe you did all this without any help.
Why are you so good at chess?
Remember that time is money.
Keeping a diary is a good habit.
I did the best I could.
It's far from over.
Tom buttoned his shirt.
I'm afraid of hospitals.
"You never listen, no matter how many times I tell you."
They are watching a movie.
I'm tired. It's been a long day.
I want you to bring it to me.
You don't fool us.
It's almost three o'clock.
Have you always lived here?
Did you ask the price?
I knew you wouldn't wait for me.
I don't want to forget Tom.
That's cool.
We're leaving next year.
Tom told me to drive.
We should discuss this in private.
Which one do you like?
What is the latest news?
"Hey, did anybody lose their keys?"
Anyone can do it.
Tom knows I'll call you.
I'll go see if Tom is OK.
He is well read in English literature.
Why didn't you go to the police?
She wants me to go with her.
Tom says he wants to help you.
Let me tell you about Tom.
Can he play the piano?
How many Christmas cards did you get last year?
Don't listen to her.
I'm afraid the rumor is true.
You're just envious.
"I saw Tom, but I didn't see Mary."
I told you I'm fine.
The prisoners themselves could say nothing.
Almost all the work is done now.
Don't worry about the results.
Do you still have feelings for her?
We need more soap.
I'll never forget what you've done for me.
Stop acting like a baby.
The alarm sounded.
Please do so.
Tom wrote down Mary's phone number.
I thought I told you not to come.
Tom can stay with me.
Tom is the one who called 911.
You may leave if you want.
Please watch closely.
Have you ever had these symptoms before?
He has been gaining weight.
How do you know what's real?
I should never have trusted them.
I don't think I should ask Tom to do that for us.
"He drove the car, listening to music on the radio."
I've got to see you.
"Tom doesn't want you to go, does he?"
Tom recently had surgery.
I want you to stay a little longer.
"Have a great weekend, everybody."
Tom was killed three years later.
I wasn't honest with Tom.
There are lots of animals in the park.
The public has the right to know.
Why didn't you tell us this before?
I remember telling you about it.
How did you persuade Tom to come back home?
Fill the bucket up with sand.
I hope Tom agrees to do that.
"After dinner, I did my homework."
Mary is waiting for her husband to come home.
That's exactly what Tom wants.
You made the same mistake.
Tom says he saw Mary crying.
Are you angry at Tom?
My phone rang again.
I was able to answer the question.
I won't get a chance to do that.
"It looks like the question was too easy for you. Next time, I'll have to make it a bit harder."
I don't think that I agree with you.
Tom didn't say anything to anyone.
Can you drive me to the airport tomorrow morning?
What do these symbols mean?
Tom is angry and afraid.
I don't want you to go home.
Tom said he isn't planning to do that.
He was fortunate to pass the exam.
I hope they liked me.
How would you like it?
How did Tom become the boss?
Do you want to stay for lunch?
Do you know what time they came?
I thought you were hungry.
I almost always eat lunch with Tom.
Tom came home early yesterday.
Do you have a boat?
I don't want my picture taken.
I don't care what you buy.
"To tell the truth, we got married last year."
How did you manage to do that?
We have only three days.
I think I'd better go with you.
I couldn't just sit there and do nothing.
My wife works as a nurse at a local hospital.
Maybe they'll come back.
I'm happy with the way things turned out.
Is this the reason you didn't want to come with me?
Get everything.
I'm so glad to see you.
I'd like to talk with you.
I don't know how old Tom is now.
The price of gold varies from day to day.
He's self-employed.
I got a call from Tom today.
Have you ever thought of leaving?
Can I see a picture of Tom?
I really didn't mean to hurt you.
Let's hope that we don't have to do this again.
Will you come with me to the concert?
You must stick to your promise.
I will give these tickets to whoever wants them.
He sat surrounded by young girls.
Tom can't ever keep a secret.
Tom is my next-door neighbor.
I thought that you were Tom's uncle.
Who'd ever want to leave here?
You're insane.
I'll probably see you tomorrow.
Please let me know as soon as it's decided.
I said go away.
No one was supposed to know about that.
I told you I could do it.
Tom and his family survived the earthquake.
The street was dark.
He is pleased with his new car.
I didn't know that this was the first time you kissed a girl.
It's part of my job.
Can you tell me what you're doing?
Tom always wears black.
Tom went on talking.
Tom is still working on that.
Who's the captain of this ship?
Can you teach me?
Tom sometimes talks in his sleep.
I went surfing with Tom.
Please speak to me in French.
Tom rewrote it.
I looked in the cupboard.
How long did it take you to translate this book?
You have to be strong.
I want to hear the whole story.
I don't think Tom told Mary anything.
When will you arrive?
The boy carved his name into the tree.
Here are the books you asked for.
I'm not lazy.
Tom looked at himself in the mirror.
Please tell me how to start the engine.
How long does it take to get to the station?
I thought you were a scientist.
Tom has gone bananas.
I forgot to buy Mary flowers.
"All of a sudden, Tom and I were alone."
Tom and Mary decided to go together.
"As a matter of fact, I know nothing about him."
"You aren't going to call my parents, are you?"
We've got more than enough food.
Smoking is bad for your health.
It's your turn.
The sky is clear and the sun is bright.
Have you ever seen Tom do that?
"Tom wasn't serious, was he?"
Why is everyone awake?
Am I the only one that doesn't agree with you?
Death is imminent.
Tom is a very good friend of mine.
Tom has lived in Boston for more than a year.
Washington's army has captured Trenton.
Let's dine out tonight. I'm too tired to cook.
You don't have the nerve.
What time does school begin?
Late autumn in Scotland is rather cold.
I'll ask Tom to give me some money.
He wants to be a doctor in the future.
No place is perfect.
I thought the death penalty should be abolished.
I've lost count.
We've got to get you to a hospital.
I wrote the wrong address on the envelope.
I'm not writing about you.
It seems that everybody likes golf.
Does Tom have mental problems?
You were so happy.
The movie theater was empty.
I know what may happen here.
Why don't you wear that hat anymore?
I don't know anybody in Boston.
Let's forget about what just happened.
Tom was hoping he could help Mary.
We'll be there in thirty minutes.
I'd like to go to Australia someday.
You speak so quietly that I can barely hear you.
We're trying to track Tom down.
Tom was the best.
Tom helped his mother decorate the Christmas tree.
He fished in the drawer for the key.
Do you play chess?
Tom should do the same.
I missed my flight.
I don't remember where you live.
We suddenly realized what was happening.
We're strict.
Tom is assisting a customer.
Will you ever forgive me?
I suspect that you're wrong.
What would Tom do without me?
I was very surprised when Tom told me Mary had left Boston.
It's quite likely that Tom will do that.
I learned a lot this week.
Didn't you know I used to live in Boston?
Tom didn't quit.
You know why I left.
Don't squeeze any more into the trunk.
Tom's letter really gave me a lift.
You look like a tourist.
This is your fate.
I'm scared of wild animals.
Tom doesn't know how much time it'll take him to do that.
Many languages use English words.
Who owns this villa?
We're just trying to help you.
Tom said to ask you.
Tom thinks that it's going to rain.
Tom helped Mary fix the broken table.
Tom is a romantic.
Tom gets up at six every morning.
You need new shoes.
He adapted himself to his new life.
You can sit down now.
I didn't know that you were married.
Tom said he's proud of his children.
Lock it.
I'm not an angel.
"You like French, don't you?"
Tom was obviously disappointed.
Tom said he's ready to help.
Tom is off his meds again.
What have you done for me lately?
"Tom didn't come today, either."
I think I'll buy a new car.
Where do you think Tom will live?
I've always been lucky.
Tom said he was thirsty.
Tom crushed the sheet of paper up into a ball and threw it across the room.
Keep your hands above the table.
Here's a picture of me.
I'd like to know where Tom is.
This book sells well.
We're all dying.
Is there any other size?
She means nothing to him.
Tom bought a new car.
I've talked to you about this before.
I know Tom will read it.
There are eleven rooms in this house.
The duke holds a lot of land.
I am so tired that I can't walk another step.
I won't swim.
I took this photo.
You were always a little strange.
Your bike is better than mine.
I just got up. Give me a few minutes to get ready.
I'll take it to Tom.
I don't know where I'll be next year.
It's a wonderful world.
I just don't understand you anymore.
I could tell Tom was upset.
I hate myself.
I don't like to swim in the pool.
Tom slept with his shoes on.
Please remain seated until the aircraft arrives at the gate.
Tom has to buy a book. That's why he's going to the bookstore.
That's just the point.
Why did you invite Tom to dinner?
Nobody writes to me.
Tom often quarrels with his wife.
Tom thinks Mary is still alive.
I'll be thinking of you today.
Have they announced the court's decision yet?
I'm sure Tom was awake.
Did you go to Boston?
I want to thank you for helping us win.
Why would anyone kidnap Tom?
"I know a few words of French, just enough to be understood."
"He is poor, but happy."
I don't want to go back to prison.
That would be crazy.
Where would you like to go next?
Tom is good at handball.
Can you drive me to the airport tomorrow morning?
Perhaps you've made a mistake.
Men believe what they want to.
Tom said he couldn't remember where Mary lived.
We should be in a position to help you.
I don't know if I will have time to do it.
We had no idea what to expect.
Tom loved the book Mary gave him.
I don't like his rude manner.
Have you already signed the contract?
I am tired of homework.
Tom is too young to be left alone.
All the rooms are taken.
I won't work for you.
How old is your younger son?
It can't be helped.
"You don't have very many friends, do you?"
"Oh, I'm sorry."
They've crossed the border.
I wish that I hadn't drunk so much.
Tell me something I don't know.
What kind of mushrooms are they?
I am going to let her do as she likes.
Tom was a teacher.
Do you sell fruit?
Can we get it fixed?
I don't think that Tom can be left alone.
You can hide in here until the police leave.
Did you talk to Tom about me yet?
I'll win.
Tom didn't like bananas when he was a kid.
Please shut the door.
Were you right?
That's what I mean.
One student was arrested.
I was not aware of her absence.
"However, I am not a specialist."
I want you to call the police.
How did Tom persuade Mary to help him?
All of us can speak French.
You'd better have it patented before you put it on the market.
I'm looking for my wallet. Have you seen it?
I don't think that'll happen again.
May I turn on the light?
I'll meet Tom there.
I can't help feeling something's not quite right.
The train is made up of fifteen cars.
Is there any help available?
"Well, what happened to her?"
Do you love each other very much?
Tom reacted appropriately.
I don't think that I can love two people at the same time.
Tom is swimming with his kids in the pool.
I haven't been in Boston since October.
Put some clothes on.
I know I owe you money.
I never was shy.
Didn't you hear me call?
I thought you said Tom needed more time.
I don't think Tom needs a bodyguard.
The speaker aroused the anger of the audience.
Mt. Everest is the highest peak in the world.
I thought Tom was in prison.
I have a proposition for you.
"You didn't go by yourself, did you?"
Tom and John pretended they were brothers.
You still have a lot to learn.
Just tell me what happened next.
I don't like to eat fish with many bones.
How old were you when you got married?
It's cold in Boston in the winter.
I was tired with the work.
They're spies.
Why didn't Tom try to help Mary?
We aren't disappointed.
"You know Tom, don't you?"
Tell Tom where to put the suitcases.
Tom needs a shoulder to cry on.
It's not yours.
It will soon be September.
I know that you won't like it in Boston.
I still have to finish painting the fence.
It isn't interesting.
Tom took a step toward Mary.
Do people in Australia eat a lot of meat?
Enter the laboratory and press the emergency button.
Tom looked out the window.
I'm pretty old.
Tom worked all his life.
Tom got bored and left.
Tom is never going to see Mary again.
Put your coat on a hanger.
That's an interesting-looking salt shaker.
I took a sleeping pill last night.
I know that you know where Tom is.
Are these my socks or your socks?
It's dinnertime.
I'm too old to dance.
Tom has a tendency to jump to conclusions.
"Take us there, Tom."
Tom fell asleep with his glasses on.
My grandmother can't see very well.
I didn't scream.
More than 75% of farms raised pigs and milk cows.
Our budget is very limited.
Don't let them see you're afraid.
Are you sleepy?
I've already had coffee.
Tom and I both screamed.
What time do you leave work?
"You can swim, can't you?"
I've decided to go.
Tom asked Mary to wait.
All Tom needed was a little more time.
How old is your refrigerator?
I say what I think.
Last night I was at home.
Tom called Mary.
I'm not thin.
Tom is well paid.
Wind is a cheap and clean source of energy.
I didn't know that Tom had died.
I know what you're doing.
Tom got undressed.
The curtains are closed.
I'm as tall as you.
What he says has nothing to do with this problem.
I have family in Boston.
I'm not as bad as Tom.
Thanks to both of you.
How many people do you know in Boston?
The combination of these factors has led to an interesting result.
I'm still waiting for you to answer to my question.
Try to calm down.
We want to talk to you about that.
I'm celebrating.
The glass broke to pieces.
I think you're the one who's mistaken.
This one is special.
Do you like peanut butter?
Why did you start doing that?
Do you think Tom is still asleep?
Tom gets a very good salary.
I'll stay with the baby if you want to go.
We've only got three more days.
She gave her father a tie.
I'm still not used to it yet.
There's something wrong.
I can't stand this pain any more.
I think I've already given you enough money.
I held my breath and waited.
Tom thinks I'm crazy.
Can you read what's written on the blackboard?
I know what you do.
He turned off the light.
Tom introduced Mary to John.
I promise I won't tell anyone that Tom is here.
I was sick.
Is anyone looking?
That's Tom's decision.
He is the heaviest of us all.
Did you buy a return ticket?
This explains everything.
Where is Paris?
Will you buy it?
What'll you do then?
You're wrong. That's not what I said.
Life is beautiful.
Tom wants to play golf with Mary.
I don't want to hurt anyone.
I'm going to show you something.
People laughed at Tom.
There's nobody here.
The cat is sleeping on the chair.
Tom is a schemer.
Let me explain it to you.
Why are you pretending you don't know me?
Mary rarely gives her husband presents.
You always get all the attention.
I'm glad I helped you do that.
Could you teach me how to play chess?
I didn't want to look stupid.
My daughter's your age.
"You don't believe Tom did that on purpose, do you?"
Try to get the story straight.
Are you fluent in French?
Tom has helped me so much.
I think you underestimate Tom.
Everyone except me knew it.
Tom had a heart attack last year.
Tom recommended Mary.
Tom wrote down Mary's telephone number.
That wouldn't help me.
We are happy to see you again.
I helped my father water the flowers.
Tom confessed to stealing the money.
I hate my neighbors.
How much money does Tom spend a month?
Were there any customers?
I'm allergic to peanuts.
I think I need some help.
Time is on their side.
I can smell it from here.
When did you tell Tom about that?
How close were you?
Where's my lucky blue cap?
Don't say anything.
You make me want to cry.
I didn't go.
Give me the next one.
I wish I had married your sister instead of you.
I think that Tom is still scared.
What do chimpanzees eat?
Tom said that Mary was busy.
We need to fix this problem now.
I want him to solve the problem.
I didn't even get one letter from her.
They are very big.
I want you to read this letter.
I always knew it would happen eventually.
A lot of people think Buenos Aires is located in Brazil.
He has already told the police what happened.
Let's try once again.
This is your last opportunity.
He became more mature with the passing of the years.
Where is your badge?
I couldn't find it.
Tom is telling his children a bedtime story.
Tom got off the bus and headed home.
I thought that you loved Tom.
I went to bed after locking all the doors and windows.
"Where were you? ""I was at a friend's house."""
This benefits no one.
"I want children, but my husband doesn't."
"You're not married, are you?"
Straighten your tie.
I didn't stay long.
The last time I saw Tom he was as drunk as a skunk.
I saw her a week ago today.
We need to be really careful.
I don't have any more water.
Your shoes are here.
I can't believe that you're really in love with me.
I'm shorter than Tom is.
Life and death are two sides of the same coin.
I grabbed my little sister's hand and started running.
Tom isn't going to let that happen.
Tom was supposed to hand in his homework before the weekend.
Never have I seen such a beautiful rainbow.
I didn't know you were hungry.
He had breakfast all alone.
I've already told Tom to be there tomorrow by 2:30.
I'm not going out because I have to do my homework.
Tom used the floor jack.
I knew it was going to happen.
They aren't stupid.
Tom has promised to do that.
Keep in touch with me.
I've never told anyone that before.
Tom answered all our questions.
Tom values your friendship.
Tom doesn't want our help.
He wants me to help him.
You have a big problem.
I didn't know what Tom wanted me to say.
Everyone likes you.
You still need help.
How much longer will you be here?
I'll try not to disturb you while you're studying.
Skip it.
I'll come by bus.
Tom disappeared.
I didn't expect that to come from you.
Tom asked me if I had a sister.
Please don't be late.
I thought you brought your guitar.
I'm last.
It's raining again.
I know that Tom is rich.
The dog is chewing on something.
How long will it take to get there?
Don't forget your money.
Tom was looking at me.
I've already told Tom I'm not going to do that.
Tom said he wished he were rich.
Does Tom still live on Park Street?
The FBI tapped Tom's phone.
"Everyone came to the party, except Tom."
I told everyone to be careful.
What are you going to be in the future?
I could kill you.
I'd be happy to do that for you.
The hunter shot at a deer.
When did you make this decision?
I think there's something wrong.
Tom admitted that he was nervous.
I must leave you.
She stabbed him.
They don't pay you enough.
Be careful with him. He's a Don Juan.
This is all the money that I have now.
You're very strong.
We're going to get married.
I couldn't help Tom.
Tom bought a ticket to Boston.
Do you want to go anywhere else?
I was expecting you.
Don't air your dirty laundry in public.
I don't want to see your face again.
Tom didn't want Mary to get into trouble.
You may go there.
I thought you'd left.
Do you see a resemblance?
I'm sorry I was late this morning.
I want to lie down for a few minutes.
He tried to stand up.
I pretended it didn't happen.
The nation ceased to exist.
Tom will be returning soon.
I'll visit you tomorrow.
Not everybody can be an artist.
Tom refused to lend me any money.
I'm no friend of yours.
Tom has curly dark hair.
Tom hasn't met Mary.
The squeaking of the door gets on my nerves.
That's a waste of time and money.
It's 99.9% effective.
Tom can play a flute.
I'm not hungry yet.
Why should Tom apologize to you?
You have a visitor.
Tom wasn't able to solve the problem.
Do you want an orange?
The Giants got clobbered yesterday.
I now finally understand what Tom was trying to tell me.
May I direct your attention to this?
Tom and Mary got divorced three years ago.
"If I have enough time tomorrow, I'll go shopping."
It's in good hands.
I was held up last night.
You're a cruel man.
I know your secret.
I was here yesterday.
I'm lucky to be here.
Tom never goes anywhere without his dog.
I thought I'd give you a key.
It wasn't hard.
I think that that was a good decision.
What happened on October twentieth?
You must sell it.
"She knew a lot of songs, too."
You know who we are.
Tom respects Mary a lot.
I don't think Tom knows how long that's going to take.
I hope that Tom has finally found what he was looking for.
There isn't a single country left on the gold standard.
They've been doing that for years.
I don't know if that's true.
How many brothers does Tom have?
"The car is old, but it is good."
Stop talking and get back to work.
The man you saw in my office yesterday is from Belgium.
I think we found the problem.
The boy remained silent.
Tom has already drunk three cups of coffee.
He took advantage of the fine weather to paint the wall.
I hardly ever laugh.
I wonder if this rumor is true.
Did you know that Tom can't speak French?
That bicycle isn't his.
I wish it hadn't happened the way it did.
I know all about you.
Mary placed her purse on the table.
Tom didn't need to tell Mary what to do.
You knew Tom better than I did.
Let's schedule it for some other time.
Tom is a wonderful kid.
He works as hard as any student.
I had a hard time finding Tom.
I've forgotten your last name.
Tom is saving his money up to start a business.
"I don't think so, either."
I know Tom misses you.
We'll have to wait three hours.
It's a dead tree.
Tom advised me not to buy a used car.
Is it far from here?
We all played well.
I thought it would be better to remain silent.
"Don't worry, I won't turn you in to the police."
That TV is huge.
I came back home.
Monday will probably be a rainy day.
Your effort deserves praise.
Tom has a lot of time.
You're very arrogant.
Protect me.
Who saw you?
You didn't need to do that.
You deserve the best.
The game is about to begin.
Did Tom go to Boston?
It's been two years since I came here.
Nobody will dance with me.
Do you remember the title of that book?
We sat on the bench in the park.
We'll be there in three hours.
You're a liar.
"If found guilty, Tom faces a life sentence."
When will this be acted upon?
The plane takes off at 8:00 a.m.
The cup is filled to the brim.
Mary could be a model.
All the ingredients are fresh.
Finish eating.
I know these guys.
Are you sure it was Tom who did this?
Keep your eyes on the road.
Those shoes gave me blisters.
Why did you listen to them?
I opened the box.
Tom was hot.
"Thanks to his efforts, all the crew were saved."
Tom's grandmother passed away last night.
Tom says he's having trouble with his computer.
Tom will be denied membership.
Tom eats alone in front of his computer.
My father would never allow me to go out with someone like you.
Where's your shirt?
Can we count on Tom's help?
Tom has nice skin.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Tom caught the ball with both hands.
It is no use trying to persuade him.
Did you record it?
The old man planted a tree.
I think we'll be able to come to an understanding soon.
I need to know who Tom is.
I hope you're not trying to fool us.
"What more do you want, Tom?"
I can't decide whether to go or not.
She ditched me.
I like to sing.
Where can I rent a car?
"Turn off the TV before you go to bed, OK?"
I'm sure that's not what Tom meant.
The machine was coated with dust.
"You'll tell me later, right?"
The worst is still to come.
I get off at the next station.
I suspect that you won't like it.
Wait in the waiting room.
I had finished my homework when you called me.
Tom couldn't shake the feeling that there was something wrong.
Do you think I want to do this?
Tom waited for someone to come.
"Although he was wrong, he didn't say he was sorry."
Do you think Tom is bored?
Tom is just that kind of person.
Tom often drinks alone.
"I thought if I left Boston, I could forget you."
Tom went back to bed as if nothing had happened.
Why don't you let me decide?
The plane made a forced landing.
It's been wonderful.
I want to remodel my kitchen.
I told Tom to do that.
Don't spend too much money.
I want to emigrate to Australia.
Don't you understand how important this is?
I fixed it.
I'm tired of being sick.
I could tell that Tom had been crying.
Does your father work?
I never trusted you.
Are you still living with your parents?
I wish I hadn't told Tom about what happened.
He's just an ordinary student.
"I don't see why I can't go, too."
I've already told everyone I'm moving to Australia.
Please forgive me for opening your letter by mistake.
"What day is today? ""It's Monday."""
I thought you were serious.
Can I borrow this for a little while?
Are you the one in charge?
Isn't that a coincidence?
Would you please boil an egg for me?
Let's have breakfast.
I don't think Tom was lying.
I haven't done anything wrong.
He was sent to prison for armed robbery.
Tom has a wine cellar in his basement.
The resemblance between these two men is uncanny.
Happy anniversary!
Tom got the job.
I hope Tom never finds out what happened here today.
Did you drink a lot?
I'm afraid.
I had heart surgery.
"Try to understand it in Spanish, without translating to English."
I bought Tom a toy car.
I thought you said you weren't coming today.
We're still doing that.
Follow me.
We're going to the beach. Would you like to go with us?
Tom hasn't yet been found.
I hope to hear from you.
Do you know the guy next door?
Your birthday is coming.
Tom felt humiliated.
All of my friends like soccer.
"Tom, can I say something?"
Let's not worry about that now.
This is very good.
Tom looks cool no matter what he wears.
I hoped everyone would laugh.
Is Tom your friend?
I should've asked you before.
Why am I still here?
Explain yourself.
"She is not only pretty, but also kind."
Tom already regrets doing that.
I couldn't have done it without you. Thank you.
Tom won't be successful.
I can't speak either French or English.
We were wrong.
I don't think I deserved that.
Please don't forget to shut the door.
Leave this sheet blank.
Have I ever told about how I met your mother?
I can explain it.
I know that you'll be able to do that.
I read your report.
"If you were in my place, what would you do?"
Do you need something else?
Tom told me to leave right away.
The accident occurred at dawn.
Tom did that by himself.
We did the same thing.
I want to be a teacher when I grow up.
I hope that Tom can win.
I didn't want to leave without saying goodbye.
I'd advise you to let Tom go.
She slammed the door.
Everyone sympathized with Tom.
What do I owe?
Tom is fun to be around.
They can't be right.
Tom smiled at them all.
Tom said he didn't think Mary had a driver's license.
He suddenly rose from the chair.
You're almost as tall as Tom.
I've already tried it.
His house was sold for ten thousand dollars.
Tom wasn't rich.
It's 2:00 p.m.
Who's on duty today?
I can't tell if you're joking or not.
"If it's raining, I won't go."
Why would I fire you?
Can I get you some water?
I watched a movie.
We try to go to Boston at least once a year.
Why are you sleeping?
How could I know?
We did great.
I thought you knew something that I didn't know.
She went to that store.
I don't have any other options.
I agree to a certain extent.
How many flowers are there in the vase?
He's a sophomore.
I'm not satisfied with the restaurant's service.
You can't even help yourself.
You did say that.
Tom called the police.
Tom loves ice cream.
Tom was wearing jeans and a T-shirt.
Tom kept on walking.
Tom went backstage after the show.
We know who you are.
Tom is arguing with someone.
There has been no rain here for the past two weeks.
You need to decide.
I won't laugh.
Do you have to do this very often?
I can live with this.
That was only a figure of speech.
You've let me down.
Everyone has something to lose.
My grandfather on my mother's side is celebrating his 60th birthday tomorrow.
I got carded.
Please tell me how to do this.
"He shot at the bird, but missed it."
I'm not worried about Tom.
Tom is always eating.
Tom only made a few mistakes.
All the students went home.
I hope they appreciate your humor.
Why do you ask me that?
Just don't disappear.
He's lived here his entire life.
I can tell it's him by the way he speaks.
What caused the power failure?
Can I use the phone?
I know that Tom is bored.
Tom was just happy to talk to someone.
Tom didn't look like a freak.
I've made a lot of enemies.
They abandoned you.
I know you have a lot of questions.
"Tom wanted to kill Mary, but John stopped him."
I need you to leave.
Could we have a table near the window?
Wait until I get back.
"You understand this, don't you?"
The bank wants its money back.
Let's go to Tom's house.
I didn't take it.
It can be cold here even in May.
I've decided that I'm going to shave my head.
Tom looked through the window and saw Mary.
Tom doesn't have a French-English dictionary.
You haven't paid me yet.
It happens every night.
I've been dreaming of this trip for a long time.
She wants to meet him again.
I think you know what I'm talking about.
The apples are not quite ripe.
The two brothers are like two peas in a pod.
Tom seems to be eating all the time.
"If you ask me, Tom is the problem."
I think Tom is still alive.
Don't open the windows.
The phone kept ringing.
Tom is a really good goalie.
I warned you that Tom was coming.
I'm not much of a swimmer.
We have to know what's causing this.
Who's going to hurt you?
We're putting our furniture in storage for the summer.
Tom was Mary's only child.
They killed a goat as a sacrifice to God.
I have a few things I have to do before I can go home tonight.
Why isn't Tom going to Boston?
I won't help Tom anymore.
Who told you to wait here?
The audience burst out laughing.
Tom's muscles were tired and he wanted to get home and soak in a hot bath for a while.
Tom pointed out our mistakes.
Tom told Mary to leave.
I need to go in.
You can go back.
One student was arrested.
She has three brothers.
"OK, let's do this."
Get out of my kitchen.
Tom isn't going to be angry if Mary does that.
She passed the exam.
Tom told me you were afraid.
Why is Tom so happy?
Tom pushed open the door and entered the room.
We won't be doing that anymore.
Tom was watching TV last night.
Is it too salty?
Tom isn't likely to be able to do that.
I thought you wouldn't like Boston.
Tom became suspicious.
Tom won't be able to win today.
I want to hear your version of what happened.
I'll do the same.
A trickle of blood ran down his neck.
I want to wear jeans.
"You know them, don't you?"
I was 13 at the time.
Tom is dealing drugs.
Tom isn't the enemy.
This is a wonderful book.
I think we'll make it if we hurry.
When did you become a Boy Scout?
I slept until noon.
I'm sure you are wrong.
Tom and Mary finally decided to get married.
The death penalty has been done away with in many states in the USA.
You've got to get rid of it.
I didn't study either of the languages.
Read as much as possible.
Ask him when the next plane will be.
I don't have any water.
Did you follow them?
Does anybody want to take a walk to the beach?
You don't even know Tom.
Tom put out the fire.
Why don't we play chess or something?
I shouldn't have said that.
I recently left my job.
I got my left arm bruised.
Tom goes to the supermarket almost every day.
We have five classes every day except Saturday.
I think that's what Tom did.
The assistant took the money.
Italy is far from Brazil.
I don't have to talk to you.
This apple tastes sour.
Tom won't likely win.
Can Tom get a dog?
We waited till 2:30.
I don't believe he is a lawyer.
Tom stayed home from work because he was sick.
Tom died in Autralia in 2013.
I'm going to fix this.
Here's the money I owe you.
They've lied to me.
Tom did not cry.
Please stop.
She was brave.
The traffic was terrible.
I'm kind of tired today.
I've been very pleased with Tom's work.
You're the owner.
You aren't needed.
I'd hate to disappoint Tom.
I'm retired.
Tom is home.
Don't you think it's still a little too early to talk to Tom about this?
Tom is fluent in three languages.
The girl was afraid to jump down from the roof.
Do you know where you want to go?
Open your window.
I brought you some hot soup.
Can you tell me how you found out what Tom did?
I really don't know what to do.
I saw you on TV.
May I help you?
I need everybody's help.
Are you telling me that Tom doesn't know?
You can stop now.
Were you at Tom's party?
I thought that you'd be interested.
Tom entered without knocking.
Tom doesn't normally do that.
You need to take your shoes off before entering the room.
No one knows we're here.
Tom is watering the garden.
I feel comfortable.
His parents came from Germany.
I have to speak with you.
She managed to escape.
He often dropped in on me.
The room was lit by candles.
Let's split the bill.
Tom told me to answer all your questions.
It's only a theory.
It's okay to go.
Help finally arrived.
Does it hurt to get your ears pierced?
I'm very patient.
Tom's dog didn't bark at me.
Are those your daughters?
I heard a strange noise coming from the kitchen.
They'll be here tonight.
I can't go anywhere.
I am glad to meet you.
We've always had a good relationship.
Can anyone tell me the time?
I think you should do it.
Tom is a diabetic.
I went there for the purpose of meeting him.
One man was killed.
That's too expensive for me to buy.
I knew you'd come home.
There were many things that I didn't like about that movie.
I can't eat that much food by myself.
Tom can't read yet.
No one knew Tom couldn't speak French.
I often go abroad.
Didn't you know Tom was good at playing chess?
When did you return?
Tom told me not to tell you anything.
How has the Internet changed your job?
Let me remind you of something.
It's pretty routine.
Tom's lack of compassion surprised Mary.
Are you a superstitious person?
I received your letter yesterday.
Do you hear something?
I thought you hated me.
You said that you were hungry.
We didn't see any children at all.
I remember seeing her once.
I didn't go to Australia last month.
Life is short.
I want to find out if Tom is going to go out and eat with us.
I think Tom is kind.
The flutes and violins are playing in unison.
Tom sings off key.
The patient seemed to be healthy.
You know everyone.
Let's stay together.
I hope Tom comes tomorrow.
You said I was beautiful.
Tom needs rest.
I was never good at grammar.
I told Tom about Mary.
I thought you were unemployed.
I intended to have called on you yesterday.
I figured I could be of some help.
I'm the one who did it.
The man was too fat to move by himself.
Can you really do it?
They don't know how much I love Tom.
I can barely control myself.
Tom is upset.
How did you persuade Tom to sing?
Tom didn't seem to get it.
We're not expecting your help.
Tom told me that I was mistaken.
Tom and I were both drunk.
A little rest would do us a lot of good.
Wow! You've lost a lot of weight.
Tom was born in Boston in 2013.
Don't you want to invite Tom to your birthday party?
I bought myself a very expensive sports car.
One must keep one's promises.
Tom kicked the ball really hard.
Don't you get it?
I know we can do that for you.
Tom knows Mary will win.
I don't know who this belongs to.
Tom said Mary seldom does that.
I plan to have lunch with Tom.
Tom rarely makes a mistake.
Are you going to help us?
You may use mine if you want to.
You can stay with us.
Do you walk to school every day?
Please come to the point.
I think you know that we have to help Tom do that.
You have to stop drinking.
Can you describe it?
I just guessed.
I wonder what raccoons eat.
Would you like to go fishing with me this weekend?
Please fill out this form.
That's a doll.
We are not expecting any help from you.
His condition got worse every day.
Let us help you.
Tom has been abroad for three years.
The leaves on the tree have turned red.
They all loved Tom.
The population of Tokyo is greater than that of London.
Tom got up earlier than usual.
Didn't you know Tom lived in Australia when he was a child?
Tom abandoned me.
I nearly starved.
Everything Tom said was true.
It's very nice of you.
There was a lot of food in the house.
"Tom, will you stop that?"
Nobody talks about you.
Maybe it was you.
She translated it word for word.
Tom seems calm.
Tom bent down and picked up a handful of sand.
How many sandwiches are there left?
I was actually born in Boston.
They fought for freedom.
Where are we going anyway?
He lives a long way away.
Tom's unconscious.
This is the best book that I've ever read.
Everybody was singing except me.
Prices rose higher and higher.
Don't walk so fast.
Who is the father?
She has known better days.
I don't think Tom bought anything.
I know you'll enjoy this movie.
I'd like to learn how to arrange flowers.
I don't think Tom knows where Mary has gone.
We'll find you.
I can wait.
I like this town.
Ask Tom where he is.
Tom ate three apples.
I can't call Tom.
I had to study French in high school.
You've got to see Tom.
Tom believes anything is possible.
Tom was throwing rocks at my dog.
How long have you lived here?
Are you hungry at all?
I live in Europe.
Tom pulled out a notebook and pen.
Tell Tom.
I have family in Boston.
Nothing ever happens here.
The view is amazing.
Keep in touch.
I've never driven a sports car before.
I don't remember mailing the letter.
I bought a house with a swimming pool.
I regretted doing that.
Tom and Mary dated for three months.
Tom said I need to do that.
He made a gesture with his hand.
I was talking about you.
"Tom doesn't eat meat, does he?"
Tom wanted me to tell you something.
Please stop the war.
Tom said he was hoping you would do that.
I got home at 2:30.
So what do you want to know?
Tom now lives with his mom.
Tom's girlfriend threatened to leave him.
Tom is a lot younger than I am.

There were a lot of people in the room.
I think that I'm going to be fired.
It's so loud.
Tom is allergic to fish.
I called them.
Tom wasn't the one who hit me.
Tom is busy again.
They didn't leave anything for me.
Try to open the door.
"Bring me a sheet of paper, please."
Please don't tell Tom.
I knew Tom wouldn't wait.
Please tell me the correct time.
I'd like to ask you a couple questions.
Who told you that would happen?
Tom didn't notice anything suspicious.
I don't need it anymore.
I took him to the hospital.
Tell me something about Tom.
There should be no secrets between us.
Tom told me to leave right away.
Let's eat lunch outside.
I want to know who helped you do your homework.
I'm glad you decided to come.
"Help us, please."
Tom said he didn't plan to go this week.
How much did this cost?
He kept reading a book.
I'm Tom's dad.
Tom was confused.
I only work three hours a day.
Why am I so sleepy?
Has Tom eaten anything?
I would never break a promise.
Mary had flowers in her hair.
I've already told you everything I know about that.
She washed her dirty hands before the meal.
Is that peanut butter?
Tom loves architecture.
Try not to worry too much.
He acquired Russian quickly.
What's in this box?
Why didn't you help Tom today?
I'm free this evening.
I am like him.
Don't argue with a woman when she's tired.
We were caught in a traffic jam on the way.
Why didn't you call the police?
Everybody was clapping.
You're smarter than me.
I am writing to express my dissatisfaction.
Tom has the respect of everyone here.
Don't let this chance slip by.
I wish I hadn't gone to Boston with Tom.
Did you help Tom wash windows?
Don't forget to sign the contract.
You shouldn't go out after dark.
What do you like about it?
"She visits him quite often, but never stays very long."
Do you know Tom's full name?
"All things considered, I think we could say that the meeting was successful and met its objectives."
This doesn't burn.
Tom divorced Mary last year.
"Hearing him speak English, one would take him for an Englishman."
Let's consider the worst that could happen.
I'm going to leave a message.
Why has the train stopped?
How would you react if your wife told you that?
I've retired.
I'll never give up.
I hope you're insured.
This one's free.
I'd agree with that.
I'm surprised that you're so naive.
Please do not write in this library book.
Do you subscribe to any magazines?
I'm getting married on October 20th.
Show me where Boston is on the map.
It's stupid.
I'll take that one.
Where was Tom yesterday?
They didn't understand your joke.
How can I forget it?
She had a strange hat on.
The clock is ticking.
Swimming in this river is dangerous.
Tom did that in order to survive.
Tom sent me that.
I think I remember you.
I didn't want to die.
Tom found an empty pill bottle under the bed.
Do you wear a kimono?
Why did you skip school?
When was this car washed?
I thought that you wanted to watch that movie.
I'll kill you.
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
Tom got kicked by a horse.
How far was it?
You are welcome to the use of my yacht.
How can I stop being afraid?
Tom came to visit us yesterday.
How many years ago did you do that?
I don't want to play with you.
Did you do this all yourself?
There's a fountain in the center of the park.
The show's about to start.
She listens to religious music.
Who do you want to go to Australia with?
Tom ran away from home.
Tom turned and looked at me.
The garage was empty.
Do you think I look happy?
I want you to try it.
Hurry! Tom says it's urgent.
At least somebody is having a good time.
What Tom said was beside the point.
No one knew what to do.
Tom looked at his hands.
This program has both downloading and uploading capabilities.
Is it OK if I change the channel?
"It's a good idea, Tom."
"If Tom hadn't invited me, I wouldn't have come."
We have to find Tom before the police do.
Tom and Mary's wedding anniversary is October 20th.
Tom treats Mary well.
They often drop in at my house.
Tom can't win.
It's not reasonable.
That would take hours.
"You're not going to the party dressed like that, are you?"
Tom didn't want to be a snitch.
They're a couple.
Are you referring to me?
You should choose your friends very carefully.
Do you think it's just a coincidence?
Tom bought Mary a new car.
I hope to be back by Monday.
Tom didn't invite me to his birthday party.
I can't stay here anymore.
I think Tom did that on purpose.
Are you still mad?
How did you escape?
"If you need any help, call me."
I like horses.
You should've listened to Tom.
Put it down.
Why didn't you hire Tom?
I go there three times a year.
I think this is very rare.
There's room for one more in my car.
He won't leave us alone.
I came with my friends.
Dry your hands on this towel.
We're fine.
These two have very little in common.
It's an expression.
Your answer to the question is not correct.
Did Tom go alone?
I can't get her out of my mind.
I wonder what impressed Tom.
Tom was drinking vodka.
He cut himself free with his knife.
Their rooms are always clean.
Tom doesn't think Mary is worried.
Tom was advised not to do that.
Are you really going to eat that?
They will keep their promise.
I get the impression that Tom is in love with you.
Tom didn't talk about you.
You should've done that in October.
All you do is ask questions.
Go and get me some wine.
We're not hiring anymore.
Would you like to talk to a lawyer?
The worst was yet to come.
Tom wouldn't abandon Mary.
It was only a nightmare.
You must be careful.
I noticed that this morning.
I think that Tom will be furious.
I want you to do this right.
I have to go back to my office.
I think it's the best way.
He hit me back.
How's your father?
Just don't break anything.
How many do you need?
We crossed the lake in a boat.
I'm looking for a gift for a friend of mine.
Tom has to do it now.
Do you need money?
It's too heavy.
I've seen them all.
Plastic bags are bad for the environment.
I don't deny this.
What's in front of you?
That's old news.
I don't think my life is boring.
Does that mean you bought it?
They were very polite.
I know you were proud of me.
Tom called the insurance company to report that his car had been stolen.
Do I have to decide right now?
Tom told Mary to go home.
Where do I sign?
Don't do that here.
You need to call Tom.
That is a good idea.
Tom and Mary raised three children.
Are there any English magazines in this library?
What makes you think Tom will be late?
Look at that cat.
I'm the youngest.
How did your date go?
I ran a red light.
Don't you think this is ridiculous?
Do you really want me to drink that?
Who are you trying to convince?
Tom knows we believe Mary.
I wasn't looking at you.
I won't stay here for long.
There are very few passengers in the train.
Tell me what I have to do next.
It's likely to be hot tomorrow.
Tom came forward.
They don't care about that.
I don't want Tom getting upset.
Recently the demand for this product has increased faster than the supply.
Tom will explain this to you later.
Why is he in the church?
How about another round?
Tom is sure Mary will do that.
She's waiting for you at home.
That's exactly what I want.
Don't be ashamed of yourself.
I'm not supposed to tell anyone about it.
The key is on the table.
You may sit anywhere you like.
He made the children laugh.
We didn't expect it.
You can't kill both of us.
It came to nothing.
Is it your fault or ours?
Are you still asking yourself what the meaning of life is?
I told you I didn't know.
Why would anybody kidnap Tom?
You mind if I join you?
Tom bought a cake for dessert.
Tom was brought up by Mary.
I don't think it was Tom's fault.
We haven't talked to Tom yet.
"If you want to go, go."
My sister works as a secretary in a big multinational.
I bathe every day.
How long will Tom be in prison?
You're ruining everything.
Why not wait until tomorrow?
It's cold. Could you close the window?
Did you tell Tom about Mary?
Do as you're told.
We'd better throw it away.
I don't think that Tom and Mary will ever get married.
Do you want to see Tom?
When are you going to be back?
"I'm sorry, but your names aren't on the list."
Mary took the cookies out of the oven.
I'll make you breakfast.
Graham Greene is one of my favorite authors.
I forgot to bring my bathing suit.
Tom and Mary often played tennis together after school.
Tom wants to know who won.
This house is far too small.
Did you just come up with this?
I think you're capable of anything.
I can't play chess yet.
I wonder who invented it.
The Eiffel Tower is in Paris.
Tom promised me he would come early.
Give me a couple more hours.
We suspect poisoning.
I can't tell you why.
I lost my purse.
Whose is it?
You'll catch pneumonia.
Tom is making us do this.
The audience clapped politely.
It's not an error.
Tom wouldn't allow Mary to go.
Don't ever make me wait again.
This room is very hot.
Call if you need me.
I'm afraid we can't help you.
I guess it's true.
Tom didn't tell us that.
I think Tom will be there.
How long did it take for you to read this book?
What month is your birthday?
Music makes our life happy.
The milk is in the fridge.
It was a huge project.
Tom's disappearance completely baffled the police.
"Well, let's have a look."
The house was empty.
Where was the knife found?
I knew you'd have enough time.
I can't believe Tom ate the whole thing.
"The sooner, the better."
"So, are you seeing anyone?"
She is out of danger.
Do I look fat in this?
We all had fun.
Have you seen my car keys?
Tom poured some apple juice into a glass.
Those books look as if they're going to topple over any minute.
How did the traffic accident happen?
Do you want to say something?
You've got to get out of there.
I talked to him after class.
I knew that that was going to happen.
I collect postcards.
I was having trouble concentrating.
I am familiar with the way he asks questions.
Whose handbag is this?
I can wait for you.
Can you buy one for me as well?
I got married on October 20th.
"Well, it's complicated."
What a tragic story!
He missed the last train.
I do forgive Tom.
I told Tom I had plans.
She mended her socks.
"Tom did the best he could, but he still wasn't able to pass the course."
You have no idea how important you are to me.
Tom and I aren't related.
This telephone is out of order.
Be serious.
Do you understand Roman numerals?
Tom thinks that Mary can do that.
Tom didn't want to go to war.
Where are the rest of the files?
It was bad.
It's very rare for that to happen.
I didn't know that Tom had already bought milk.
Did you see that flash of lightning?
Have you begun yet?
Do you know if Tom is seeing anyone?
She's mine.
"What he lacked in wit, he made up for in energy."
I told Tom the reason why I wouldn't be able to go.
"I remember it as if it were yesterday, but in reality it was fifteen years ago."
Tom owes Mary an apology.
But I wasn't afraid.
Give me a good one.
Tom goes fishing every weekend.
There's no salt in the salt shaker.
I bought a slow cooker.
This is an old building.
Do you want to go to a museum with me?
We became good friends.
This is a hospital.
I wasn't complaining.
I recommended Tom.
Tom drove back to Boston.
I don't want them to suffer.
It's locked.
Tell me which one to choose.
You're too young to travel by yourself.
I liked Tom.
Parents are responsible for their children's education.
The heat is overwhelming.
She is engaged to a rich man.
Why don't you do something about the situation?
"If you had been more tactful, you might have sold Tom the idea."
Would you please speak a little quieter?
Tom said it was a joke.
Tom warned Mary not to lend money to John.
Do you know who the traitor is?
Give me your gun.
I'd like to talk to you in my office.
There's someone waiting for you in the lobby.
Were you able to convince Tom?
She also writes about loss and trauma.
I thought you'd be grateful.
When can I call you?
This is the right answer.
I heard you talking.
Tom said he didn't like this.
Just put it here.
I can't imagine my life without Mary.
May I ask you what your weight is?
Where did you find it?
It looks as though we shall have to go without a holiday this year.
I won't allow you to ruin your life.
I was at a conference last week.
Try to answer as many questions as possible.
The road is very slippery.
I think that Tom left.
Nobody had an answer.
I've talked with Tom about that already.
Something was stirring in the dark.
This is the coldest winter that we have had in thirty years.
I don't know Tom.
I don't want Tom to go anywhere without me.
I thought you went to your room to sleep.
Tom managed to pass the examination.
The concert is about to begin.
"Tom is my friend, too."
Is that your girlfriend?
They were drunk.
Keep your hands up.
I think Tom has misunderstood me.
I teased Tom.
Tom is almost never wrong.
A letter was found next to the dead body.
The long war came to an end at last.
Why aren't you ready?
I want to eat something that isn't sweet.
We want to help Tom.
Please don't tell Tom about what we did.
I shouldn't have believed you.
Is there something I can do to help you?
You spelled my name wrong.
That's a direct order.
I think we all know that.
We'll find a way to use it.
Give me a day or two.
You've been told not to do that.
Let me give you my phone number.
She doesn't speak Japanese at home.
Her legs are long.
I very much want to speak with you.
I know very little about Tom.
Tell Tom why you were fired.
You've been living in Boston too long.
I thought you'd gone.
I was just about to go to bed.
Tom doesn't have the willpower to do that.
I knew Tom would leave eventually.
He is eager to go to China.
What're you doing here?
This drives me nuts.
Tom was crazy about you.
Did you see the game yesterday?
That's not enough.
I don't envy you.
Are you sure those students are Canadians?
They took a trip to the capital.
I thought Tom wouldn't come.
I don't speak French as fluently as you.
You said that it was urgent.
Tom wasn't persuaded by Mary's explanation.
"You were hungry, weren't you?"
How long do you want to stay in Boston?
I think we're related.
Ask him whether she is at home or not.
I got up early to catch the first train.
How many times have I told you not to help Tom?
"From the hill, we could see all the buildings in the city."
I think he is a good driver.
Tom was scared to ask questions because he didn't want to look stupid.
It all started on a hot summer night.
We need guys like you.
Tom's response was immediate.
Tom needs our support.
My brother was the apple of my father's eye.
I knew Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
I have no respect for Tom.
I don't know them.
There's no need to ask for permission.
Tom refused to speak to me.
We saved a lot of time by going down Park Street.
It's unlikely that replacing the battery will fix the problem.
I wrote to him for quite another reason.
I don't drink coffee at all.
It's in my backpack.
You look the way your father did thirty years ago.
The train hasn't arrived yet.
Are you heading somewhere?
Nobody went with me.
I saw you crying.
Look at that boy running.
I made this chair.
I love bird watching.
I want to see them!
What's wrong with the water?
Tom smiled amiably.
What do you usually do on Friday night?
I like challenges.
This time is going to be different.
I'm useless.
I may sit in the back.
We buy toilet paper made from recycled paper.
Watch carefully and you can see how my lips move in pronouncing the word.
My father was already at home when I came back.
Look what you did.
Have you already finished?
Tom got up from the table.
I'm afraid I have other plans.
That's an unquestionable fact.
I need you to open the door for me.
Do you know how to do first aid?
I refuse to go.
We got here on time.
What do your brothers do?
Would you like to go to the zoo with me?
Tom knew Mary was at work.
The peaches at the bottom of the basket are rotten.
Tom is the one who should be crying.
Where did you lose your umbrella?
Don't confuse desire with love.
Tom learned how to ride a bicycle from his older brother.
I'd have done that myself if I'd had the time.
I stayed home because of the weather.
Would you carry this upstairs for me?
It would be better to stay at home.
"They are leaving in three days, that is to say June 10th."
How can you say that?
Is your father's name Tom?
Why do you have three cars?
I'm pretty sure that Tom didn't do that.
I was very careful.
Give it to Tom.
Do you think you're ugly?
Tom lives on the third floor of this apartment building.
I thought I'd never see you alive again.
Where's the hammer you used?
I'm not sure I'd be much help.
I need a word with Tom.
I never heard him sing.
We were drunk.
Tom has three sisters.
I was fired.
Tom and Mary met at a party.
I refuse to be treated like a slave by you.
"Hey, I was going to call you."
I have a son about your age.
Bring me my glasses.
That's nearly impossible to determine.
I've always hated biology.
He doesn't like being told what to do.
Tom is unsatisfied with the results.
We've decided to get married.
Show me what to do.
Tom is your boss.
We've got everything.
Tom wanted to change his life.
The librarian told Tom and Mary to be quiet.
What do you have on the menu today?
Nobody offered Tom a seat.
Tom has traveled around the world.
Let's not talk about it any more.
I'll catch the 2:30 train.
I think that this is important.
She was over thirty when her artistic talent emerged.
I told Tom you were in Boston.
Be proud of yourself.
Did I give it to you?
Tom apologized to the families of the victims for the explosion at the factory.
Pink roses are beautiful.
I am studying.
Put yourself in my place.
I drink wine.
Please go faster.
I'm thinking of going to Australia.
You were here then.
You're extroverted.
Tom drowned his neighbor's cat.
I'll pretend that I didn't hear that.
I'm all right.
"In other words, he betrayed us."
Why are you so hard on yourself?
Tom slept without a blanket.
Could you tell me where Tom is?
Where's the ketchup?
Please come back this afternoon.
Tom was expelled from school.
I don't think that my life is boring.
We were winning.
These are really just excuses.
I'd like to see you again.
There's another possibility.
Mary is my grandmother.
Please wash your hands.
There's still a little milk left in this glass.
He was a soldier during the war.
Tom doesn't know I exist.
This is the very book that I want to read.
Are you listening closely?
"Turn the page, please."
There are many rivers in India.
"If you want to know the truth, ask Tom."
Tom took Mary along.
Get dressed.
Tom has never been absent from school.
Tom tells me we have a problem.
"Come here, young man."
They're probably already dead.
Tom often cries when he's drunk.
I'd like to go through just one day without being told I need to grow up.
I'm sorry Tom wasn't able to come.
I am not a student.
We know who they are.
He studied very hard to become a scientist.
That gives me hope.
"If Tom was planning to get married, he would've told me."
"Tom's a beginner, but he catches on fast."
The hunter shot at the bird.
Write the alphabet in capitals.
Make it larger.
You'd do the same for me.
Tom had a problem.
Will you do that?
I am happy to see you again.
I love that tradition.
You deserve to know the truth.
I plan to tell them about you.
He zipped up his jacket.
The sun gives light and heat.
I had no idea that Tom knew French.
He is flying to Paris tomorrow.
"First of all, you must look it up in the dictionary."
Do you remember that day?
Tom was enthusiastic.
Are you sure we can count on Tom?
They are my cousins.
That can have serious consequences.
He is not a smoker.
I'm inclined to think that you're right.
I'm surprised you didn't know that.
It's raining cats and dogs here.
I can't blame Tom for that.
What do you need to know?
There are many log cabins in these mountains.
I thought Tom would be at home.
You're a monster.
Did you paint this?
Don't let anything slow you down.
You're only making things worse.
Why did you become a lawyer?
We don't want anything from you.
Do what your father tells you to do.
Stay away from my daughter!
Mary does look a bit like Alice.
Raise your hands.
Will you marry me?
My dog is very intelligent.
Tom didn't even know that Mary had left.
Who's coming with us?
You should have kept it secret.
They accused him of telling a lie.
This is so pathetic.
The train stopped at a point halfway between the two stations.
The radio is broken.
Thank you for the beautiful flowers.
Old age isn't pleasant.
Are you surprised to see me here?
You don't need to reinvent the wheel.
Fill the bottle with water.
We followed the deer's tracks.
Give Tom your seat.
Please fasten your seat belt.
Do you think people will make fun of me?
Maybe I need a lawyer.
"Honey, are you hurt?"
Tom will only be here for three days.
I'm proud of you.
So what's on your mind?
It's good that you came.
Do you want me to help Tom?
Don't tell anyone.
Tom and I were neighbors.
We have a lot of things to do today.
We'll deal with this problem in Chapter 3.
Tom said it wasn't him who did that.
I play guitar almost every day.
We have to find out where Tom is.
Do you remember meeting me before?
There was nothing interesting in the newspaper.
I'm OK for now.
Tom moved back to Boston with his kids.
I think you need to eat more.
That's no reason to get angry.
Why are you holding a pair of scissors?
Tom was the one who asked all the questions.
Tom has lost hope.
The ice was thick enough to walk on.
Tom and Mary decided to play chess.
Tom started the car and drove off.
I need thread to sew on this button.
Tom looks like he's awake.
Aren't you glad we're here instead of Boston?
Just a minute.
How many kids did you see in the park?
I often play tennis with Tom.
Do you know how to eat with chopsticks?
I am busy now and can't play with you.
Tom tried to kiss Mary.
The car raised a cloud of dust.
I'll handle everything.
Why don't you call Tom and tell him what's going on?
"Tom isn't big, but he's strong."
I was in bed when you phoned.
Have you decided what to do yet?
Thank you for being here.
Why did Tom do that?
Do you have children's clothes?
Are you lucky?
Can I borrow it?
Tom wants to pay back the money he owes.
When will you be free?
How well do you know your kids?
May I use your car today?
Tom had trouble standing up.
I thought you already had a ticket.
I thought you'd seen this movie.
Tom didn't answer his phone.
Did you threaten Tom?
Cold numbs the limbs.
Are you having a good day?
Let me make you some coffee.
There were a lot of children in the park.
Reading books is very relaxing.
Let us know if you see Tom.
My brother skips school often.
Do you really want to know what I think?
Tom won't let you win again.
It's a lot of fun hanging out with Tom.
Tom isn't the one who make the rules.
You are hearing things.
The young adapt to change easily.
He has access to the American Embassy.
Don't ask me so many questions.
You are impossible.
I want a kitchen like this.
I don't think that they're bad people.
Can you loan me thirty dollars for a cab?
I think that Tom is afraid of your dog.
Tom said that was a good idea.
Tom won't tell us where he lives.
Don't forget to charge your cell phone.
Thanks for the soup.
Tom didn't feel safe in Boston.
It is not necessarily so.
I'm loved.
Tom has promised to go to Australia with me.
She made the doll for me.
Tom is likely to die.
That would be even better.
This is little different from what I want.
How many pens do you have?
The sick man's life is in danger.
This room will soon heat up.
We'll be happy to cooperate.
It was raining in Boston on Monday.
I know how I can help.
Both of the doors are open.
I have some things I need to do.
Cut them with a knife.
Mary used to be beautiful.
Is this your umbrella?
Tom was a janitor.
Tom knows wines.
The two sisters became more and more famous.
I helped my mother even though I was busy.
I'm extremely sorry.
Please call Tom.
I didn't know Tom spoke French so well.
The bride was radiant.
I would never let you down.
I wrote three letters last night.
Do you know how to drive a car?
Did you buy a dog?
I can't find a place to park.
Tom opened his notebook.
They were shocked.
I need one more.
"If you get bit by a rabid dog, you'll need a tetanus shot."
He's stupid.
I'll be in my lab.
I can't remember where I put my passport.
I study French at home.
"You want me to tell you it's OK, don't you?"
I postponed my trip because of the bad weather.
Tom told me to ask you.
Let me talk to Tom.
Don't you see what's happened?
You have to tell Tom what happened.
I think we need to talk.
Don't stand there.
Tom is Mary's mentor.
I saw Tom crossing the road.
Tom was very lucky.
You're too young to remember the nineties.
She told me not to go there alone.
"If you spend too much time in the sun without putting on sunscreen, you are likely to get a sunburn."
Tom didn't like my friends.
The man who wrote this book is a doctor.
Tom was the first to help Mary.
Tom looked where Mary was pointing.
I'd buy a new house if I had the money.
"Unfortunately, it's raining today."
I've advised Tom not to do that.
I'm a volleyball player.
How are you all?
I visited Australia.
Where are your sons?
Tom says that he loves Mary.
Why do you think Tom hates me?
I'd like to ask you for some advice.
I knew you'd come home.
I still go there once a week.
What're you doing here so late?
I'll be back in a few months.
I'll find them.
"You're a little older than Tom, aren't you?"
I do not want to reply to his letter.
We want to leave.
I like spending time with you.
I'm crafty.
Who asked you for help?
Why don't you go with us?
I know how much money you have in the bank.
"Tom wanted to leave, but Mary wanted to stay a little longer."
Take a look at yourself.
"You've been drinking, haven't you?"
May I come again?
This box is light enough to carry.
Tom lied to my face.
I can't believe Tom told you that.
Tom doesn't blame us.
I didn't think Tom was in Boston.
Tom was the one who suggested this.
Look at this picture.
How old are Tom and Mary?
Tom closed his eyes and began to count sheep.
I would've said no.
Point to the one you mean.
When was Tom arrested?
What did Tom decide to do?
The actress looks younger than she really is.
They want to help us.
"Don't you think if there were a problem, Tom would call us and let us know?"
I'd better drive you home.
Tom didn't know what had happened.
He advised her not to go.
Tom handed a knife to Mary.
The cat was licking its paws.
Are you hiding?
Tom told me that he was feeling better.
Don't you remember my name?
Guess what I want to do.
Where are you going to be tonight?
Are you telling me you don't know anything about this?
I was in my bedroom.
I can't wait to see your Halloween costume.
You can visit me tomorrow.
There wasn't even one book in the room.
Please write it down.
A burglar broke into his house.
Tom told me that he was wrong.
I didn't have the courage to tell her the truth.
He apologized to us for being late.
Tom was obviously tired.
"Frankly speaking, I don't like your idea."
Thank you again for your help.
I'm a redneck.
I'm resting now.
"Apparently, Tom doesn't like me."
Japan imports great quantities of crude oil.
Tom doesn't know yet.
Raising a child costs a fortune.
"Will you be going, too?"
Did you steal it?
We're useless.
I knew that you'd cry.
I didn't know you didn't know how to drive.
We're making progress.
I didn't clean the kitchen.
Yesterday I had a high fever.
Please wake up.
I'm going now.
Someone's at the door.
Tom asked Mary to turn the lights down.
I forbid you to do this.
"You are tired, aren't you?"
She did it again.
Tom and Mary are very old friends.
Let's do it my way.
Tom said that something wasn't right.
Would you like to dance with me?
Tom speaks French better than any of the other students in his class.
I could not help laughing when I saw him.
We have a lot of friends.
Tom wanted to stay a little longer.
Tom is doing something.
Is the bank open today?
My study is upstairs.
Tom watched Mary eat.
Stop talking about work.
Tom didn't need to go.
I can't say I'm sorry.
I'm glad to see you're OK.
I called you.
Tom said he knew that Mary would do that.
I need some cardboard boxes to pack my possessions.
Let me do it.
Tom got up before dawn.
Just follow them.
Tom left early in the morning.
How do you like the weather here?
Do you still work at the post office?
You smell bad.
Tom didn't want to be seen with Mary.
I may be back.
I'm happy because you're here.
I wondered why Tom wasn't drinking.
I became a director.
Do you want to be famous?
Tom opened the door to the office.
"When I left the house this morning, Tom was still sleeping."
Give me that one.
Let's have a bake sale.
Why don't you ask for a pay raise?
I hope that Tom waits for us.
"Some french fries, please."
I owe you $30.
Just give it to Tom.
This has to wait until tomorrow.
I thought everyone already knew this.
You still haven't done that.
I didn't know you were back in town.
I don't know how to get there.
I know where to find you.
He will arrive in Kyoto tomorrow.
Tom released Mary.
No one except Tom will be able to do that.
You came at the right time.
Tom started dancing to the music.
The question is whether Tom knew about it or not.
I closed the trunk.
"You do your job, I'll do mine."
It is not always easy to read between the lines.
Tom knows that he's right.
I missed you a lot.
My plan was very effective.
I know who Tom's sister is.
Will you come and see me?
Everyone looked at Tom.
I forgot to turn off the light.
They are going to exhibit many famous old paintings at the gallery.
How long will you wait?
I gave you my word.
We didn't recognize each other.
"The truth, as always, lies somewhere in the middle."
I couldn't get that song out of my mind.
Just wait for me there.
"If anyone has any problems, tell them to call me."
It's hard to believe that Tom wasn't aware that Mary was in love with him.
I liked them before they were popular.
Tom has a bad heart.
They're stuck.
What'll you do with it?
I read some books.
You have to study harder.
They went there.
How could you not know what was going on?
One person more or less doesn't make much difference.
He said that he gets up at 6 o'clock every day.
Tom was staring at Mary who was sitting on the school bus that was parked in front of the school.
Tom is losing them.
Fasten the rope to the tree.
The enemy is approaching rapidly.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I hadn't heard of it.
Here is your change.
I have another idea.
I knew I shouldn't have put off doing my homework until the last minute.
Who in your class is the best singer?
Tell Tom why you were fired.
Tom's wife died last week.
They were swearing at each other at the top of their voices.
Don't fool yourself. He doesn't love you.
You can go anywhere you like.
Most hotels provide a free shuttle bus.
I'll give you another minute.
Have you ever tasted anything Tom's cooked?
We all wish for permanent world peace.
Will you be at home next weekend?
Compare your answers with the teacher's.
It came out of nowhere.
How much are the pears?
Tom divorced his second wife last year.
This knife is so dull that it can't cut.
We had a mild winter last year.
No one was there except for Tom.
You sound like a broken record.
Which one do you like most?
Does Tom make his bed every morning?
"Whenever I meet her, she smiles at me."
Now isn't a very good time.
Please come back.
The flight attendant brought Tom a drink.
I won't do that now.
I'll monitor your progress from my computer.
I don't know where your painting is.
I wonder what scared Tom.
I have five more days.
Please don't do anything stupid.
Tom lives paycheck to paycheck.
Tom is going to be here.
I'll sign it tomorrow.
Tom rented a tuxedo.
Can I do it for you?
Tom still works for us.
"Tom stood up, but then sat down again."
Tom could've talked to me.
His wife nags him constantly.
He decided to quit smoking.
The building has been evacuated.
"Don't lie to me, Tom."
I don't think Tom knows why you want me to do that.
This is a good paper.
You're perfectly safe here.
I know Tom will be back soon.
Tom took Mary in his arms.
Nobody's watching us.
Why don't you tell Tom?
Tom asked Mary how much she'd paid for the sofa in her living room.
He cheated me.
I'll be home as soon as I can.
I'll call you.
It's raining now.
Tom stayed overnight in Boston.
Why is everybody looking at us?
You can always ask us for help.
Was Tom dating anyone?
I have no beef with Tom.
You could've been hurt.
I hear Tom doesn't drink beer.
This is my home now.
Make sure you tell Tom.
I didn't know you were going to be there.
Are you here to arrest me?
I spend too much time in front of my computer.
My father used to read me bedtime stories.
It'll be sunny.
Tom says Mary agreed to do that.
My hair is still wet.
We know him.
Tom said that he was really sleepy.
A boy of seventeen is often as tall as his father.
I'll tell you everything about it.
I'm sure glad no one was killed.
I'm studying French.
They laid the carpet on the floor.
Tom looks like he's going to cry.
How many pens did you buy?
Tom pushed Mary into the pool.
I never believed that.
Tell me what the problem is.
Where did Tom find those shoes?
Nobody ever talks about it.
All of my clothes are custom made.
They want to get married.
Tom usually watches the news while he's eating dinner.
I decided to try doing that by myself.
Tom moved to Boston last year.
I can't believe I forgot about that.
I'm planning to speak French.
Tom is still waiting for you downstairs.
It's balmy today.
They didn't say that.
I tried to avoid talking about that.
Does it work?
Tom plays the piano very well.
The sun disappeared behind the clouds.
I know that that isn't true.
She's five years younger than he is.
I don't want you to apologize.
Are you going to the post office?
This made me very sad.
I have some questions for you.
She cannot have broken her promise.
He turned pale when he heard that news.
It's a strange one.
China is much bigger than Japan.
I thought you didn't know Tom.
"You were telling the truth, weren't you?"
I want you to think about this again.
It looks like you're trying to hide something.
I saw a beautiful bird.
I'm afraid Tom will fail.
I remember seeing him somewhere before.
Tom worked all day yesterday.
Please do it.
We almost drowned.
My father warned me.
I knew you wouldn't sing.
She admitted to having heroin.
I don't want to answer that question.
You should take swimming lessons.
I have one green shirt.
Go brush your teeth.
I don't think that Tom has to go anywhere today.
I was really depressed.
Tom gave Mary a threatening look.
Tom is an adult.
How many children do Tom and Mary have?
I'll just go alone.
Tom has achieved very good results.
I tried to tell you.
"You've never forgiven me, have you?"
The pond dried up last summer.
Tom will stay with you.
Tom sometimes falls asleep in class.
"Of course, I'll marry you."
Let's hope Tom doesn't come.
"If by any chance Tom needs help, please help him."
I just want to see what happens.
Take this one.
We both agreed.
Where's the entrance to the museum?
We really hope another war will not break out.
Stay here with me.
Tom didn't say a word to us.
I'm going south.
Are we on speakerphone?
That meal was simply divine.
"We're ready, I think."
Tom wanted to make sure Mary was OK.
Do you have time the day after tomorrow?
I found my friends at the cafe.
You are not a doctor.
Just do what I tell you to do.
Do you want to buy a dress?
Tom has met Mary many times.
Who cares what Tom says?
Nobody will believe that.
Come back and pick me up later.
One of my brothers is a teacher.
You owe me something.
I like watermelon.
Why aren't you with me?
I don't drink tea.
I wish that I hadn't married you.
I don't need a lecture.
"The famous building, the Taj Mahal, is in India."
I have nightmares.
They give presents to one another.
What have you seen?
Tom and Mary went on a shopping spree.
I want to watch a documentary.
I wanted to become a doctor.
What was Tom accused of?
We need to think about it.
"If you don't want to go, just say so."
I knew how to keep a secret.
I think I'd better go with you.
I mowed Tom's lawn.
May I stay with you for a while?
I agree with his opinion.
Tom and Mary look surprised.
I want to get home before 2:30.
You need to learn to laugh at yourself.
You've said that to me before.
We won't have time to do that.
My window was closed.
Some bugs were fixed.
You made a mistake.
Someone opened the window.
Tom is used to hard work.
"The baby can't walk, much less run."
He knows how to speak to children.
I was made to go there.
We saw Tom.
Tom needs something to do.
"I don't know anyone here, except for Tom."
I do this for the fun of it.
It wasn't as easy to do that as I expected.
Do you want me to stay with Tom?
I don't need your money.
We have things to do.
Please take another one.
I'm too tired to think.
Tom asked me why I didn't ask anybody for help.
This park is famous for its roses.
Tom turned down my proposal.
I opened the gate.
Can Tom afford that?
He cannot afford it.
Tom is always reading.
Tom just had a stroke.
We don't know who did that.
Tom thought about Mary a lot.
Are you going to work today?
Go to sleep.
The police found drugs on the bus and detained all the passengers.
You shouldn't drink this water.
He will soon get used to the class.
I told Tom to speak French.
How long have you been in Boston?
They agreed to it.
Why are you apologizing?
"If you want to really improve your French, you should move to a country where it's spoken."
Can you park here?
I unplugged the TV.
Do you have any brothers?
I know this.
"If I had known it, I would have told you."
The sheep in the field are eating grass.
It's better to wait for the police to arrive.
I remember something.
"If you want me to stay, just tell me."
You have to do this yourself.
I think you know I like you a lot.
Did you remember to buy flowers for Mary?
Tom couldn't get the jar open.
I said I'd wait for you.
Go and brush your teeth.
The difference in our ages is not significant.
The battle lasted a week.
We were just hanging out.
Tom bought a hot dog for Mary.
I think we should stick to the plan.
Did Tom say anything?
What should I have done in that situation?
Where did you put my keys?
When is Tom busy?
"Yes, we can go."
I won't make that mistake again.
Tom might know something we don't.
I've been asked to sing tonight.
You have to hurry if you want to go with them.
Mary is a cheerleader.
We're the best.
"I'm sorry, I don't have time to help you today."
How come he didn't show up?
She took a taxi to the hospital.
Tom doesn't celebrate birthdays.
Tell me about your trip to Australia.
You're free to say what you think.
Tom is not as old as you.
Do you suffer from seasonal allergies?
Tom was hospitalized.
I'll ask Tom for permission.
This is excellent wine.
Tom is often in trouble with the law.
I'd like to work with you.
She looks beautiful in that dress.
I can't buy a book this expensive.
Please cut the pizza into three slices.
I'll tell you what's wrong.
How did Tom convince Mary to marry him?
I have no authority to do that.
I often play football after school.
Did you pass all your exams?
Tom and Mary wanted some time alone.
How old were you when you got married?
"Where there's life, there's hope."
Nobody paid me anything.
Why are you always avoiding me?
Tom nodded.
He's out of position.
We've talked about that a lot.
I'm proud to be a Canadian.
Did you hear what I said?
Just a moment ...
I was nervous and scared.
Tom is refusing to help us.
Put out the light.
Why are you alone?
Tom is in the other room.
Tom would lend you money if he had any.
How often do you check your email?
I can get the tickets for you.
What do we do now?
You have to stop drinking.
My brother watches television.
Tom wasn't home.
This hotel has a magnificent view of the sea.
Tom and Mary aren't always right.
I'm concerned with Tom's safety.
I want to know you're safe.
Please don't leave without us.
Tom was too tired to go any further.
Don't stand there.
I know the score.
Mary was the prettiest girl that Tom had ever seen.
Did you find another picture?
Inhale through your nose.
Tom's eyes are huge.
How much longer do you expect me to wait for you?
My sister showed a new watch to me.
This is our problem.
Please speak a little more slowly.
I'm glad you're staying.
I'll go talk to Tom.
Promise me you'll never do that again.
Tom feels better now.
We must get back to the ship.
I didn't want to waste so much time.
Tom will do anything we want him to do.
How many professional musicians do you think there are in Boston?
Tom won't be back before 2:30.
I don't want Tom to be alone.
I'm ready to follow you.
They won't be needing that.
I didn't want it.
I've already decided where I'm going to go.
Was I talking to you?
I use the Internet as a resource for my research.
Tom refused to budge.
Is Tom really happy?
My toy is broken.
Why don't you get a haircut?
I can't say exactly what the problem is.
Who's sick?
Where's the nearest gas station around here?
How could they not know?
You're not yourself today.
Tom wanted to know what to do next.
You need to press the button.
They were almost starving.
Where is that?
Tom must have seen me.
There's something about Tom that makes a lot of girls like him.
They both looked at Tom.
I was going to wash my hair.
Enjoy the moment.
Tom said that he thought that we might have a problem.
Stay calm.
I wish he had gone on to university.
Are you sure this plan will work?
Find out who they are.
It's not for everyone.
When was the last time you did this?
I believe in the immortality of the soul.
"You don't have a key, do you?"
Tom should be fired.
Some people have no patience.
The vegetation was thick and lush.
That's a fir tree.
Drink less and sleep more.
Tom and Mary were friends.
Go and apologize to Tom.
"Will you go, too?"
I nodded and left.
Tom went to the same school as Mary did.
The people crowded around the boy.
We both know that's unlikely to happen.
Tom bought three bottles of red wine.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
How do you know Tom is bluffing?
I can't stand it anymore.
Give her a doll.
Tom asked Mary what was wrong.
Tom has been bitten by Mary's dog many times.
We were both drunk.
Where's the bucket?
Tom lives in an old building on Park Street.
Did you discover something new today?
The road was very bumpy.
He hesitated before answering.
You've lost weight.
Old people are usually very wise.
Can anybody else answer?
I walk to school every morning.
We'll go see Tom.
Do you have any advice for me?
What's in the bottle?
None of Tom's relatives came to his funeral.
Tom is rolling in money.
I don't think that I know the answer to that question.
I take dance lessons.
No one will hurt you.
What makes you think that I don't want to go?
Tom says he's not busy.
She dashed downstairs.
I haven't graduated yet.
That is rather unexpected.
Tom didn't apologize to Mary for doing that.
Can't you vacuum later?
That's Tom's umbrella.
Tom's house doesn't have running water.
How many photos are in this album?
Tom chuckled to himself.
They want to be with you.
I am building a wall.
You're vain.
That's the fastest train in the world.
Tom and Mary both screamed.
Tom is tidy.
I'm having a great time.
I'll find out what's going on.
I need to know what you saw that night.
Anybody can use it.
Stop scowling.
Tom can't run as fast as he used to.
Can you come closer?
I don't think it's a good decision.
Tom is sitting in the corner.
Do they know?
I'll call Tom and apologize.
Why do onions make you cry?
Tom is walking slowly.
It's for my friend.
Just don't tell Tom.
Tom slipped on a banana peel.
Tom is a third-year student.
I have no idea what I'm doing.
He's had many unhappy experiences.
"Since my room faces south, it isn't so cold even in the winter."
I want to finish what I started here.
I solved the problem easily.
It's Tom's first time here.
Get your friend to help you.
What I'm saying is quite true.
Could this be love?
Can I ask you why?
Tom depends on Mary too much.
You're confusing me with someone else.
I missed you so much.
Don't make me do this.
He sacrificed his own life to save them.
See you in French class.
This is perfectly legal.
Tom made me get out of bed.
"Unfortunately, Tom wasn't wearing a life jacket."
I enjoy running.
Money talks.
Tom doesn't think this is such a good idea.
She'll try it once more.
They have a lot of talent.
I intend to stay a whole week.
The meeting will take place next Sunday.
The food in this restaurant is very expensive.
I got it for nothing.
Please phone me before you come.
We won't lose.
Are you going to attend ceremony?
Please do this for me.
She guaranteed his debts.
What Tom did was incredible.
I have a very pretty girlfriend.
Tom was real happy.
Sit down now.
It's never too late to start.
I want to buy a yacht.
Tom is going to Nîmes tomorrow.
Tom tried to talk to us in French.
I like sweets.
Tom is still angry with you.
How come you didn't do that?
Translate this into French.
I don't want to forget anything.
Why don't you want to go?
Tom got fat.
We split up the loot three ways.
I'll buy some ice cream.
How young is too young?
What's your new address?
What made you go into the basement?
My wife is a vegetarian.
Tom is disgusting.
Why didn't you stay in Boston?
I can't go on without Tom.
I'll phone you later.
There's a lot of work to do.
Tom thanked Mary for coming.
Never say that.
The air mainly consists of oxygen and nitrogen.
Try on that shirt. It's made of fine cotton.
He's a member of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.
A taxi from the airport costs about $30.
I've been waiting for him for an hour.
You aren't ready for this.
The furniture was covered in dust.
I didn't get the joke.
Tom has finally forgiven me.
I lied to you.
I like to draw.
Tom is now very angry with me.
My father made me a delicious lunch.
I'll buy that.
Even Tom can swim.
I can't give you this.
I had a little bit of a fever this morning.
Tom hated that.
I don't think that it's my fault.
Bring a warm sweater.
The plane arrived at New York on schedule.
I heard everything you said.
Tom saw Mary.
Where do you usually go to get a haircut?
Tom got in the bathtub.
"I have a test today, too."
There's nothing wrong with Tom.
I have no time to engage in political activity.
Search every room.
I'm okay.
Have you got a match?
I thought you'd probably already gone home.
Don't ask me such a hard question.
Tom isn't thirty yet.
I have a prior engagement.
Mary is the only woman that I've ever been in love with.
You're a prude.
Tom said that he was getting sleepy.
Who bought you this?
Leave us.
I need evidence.
Tom says he really likes it here.
Why didn't somebody help Tom?
The boy left his homework half-finished.
Promise me you won't tell Tom.
I'll have what you're having.
Tell me the reason why Tom was fired.
Tom left Boston three days ago.
You're confusing me with Tom.
The doctor advised me that I should go on a diet.
I thought I recognized you.
We've finished cleaning our classroom.
Tom offered me a cup of coffee.
I hate it when guys do that.
Do you wash your hands before eating?
He told me that his father was dead.
I'm not sure what Tom wants.
How did you get to know her?
Tom's family needed money.
Everybody was interested in the story.
Tom isn't the kind of man who would say that kind of thing.
I was meaning to call you.
I think you should read it yourself.
Where did you get it?
Tom is really a good worker.
Tom has told me about you.
Tom cleared his throat.
Did you think Tom would win?
Why do you want me to leave?
The water pipes froze and then burst.
Who do you think it is?
Do you know Tom's secret?
Our offer still stands if you're interested.
That's the only reason Tom and I are going.
It's under the chair.
Have you ever been to Europe?
Tom thinks he's better at French than he really is.
This book was very interesting.
May I visit you tomorrow?
Tom is sure Mary was lying.
Tom thought that Mary was talking about John.
Tom and I never should've done that.
I can't disagree with that.
I always wanted to be rich and famous.
Tom will unlikely want to go anywhere with Mary.
Children need a lot of sleep.
I'll phone you as soon as I get to the airport.
Just three kilometers past my house is complete wilderness.
Is it going to happen?
The Nile River is the longest in the world.
How would you have answered that question?
Fry us some eggs.
My husband and I have a joint bank account.
I'm playing a TV game.
Tom kept his eyes shut.
I didn't want to sell my land.
I thought you already knew.
Tom sat facing Mary.
Tomorrow's another day.
I really want to go home.
She looks a lot like her mother.
Are you free after school?
There are five fish in my aquarium.
This CD belongs to my son.
Tom doesn't like jazz.
Tom told me he spoke French.
Now give me the list.
I won't lower myself to his level.
Can I open the window?
Your seat's there.
Do you know the way?
Tom is still upstairs.
Tom is more experienced than me.
I didn't go there myself. I sent Tom.
It's what I like.
Those shoes are a perfect match for this white skirt.
Why don't we eat out at a restaurant for a change?
"My brother bought a used car, so it wasn't very expensive."
Tom explained the joke to Mary.
I'll make you some tea.
"You aren't really going to kill Tom, are you?"
Your friends will miss you.
What were you waiting for?
I'm only joking.
Is there something that you want?
You can't go out.
Tom is like a father to me.
They asked for my opinion.
You'll always be part of the family.
We heard the bomb go off.
My hobbies are fishing and watching television.
They announced the date of their wedding in the newspaper.
Tom usually stays at five-star hotels.
Is Tom going to buy this?
Didn't you lock up your car?
Tom and I weren't friends.
Are those bedbugs?
I could change that.
What did you do on the weekend?
Your sudden appearance surprised me.
I knew Tom wasn't going to win.
Do you believe this is true?
I put my hat on.
I'm all ears.
I learned to dance when I was thirteen.
Tom is a typical Canadian.
I feel like singing in the rain.
Misfortunes always come in threes.
Many people like to travel.
I want to please you.
Tom is watching Mary.
Tell me who you are.
Do you think I need to go?
Tom is as smart as his sister.
We actually saw the accident.
Tom's grandfather was a soldier.
Tom told me not to open that door.
I'd like you to translate this into French.
Tom found a hundred dollar bill on the street.
Tom now knows the truth about what happened.
Are we in trouble?
You know that that isn't true.
"Run fast, otherwise you will miss the bus."
We'll continue to work on that.
Do you think you'll need more time?
I completely forgot about her.
Don't scream.
You'll need to transfer to another bus at the next stop.
What do you know about Boston?
He lives across the street.
I thought that you said that Tom needed more time.
Doing that would be very scary.
I was a teacher for fifteen years.
I haven't done very much this year.
Do you know where Tom bought his bicycle?
Tom dug a deep hole in the garden.
Wounded bears are usually very dangerous.
It happened just the way you predicted.
You're a hunk.
Are you saying that you don't remember?
What's your home address?
"As far as I know, she hasn't left yet."
She is trying to prove the existence of ghosts.
We didn't want Tom to leave.
Did you hear Tom is in town?
Write your name.
What's your relationship with your father like?
Horses eat grass.
Tom asked Mary if she needed a ride home.
Tom ironed his shirt.
I've got evidence.
Tom wasn't able to do it.
I told you this was a good idea.
Tom gets the same salary as I do.
He trained very hard.
Tom and Mary didn't tell anyone they were planning to do that.
We want the same thing.
Why are people scared of you?
My youngest sister sings very well.
I live in this hotel.
Tom is a rebellious boy.
What happened that day?
How many people want to go swimming with us?
Tom heard a familiar voice.
I always knew I could do it.
Just put yourself in my shoes.
Tell me which one to choose.
I'd like you to translate this book into English.
Tom got no reply.
Thanks for telling us that.
He is probably still alive.
He earns a great deal.
Do you think Tom will die?
Tom doesn't want to apologize to Mary for doing that.
Tom hopes Mary knows what to buy.
He ran at the sight of the policeman.
I don't think Tom knows why Mary did that.
It's late. I have to go.
"Tom is celebrating, isn't he?"
I know how hard this is.
My boss is twice as old as I am.
I got the money.
Tom will have to do that next week.
Mary isn't like the other girls in the class.
The hot bath relaxed her.
I don't believe a word you say.
I think that Tom should do that by himself.
I have done it.
She always carries a Bible.
Maybe I'm losing my mind.
Try it yourself.
Can you help me do this?
They don't have a car.
Tom came in through a secret door in the wall.
They were school children then.
We just couldn't say no.
That can be done.
Has he written the letter yet?
You'll find this lesson easy.
I need to renew my subscription.
Do you speak French every day?
We have done nothing.
Do you think Tom was murdered?
We have to try.
I don't want to hear this.
Is the work hard?
Tom was fired on October 20th.
I could have been injured.
Be yourself.
They have nowhere else to go.
Can I go with you?
Leave us alone and we'll leave you alone.
Horses eat grass.
I will try again.
Leave it closed.
Tom is looking for a way to make some money.
I didn't invite you.
I saw something white in the park.
I didn't see anything strange.
What is your astrological sign?
The novel takes place in Victorian England.
"Although it is a very difficult task, I will do my best."
Tom got out of jail on October 20th.
Tom admitted that it was a stupid idea.
There are many sights to see in Kyoto.
"Tom has big, blue eyes."
I've been warned.
Tom became a Canadian citizen.
Don't come here again.
There's something weird happening.
Tom has my book.
He seldom gives his wife presents.
Nobody's going to blame you.
What happened to Tom and Mary?
I won't bother you again.
Dinner will be ready when you arrive.
My parents don't want me to get married.
Is this what you want?
How can you be so naive?
I know a lot of people.
Tom has lost his hearing.
I had to tell somebody.
We'll be ready when you get back.
Tom said that he couldn't believe it.
Did Tom see you come in?
She has brought up five children.
Tom's hair is chestnut brown.
It doesn't have to happen again.
His English is quite good.
I almost never get sick.
We have to figure out a way to encourage Tom to do the right thing.
I wouldn't want to tell him the truth.
I bought it for you.
I love you more than her.
Tom forgot to do his French homework.
Are you sure you know what Tom wants?
Tom knows how to have a good time.
Tom isn't a gentleman.
He denied that he knew that man.
How long have you been here?
I can't get the door unlocked.
Have you ever seen snow?
Give me your book.
It seems that they have quarreled.
I'm here with a friend.
Do you know why Tom decided to do that?
Their price is below ours.
I bought a book about animals.
We stayed at our uncle's.
He was having lunch when I entered the room.
We never should've done that.
Tom is going to leave in thirty minutes.
I got a flat tire on my way home.
I was bewildered.
Tom and Mary were planning to do that.
Are you feeling a little better now?
Tom asked me to wait here.
Please turn down the radio.
"Where were you when your wife disappeared, Tom?"
Take one of these.
I think you need to call Tom.
Please read that book.
Tom is selling his house.
I need this more than you.
He suddenly noticed his wallet was missing.
I went there for the purpose of meeting him.
It is their right to vote.
Someone could be watching us.
Tell Tom you're not ready.
Tom wanted to talk to you.
I'll never forget our first date.
The submarine finally came to the surface.
He started to sing.
The lawyer believed in his client's innocence.
I don't know how to play golf.
I'll take you there.
"Sorry, I am late."
Tom sat back down.
Tell them to stop.
Nobody can replace Tom.
I have a car.
Hold the rope.
The contest ends tomorrow.
We didn't intend to attack him.
I can't promise that.
Prepare yourself for the future.
I think you know where we need to go.
"Dinner is probably ready, so we had better hurry home."
You won't have a chance.
Tom told me I'm last.
She wants to marry her daughter to a doctor.
Let's drink some water.
Tom has really helped me.
I tore the picture out of the album.
I love this song.
Tom wanted to talk to a lawyer.
I wasn't hungry anyway.
It's thirty degrees below zero.
Tom wasn't ever in Boston.
Do you have that bottle?
Tom noticed a change.
Tom said he didn't go to Boston anymore.
His mother speaks Italian.
Everybody danced.
Tom looked through the binoculars.
Try this candy.
Try not to be so pessimistic.
I hate mice.
We don't have any milk.
What's Tom waiting for?
I know you can make it better.
"It's a secret, I guess."
He brushes his teeth.
We don't have class today.
Do you go to Boston often?
Don't you want to know what Tom really thinks of you?
She was injured in a car accident.
I'm not a boy anymore.
We don't want to do that.
I think it's time I left.
Is eating meat morally wrong?
"Tom is fishing, too."
French is not only spoken in France.
Tell Tom it wasn't my fault.
You drive me crazy.
We were all happy.
Tom was all worn out.
Don't get up.
I slept for nine hours.
Tom is much younger than Mary.
You'll have to pay double.
Tom must've missed the train.
I don't want to go with Tom.
Tom doesn't want an iPad. He wants a portable device that supports Flash.
It was a great plan.
Let's wait an hour.
Tom wasn't a good boxer.
Did you get married?
Tom is going to investigate.
Click on the link.
I forgot my scarf.
I don't think that we need to buy this.
Wait a moment.
Tom knows Mary likes reggae.
What did you show Tom?
I've been here since yesterday.
I've been here for a year.
She was wearing a beautiful dress.
Whose side is Tom on?
Was that all you wanted to ask me?
Tom has a weight problem.
It has a refreshing taste.
The hotel was evacuated.
I've been wanting to ask you out for a long time.
You can ask him for help.
I haven't received any messages.
My family isn't that large.
Tom didn't want to be eaten by wolves.
You should observe the school rules.
Let's see what's in the box.
I was late for work yesterday.
"Tom, there's something you need to know."
Have you ever thought about moving to Boston?
Tom said Mary wouldn't win.
"Tom is in his room, listening to the radio."
Tom has asked us to help him.
Tom always comes at 2:30.
Tom asked Mary to throw the rotten apple into the garbage.
What you do with them is up to you.
Tom is so selfish.
Do you know how to deactivate a bomb?
Who are you going out with?
I don't think I'll ever be able to do that by myself.
You need to talk to Tom personally.
When were you born?
They're going crazy.
"Because of the heavy fog, we could barely see the road in front of us."
It'll take us at least three hours to finish this.
We did a lot of good things.
Tom took a sip of wine.
We're closed today.
Tom's clothes are dirty.
Tom was not able to quit smoking.
Is that all you want to say?
Why did they do it?
Tom called Mary to tell her that he might need her help later in the afternoon.
French is a very beautiful language.
"You are satisfied with your life, aren't you?"
Tom is ready.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
You need to write it yourself.
My band will perform this week at Chuck's Bar and Grill. Please come and see us.
Tom had cancer.
They seem happy.
What have you gotten me into?
What time is it by your clock?
I think he's lying.
Why did you get so angry?
There is something about him I don't like.
Tom is living by himself.
They had been saving money for the trip for a year.
I knew you wouldn't be late.
Our best friend is a doctor.
I still can't believe you're married.
How did you know one was missing?
You surprised me.
Where's your hotel?
I want you to help me.
I've thought about that a lot.
It has happened.
I think I'll take it.
"Hurry up, otherwise you'll be late for lunch."
How can you help me?
It's easy for Tom to make friends.
I have it.
The time will come when she'll regret it.
Tom said that he was happy.
My customers never complain.
My father is frank.
Never keep a lady waiting.
I can't wait to see you.
The car jack was on the table.
You are what you are.
I lost ten kilos in three months.
Didn't you know that Tom was going to be in Australia all week?
She watched him eat.
"Tom wanted to give you a surprise party, but I knew you'd hate it, so I told him not to."
How do they feel?
All we can do is wait for him.
I'm very excited to be back.
Tom bought a bar of chocolate.
It seemed strange.
Tom is clearly in love.
Have you ever been to Tom's home?
I thought you knew Tom.
I will write to you next week.
I wish I hadn't gone there with Tom.
We know that you lied to us.
You have a very nice smile.
I promised not to tell anyone how much we paid to have our house painted.
Tom opened the door.
Tom almost died after eating the mushrooms Mary had gathered.
They are sitting at the table.
Tom won't help you.
Don't you like baseball?
Let's see what can be done.
"Tom, hold your horses."
Tom may sit in the back if he wants to.
"Are you leaving, too?"
We aren't Canadians.
Tom got Mary some chocolate.
Tom decided to enter the room.
Tom knows how to open this door.
Tom was with us.
You've already won.
Tom is an ophthalmologist.
Take a look around you.
I don't think Tom needs to show Mary how to do that.
You need to pay attention.
Do you use solar panels?
We all make mistakes.
I was only there for three hours.
I love both of you with all my heart.
It was some time before he realized his mistake.
My internet connection is slow.
Tom came after Mary left.
Why didn't you go home?
He would let me help him.
Tom told Mary that he couldn't do what she asked him to do.
Tom told me who I should talk to.
That's very true.
He slept well last night.
I've got to see it.
Tom didn't even slow down.
Tom didn't want to discuss the problem with Mary.
Tom has too many enemies.
Just take mine.
Tom said the explosion woke him up.
I just want you to tell Tom what you told me.
I just can't endure it any more.
He didn't keep his word.
Would I deceive you?
This dress will look good on you.
They forced her to confess.
I usually watch TV in the evening.
You'll have to drive us there.
His cottage is on the coast.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
It's hard to quit smoking.
"Oh, I just remembered. Tom left you a message."
Tom left at midnight.
I wonder why Tom quit his job.
It was a long day.
We had to cooperate with each other.
I didn't know you weren't Canadian.
My cup's empty.
Did you ever tell anybody about what happened?
We don't have answers.
My watch loses two minutes a day.
Why did you agree?
Tom didn't seem to be sleeping.
Tom knew that was going to be arrested.
Tom likes this game.
Tom painted these walls last week.
I just want to take a quick look.
This box isn't so heavy.
Should I speak French?
She translated that word for word.
Did you know that Tom had relatives in Australia?
The problem is that Tom is just as scared as I am.
I want you to stay with Tom.
Did you notice that?
I want to keep working for Tom.
Tom closed his eyes and drifted off to sleep.
Where should I wait for you?
I know what the problem is.
We should call Tom immediately.
I want to do that very much.
Are these pencils yours?
I think it's an excellent idea.
I doubt if he is a lawyer.
Do it later.
I know I deserve this.
"Wait your turn, Tom."
We both need this.
Give me a little time.
Who'll eat the rest?
I think I'm getting a cold.
Do you have a house?
I've made peace with my maker. I'm ready to die.
"I thought I could do it, but it was more difficult than I expected it to be."
"To tell the truth, I don't like translating."
We missed you.
How was your meeting?
These pictures are amazing.
We don't know where we want to go.
Tom put his wallet on the desk.
I like it.
I broke my right leg.
You remind me of my mother.
Take a look at this.
I usually eat three times a day.
She employed a private detective to keep a watch on her husband.
Tom cut some branches off the apple tree.
Did I do something stupid?
"From space, the earth looks quite small."
Tom broke Mary's expensive Chinese Ming vase.
I was aware of being watched.
I'm the one who's sick.
I think Tom didn't understand you.
Let's go to Tom's place.
Tom tried to catch the mouse.
Saddam rejected the demand.
Please forgive me for not answering your letter.
Tom's dangerous.
Tom and I plan to have three children.
Tom needs to get some rest.
My mother is cooking breakfast.
Something unexpected has happened.
I think we should all be worried a little bit about the way Tom has been acting lately.
She slapped his face.
Nothing was to be seen but water.
Where did you live?
Tom will help Mary tomorrow.
You haven't convinced me yet.
French isn't my native language.
I have a bit of a cold.
Tom told me he wanted to cry.
I can't pay the rent.
"Excuse me, I'm lost."
It's dark outside.
Look at the picture.
I came to save you.
What're you doing up here?
You know how Tom is.
Tom lost confidence in himself.
Could we meet again?
What do you usually have for dinner?
Don't cut in while we're talking.
It needs washing.
Are you saying you can't fix it?
I think we can catch Tom.
I hope you had a nice trip.
There were too many sights to see in a day or two.
My cholesterol levels are high.
These earphones don't work.
Tom wants his parents to buy him a pony.
I shouldn't have gone home late at night by myself.
Tom is just wasting time.
Will you be in Boston this weekend?
She was born and brought up in Osaka.
I'll dance with you.
Do you think I'm lying?
He is very slow at making friends with anybody.
How did you know where to find us?
Tom doesn't want to appear weak.
Father has given up smoking for his health.
He bought a pair of shoes.
I just want to make Tom happy.
Please don't follow this advice.
Luckily nobody got shot.
Tom is now somewhere in Australia.
Do you talk to your cats?
I'd like to go swimming this afternoon.
They're not your friends anymore.
Hard work is the price of success.
Tom ate a piece of the cake that Mary baked.
There's a lot of work to do.
That's a very personal question.
You can come tomorrow.
I wonder whether or not Tom is asleep.
Didn't you know Tom had a house in Australia?
I love going to the beach.
The main line runs through Boston.
She chose the red dress.
Who is the man that you were talking with?
What would you do if you were here now?
It's all in your imagination.
They leave tomorrow.
I think he will soon catch up with us.
He is very sociable.
Tom wasn't my husband at that time.
I trust you.
"Until yesterday, I had never heard Tom speak French."
Did you show it to your parents?
Badgers dig deep holes.
Where's the bank?
Tom's gone.
I know that's true.
You can come.
I'll be waiting with Tom.
Tom is happy.
Do you think I'm lying?
I can't change these plans.
Does Tom know what happened?
I think you had better take a rest.
Stop beating around the bush and tell me what happened.
I had to lie to Tom.
It'll be dark by the time I get home.
When do you work?
Are you twins?
This area has changed a lot.
Tom was at school all day.
It's going to be hot.
Are you giving up so soon?
Something is wrong with the engine of my car.
I cannot afford a camera above 300 dollars.
Can you lend me a dollar?
Are you talking about Tom or yourself?
Tom and Mary played in the sandbox together and made sand castles.
Tom speaks highly of you.
You don't look like you're having any fun.
I'd say no if I were you.
I like winter.
His hands were empty.
Tom said he'd stay there till 2:30.
How did you know Tom was going to go to Boston with Mary?
It's still raining.
Tom said that he was really unhappy.
Tom told me he wanted to change his name.
Why did you agree to do that?
Tom frightened me.
Tom could've been one of us.
Has anybody done that?
I was with Tom for an hour.
The invitation said to bring your significant other.
I had a chance to meet him in Paris.
Tom is new in town.
I'm glad you're pleased.
I have to talk to you about Tom.
Tom seemed to be a bit disappointed.
I'm sorry you didn't get a chance to meet Tom.
I wanted Tom to drive.
It was his silence which made her angry.
Bring her here.
You're my friend.
Tom needs treatment.
What did they tell you?
I will take it.
I wanted to help.
Tom is having problems at school.
Look at this photograph.
I wake up at 7 o'clock.
Why don't you do it yourself?
I know more about Tom than he realizes.
Tom left the gate open.
Tom yelled at Mary.
I think we just have to be patient.
Who else might've done it?
First impressions can often be misleading.
Every privilege carries responsibility with it.
Tom is definitely not having much fun.
He is as strong as ever.
Tom doesn't look like either of his parents.
Why was Tom punished?
Are you really my sister?
Power is the great aphrodisiac.
He's an aristocrat.
I want to invite you to a party.
We finally got rid of our old car.
I didn't want to waste so much time.
I wish you had told me.
I met an old student of mine in London.
How did you know his name was Tom?
What color car did you buy?
Their car overtook ours.
I've brought you a gift.
"Tom was lying in bed, staring up at the ceiling."
We have just returned from a trip around the world.
I know that Tom is in bed.
He is my teacher.
Tom will be at work Monday.
I didn't expect that result.
I asked Tom to keep quiet.
I believe this fish is a freshwater fish.
Tom knew he wouldn't win.
This bird can't fly.
Tom is hesitating.
Don't buy that book.
I had to agree.
I can't stay here any longer.
Let me tell you everything I know.
I want to find Tom.
Tom was the last person off the bus.
You won't be happy there.
Do you get up early in the morning?
He's my old friend.
We see what we want to see.
Tom is the guy who helped Mary.
I can't go alone.
This is my cousin.
The roses in my garden are beautiful.
The concert's over.
I don't like children.
I've never told this to anyone.
I've heard it said that it's harder to please a woman than to please a man. I wonder if that's true.
Have you already eaten dinner?
I broke a nail.
I think everybody knows that.
Where is his family?
I told them not to tell you.
Asia is much larger than Australia.
I can't go to work today because I have the flu.
Tom told us where to find Mary.
She suggested that I go to the store with him.
When will we drive home?
Are you still angry with me?
You'll make it.
My father is in prison.
You should spend more time with Tom.
Tom and Mary are almost ready.
Your income is about twice as large as mine.
Tom plans to go there alone.
I've never been in prison.
What time did Tom leave?
I'm writing a letter.
Tom has started crying.
I was stupid enough to believe Tom.
Who knows what happened?
Tom got angry with us.
Tom seems much happier than Mary.
Do you know how many eggs Tom bought?
We forgot all about Tom.
Tom still doesn't look very happy.
We can't give you your job back.
Tom wasn't even able to stand.
"I can't go with you next weekend, but I can the weekend after next."
Tom didn't get a reply.
Your seat's there.
She's very wise.
I think Tom might know something.
What do you usually do on weekends?
Was there an investigation?
Compare your answer with Tom's.
Tom apologized for his mistake.
I thought Tom would be able to help you.
Could I borrow a pencil?
Don't come in my room without knocking.
Where exactly do you live?
The house I'm living in isn't very large.
That's what Tom is afraid of.
Do you think we have a chance to win?
We've got to fix some things.
You can use my car today.
I will be watching TV about this time tomorrow.
Most people studying a foreign language will never be able to speak like a native speaker.
I want to brush up my English.
There's no solution.
No one has been convicted of the crime yet.
How's your job?
I never would've guessed.
I'm sure you meant well.
Tom gave Mary a gift.
Tom and Mary are close relatives.
They've both been released from prison.
I'm calling to thank you.
"I didn't know you needed one, too."
I don't think that anybody else noticed what Tom was doing.
Tom went on eating.
Are those people terrorists?
Tom and I became friends.
Tom often plays tennis after school.
Let me go to Boston with you.
I don't know exactly where I was born.
I really hope not.
Would you buy one?
I'm trying my best to forget that ever happened.
Don't you want to go with me?
I wonder if Tom misses me.
Everyone laughed at my idea.
Will you tell him about it when he comes home?
How much money did you lose?
I think you've made the wrong decision.
Was Tom angry?
He didn't see anybody.
Tom reserved a seat.
Where do you intend to spend your vacation?
Are you going there on business?
I'm going to report you to police.
Tom was spoiled.
"Give me a break, will you?"
Tom told Mary that he was planning to go swimming with John.
The police haven't ruled out suicide.
This is more like a liquid than a facial cream. That makes it easy to use.
I don't think I can find the time to do that today.
They're all watching TV.
You made a good decision.
Can you tell me what's going on here?
Tom used to play both baseball and basketball.
I was the one who told Tom to come here.
I've never been to Europe.
Is this your bike?
Tom is with his girlfriend.
There's milk in the fridge.
I told you not to go by yourself.
Let me alone.
Your friend's in the other room.
She was advised by him to give up smoking.
It's dark in here. Do you have a flashlight?
Let's start at 2:30.
I can't remember his explanation.
Did you really think I wouldn't do that?
They have three children.
Tom retired.
Tom needs a transfusion.
Do you need an extra blanket?
My wife told me to throw this old hat away.
"Some people write books for money, others for pleasure."
My wife is obsessed with cleanliness.
Tom has no reason to cry.
Our ship is badly damaged.
Tom did it a few times.
"Tom may not want to do that, but he needs to."
Tom is very happy that his team won.
He never saw his brother again.
Is it made of iron?
Try to rest.
Don't ever forget this rule.
We're not fools.
Tom started to scream.
Give me your car keys.
I have made a resolution to keep a diary this year.
I'm from the West Coast.
You'd better do that right now.
Tom teaches me French twice a week.
Love blinded him to her faults.
I'm not sure if it's a boy or a girl.
I'll be here if you want me.
I wanted to be your friend.
Tom will speak.
I was feeling nostalgic.
I'm not sure where Tom is.
There's no way to get off the island.
I took it for granted that you would come with us.
I think you know we need to do that.
Remember to lock the door.
You look troubled.
I knew what was going on.
I don't think that Tom will want to do that.
When did you return?
Did you know Tom almost married Mary?
That could be fun.
Tom wanted to get married to Mary.
I don't think Tom is in love.
Tom is looking for his umbrella.
Did they say why?
I didn't think you'd catch any fish.
I thought you'd already left.
She thinks that she's always right.
Tom went fly fishing with his father.
Tom accepted the compromise.
It makes no difference to me whether you go or not.
I thought you'd seen this movie.
Many people were killed in the plane accident.
I don't claim that we're perfect.
Is my answer correct?
What time do you leave home in the morning?
"She fell ill, but got well soon."
The shop is closed on Sunday.
My radio is broken.
Let's get acquainted.
Please tell me where the bus stop is.
You caught me off guard.
I didn't do it on purpose.
She isn't answering her phone.
This is the boy who helped me.
I've forgotten the words to that song.
I think Tom is witty.
The baby woke up in the middle of the night.
They are very popular among boys.
I'll be ready next time.
I haven't seen it.
We live in a complicated world.
Everybody likes french fries.
Tom trusted Mary more than anyone else.
Tom likes the way Mary makes potato salad.
Don't tell Tom what I've just told you.
Where did you go for your honeymoon?
Don't forget your ticket.
He apologized to the teacher for coming to school late.
Tom said that he knew Mary would do that.
That isn't important to me.
How much cheese did you buy?
How long does it take from here to your house on foot?
Pandas are cute.
Both of them have been arrested.
It will be cloudy.
Honey is sweet.
They need to work tomorrow.
I never said that.
Something bad may happen.
Do you have a pen?
I went to the zoo with my sister.
I'm not good at singing.
"Well, you were right."
We were up all night.
Be careful not to offend Tom.
Tom took out his earplugs.
He must be from the South.
Beijing is bigger than Rome.
I expect you to tell me the truth.
"Thanks to your help, I could succeed."
He doesn't have to wash the car.
He practiced every day at home.
I thought it was obvious.
The sky brightened.
I know that Tom is afraid of me.
How exactly did that happen?
The typhoon moved in a westerly direction.
Tom is learning JavaScript.
You don't understand how worried I was about you.
I'll leave immediately.
I've kept my promise.
I got a message from Tom in French.
I'll tell you what's happened.
See you next week.
"As I told you before, Tom can't be trusted."
Do you remember your passport number?
Why did you agree to do that?
He's a slowpoke.
Tom got exhausted.
Why didn't anyone say that?
"I just want to be your friend, nothing more."
Have you tried Japanese beer?
This song is stupid.
Don't beat your head against a stone wall.
Tom wore a pirate costume.
That's not the way it happened.
It depends on many things.
He met an unexpected obstacle.
Would Tom want to sing?
Are you talking about this?
I speak to Tom quite often.
He passed the test as was expected.
Do you like this kind of music?
I've lived in Boston for three years.
She's not as beautiful as her mother.
Why do you always wear that hat?
"If you wish, you can go."
I sat behind a very tall person at the theater.
Are you sure it was me?
Thanks for giving me this.
Tom asked Mary if she could make him a sandwich.
I've started to read the book.
I don't want to shoot you.
How do you know that?
Tom got wounded.
Who's the lucky one?
I forgot the words to that song.
Did Tom say how long he'd be away?
I don't think that this is the end.
Have you talked to the doctors yet?
There are only books on the bookshelf.
You're not yourself today.
There's snow on the ground.
She blames me for the fact that our married life isn't going well.
Why do you not like your job?
Tom stood and put on his coat.
I'm not as good at speaking French as Tom is.
Prices have soared.
He went out without saying goodbye to me.
I spilled coffee on your tablecloth.
She spilled her drink all over my dress.
They were here.
Tom has already done that lots of times.
This is our land.
Tom said that he'd be going by train.
I'm Tom's supervisor.
Is that mine?
We're only here to help Tom.
I envy you.
Please tell Tom Mary called.
I can see it in your eyes.
The pickpocket disappeared into the crowd.
It took me several hours to repair it.
She wrapped her arms around his neck.
I always carry a bottle of mineral water with me.
Who told you about me?
We still need to buy some bread.
Tom said he'd win.
Didn't you know I didn't need to do that?
Tom said he wouldn't buy any of Mary's paintings.
Why don't people hibernate?
We ate together.
Have you ever argued with your parents?
Tom asked me if I was tired.
Some people are afraid of spiders.
Not everybody knows about my plan.
I bought a newspaper.
I don't believe what Tom just said.
I called Tom and got his answering machine.
Does that work?
Didn't you know I wanted to do that?
Tom wasn't even scared.
Tom is going to kiss Mary.
I'm not sure that we can trust Tom.
Tom is past thirty.
I've already told you what to do.
It may rain around noon.
He is skilled in handicraft.
You're my girl now.
Japan is full of surprises!
I kept screaming.
I've tried to be reasonable.
I liked it a lot.
Why doesn't Tom agree with you?
Tom was in no hurry to get married.
Tom is resilient.
I told Tom not to shout.
Tom is going to help you.
I was very pleased.
I retired three years ago.
Tom doesn't know where to wait for Mary.
What was it that brought you to me?
How are the eggs?
Tom may have feelings for Mary.
I missed seeing that movie. Did you see it?
Tomorrow is the big day.
These are the lowest prices I've ever seen.
Last Saturday I bought a laptop.
Tom suppressed a yawn.
He found me a good seat.
Maybe we should buy a new one.
There's no elevator.
"Actually, you're right."
Aren't you afraid to die?
What do you plan to buy Tom for Christmas?
I want to tell you.
Tom was trying not to panic.
What do I need this for?
Tom's comments are always to the point.
Tom didn't have enough time to finish his homework.
Pork has a lot of fat.
"Is there a problem, Tom?"
Do you want to see my boat?
You did an excellent job.
Never put off until tomorrow what you can do the day after tomorrow.
There wasn't a single shred of evidence.
She dived into the swimming pool.
We're gardeners.
Tom recognized the sound.
She invited me to the ballet.
What are your weekend plans?
Tom did that at school.
"I recognize him, but I don't remember his name."
We didn't hear you come in.
You're a bit strange.
Tom didn't recognize the person sitting next to him.
I know that Tom is asleep.
You can't marry Tom.
I came to talk to you about Tom.
I need a kitchen knife.
Leather shoes are a lot more expensive.
Tom said that you like popcorn.
You're going to be jealous.
I'm a housewife.
Turn it down.
You've already told me that.
Why did you leave?
She helped her mother clean the house.
I can't stand the sight of blood.
Does Tom like Boston?
I get your point.
I'll probably come by taxi.
Stop bothering me!
You're not fired.
Tom couldn't go with Mary.
We haven't spoken in three years.
"Which do you like better, apples or bananas?"
"If you're happy, I'm happy."
Give me a call when you get back.
Have you ever seen a shark over three meters long?
Why do we have to go anywhere?
That was a lie.
What a great discovery!
They can't both be right.
Tom seems different today.
Tom waited for a while.
He broke the rules.
Would you mind if I helped?
I would act differently in your place.
I'm too busy.
I didn't see you come in.
I don't often do this.
He had the nerve to say that.
I need pain medication.
You got distracted.
Please fetch me a piece of paper.
"What kind of music do you want to hear? ""Put on something romantic."""
I'd like to ask a favor of you.
His mother looks young for her age.
I'll rip your head off!
Let's try.
"You can't afford to buy that, can you?"
Tom is the only one who thanked me.
My friends and I want to throw you a goodbye party.
I plan to visit Tom in Boston next weekend.
I was talking about something else.
Please come inside.
Every detail matters.
I shot the horse.
I thought you liked swimming.
I think you're right.
Tom said he had to wait for Mary.
She was playing the piano at that time.
Tom is emotional.
Tom told me a good joke this morning.
"You weren't scared, were you?"
He said it as a joke.
We're not going to sell it.
I didn't need Tom's permission to do that.
Life is too short.
He is happiest when he is with his grandchildren.
She stayed there for a short while.
I don't want you following me.
Did you eat lunch?
Correct the following sentences.
Are you going there on business?
Why didn't I think of it myself?
How did you all escape?
Tom wants to move to Boston.
Who got the highest score?
Tom hasn't called the police yet.
Tom teaches at this school.
Does your head still hurt?
Tom knows he's been lied to.
I've been waiting for you a long time.
I couldn't believe that was happening.
I have three friends named Tom.
"That's not very far, is it?"
Tom got wounded in the battle.
Is it raining?
Tom didn't have anyone to help him.
Her voice sounds better than yours.
We were forced to work hard.
You're in trouble.
Tom has lived in Boston his entire life.
They play basketball.
Tom can't find what he's looking for.
Nothing's missing.
I can't leave you here.
I was shocked to see how thin Tom had gotten.
I told a joke.
Tom said that he'd try to convince Mary to do that.
Tell me what your father does.
Didn't you know Tom had a son?
"You're not going to shoot me, are you?"
Didn't you know that Tom didn't want to do that?
He went to Hawaii to do some sightseeing.
I wonder whether Tom is OK.
You had better not make a noise here.
Did you have a favorite book as a child?
I thought you looked sad.
I love Tom's eyes.
Tom was there this morning.
You can't fool me this time.
Tom provided no further details.
That's hard to believe.
Tom told me I could call you.
The bus turned around the corner.
Tom told Mary he'd be busy on Monday.
Wake up.
"By the age of 25, she had lived in five different countries."
Tom and Mary won't visit Boston.
I can't eat.
Tom talked about his school.
I don't think that Tom can do that without our help.
Tom was snoring loudly while he slept.
I love the way you kiss me.
I have what you want.
Let's look at the facts.
Have you written down the phone number?
I could hear everybody cheering.
Tom isn't cheating.
Have you seen this video?
"To make matters worse, it began to snow."
No one's allowed in.
I sometimes hear my father singing in the bathroom.
He's a very hard worker.
Tom started climbing.
"Could you wrap this separately, please?"
You won't believe your eyes.
You can have half of this.
The air conditioner makes too much noise.
I didn't know Tom was going to do that.
How's it going at school?
"As you make your bed, so you must lie in it."
The spark plugs aren't the problem.
He doesn't want to wait for you.
Maybe Tom has already done that.
Tom has no one to turn to for help.
Tom didn't know that he had a secret admirer.
Please don't tell Tom about what happened.
I didn't realize what I was doing.
I have been married for ten years.
I can't think of anything else.
We eat at home.
I didn't want Tom to leave.
I untied the ribbon.
I can't forgive Tom.
Mars has a very thin atmosphere.
The train was delayed for two hours because of the heavy snow.
I can't believe I finally managed to do it.
I am yours and you are mine.
I completely forgot about Tom.
Why would I be upset?
I have what I want.
"If you heat ice, it melts."
Tom only sang three songs.
I didn't tell Tom anything about this.
Tom isn't looking well.
I was just about to say that.
Tom is very proud of you.
Tom is peeling the potatoes.
I don't study French.
Why are you waiting?
Didn't you know Tom passed away three years ago?
I hope we win.
You're in shock.
Do you like this song?
He's busy and can't meet with you.
I'm honored to work with Tom.
She was late for the bus.
She may have been surprised when she received my letter.
Guess what happened.
I'm going to ask him for an autograph. Do you have anything to write with?
Tom paused a second.
Did you say everything that you wanted to say?
Money cannot buy happiness.
You're young and healthy.
Tom is able to play soccer.
I don't think that that was your fault.
Each speaker was allotted five minutes.
Tom slept in this morning.
The negotiations have begun.
We'll have a French test next Monday.
Tom wasn't able to change anything.
You're a good athlete.
Don't confuse desire with love.
She asked him to sit down.
You're unforgettable.
Forgive me if I have offended you.
Tom works eight hours a day.
I don't make mistakes.
You're the only friend I have.
It's obvious Tom doesn't know anything.
Tom is going to thank me.
I'll try to do it as fast as I can.
Tom flexed his muscles in front of the mirror.
Tom must've missed the train.
Do your homework right now.
Let's get together and talk it over.
How high is Mont Blanc?
I like you.
Tom told me he wasn't coming.
Tom's statement is pure nonsense.
Why can't I do that?
I haven't been in Australia since October.
Could I ask you a few questions about Tom?
Shall I close the window?
You were talking in your sleep last night.
I have to be up by 6:30.
Is that coffee I smell?
Tom is always with Mary.
I seldom drink coffee in the evening.
Raise your hands!
Some of them have committed suicide.
How many people are here?
Take that one.
Don't you realize your behavior reflects on all of us?
He broke his promise.
You can tell me.
I think Tom is already on the plane.
When is it going to happen?
Can't you wait until tomorrow?
She was out of Japan last year.
I know what they mean.
Were you listening to me?
Somebody is following us.
Why do you close your eyes when you kiss me?
This is my answer to your question.
I'll never ask you this question again.
Education does not consist simply in learning a lot of facts.
"May I have the check, please?"
When did you start learning French?
You must talk to Tom.
Tom and Mary are absent today.
He's a good liar.
You've made your choice.
Do you want me to try talking to Tom?
What kind of places would you like to see?
This time I'm going with you.
Tom didn't understand what was going on.
Tom didn't understand my French.
Tom didn't know what he needed to do.
I found his office easily.
At present he lives by himself and the rest of the world means nothing to him.
It's going to be easy.
I have a white cat.
I have a good many things to do today.
"At five o'clock, there's always a rush."
I want you to eat something.
He will do anything to make money.
"Whether you like it or not, you'll have to do it."
Tell me about your fight with Tom.
I'm very lucky.
The seat of my pants is torn.
I know you don't care what happens.
I can teach you how to cook.
How long will you be here?
Tom said that he wouldn't help us anymore.
We couldn't hide our tracks.
Tom doesn't want to be an engineer.
I completely agree with you.
I'm sure you deserved it.
Don't make me do that.
He looked back at us many times and walked away.
Your team is better than ours.
Don't you ever speak to me like that again.
I told Tom I'm from Boston.
Do you often visit your grandparents?
It sounds like you've been talking to Tom.
I hate the way the water tastes here.
It rained a lot that winter.
I ran into an old friend.
The window is closed.
What is your opinion on this matter?
I couldn't help myself.
Thank you for helping me cross the road.
The movie is about to start.
I didn't know that Tom wanted to do that.
Tom found the keys he thought he had lost.
Do you really like to do that?
I've explained the situation to Tom.
Movie theaters are losing more and more revenue due to internet piracy.
I didn't do much.
Can you do that for Tom?
Was Tom the one who told you where to park?
I'm not really busy.
I'm going to give you a bike for your birthday.
I know Tom is in there.
When will you return my book to me?
Tom wasn't with me.
I want to know about your country.
Who'll get there the quickest?
I'm afraid you're right.
Please give the baby a bath.
Tom leaned back in his chair.
I hope you're satisfied.
They won't come.
Is Tom still studying French?
I don't want you doing that.
You've got some paint on your nose.
It's in the kitchen.
Tom had no choice but to stay.
Tom thought I'd let him down.
Why haven't you done that yet?
Do you really think Tom can do that without any help?
I think that you're to blame.
He is eight.
Who told you all that?
Tom couldn't do even one push-up when he started training.
Tom fell into a deep sleep.
We don't have much time. Let's hurry.
Go over to Tom's.
All the girls in Tom's class think he's handsome.
Tom doesn't know how to ride a bike.
I hope you are hungry.
They've fooled you.
Do you have a computer at home?
I almost never go to Boston anymore.
I feel like dancing.
Why were you laughing?
Your opinion matters.
"You're drunk, aren't you?"
Tom frowned slightly.
I thought this book was interesting.
Don't waste your time doing that.
I'd like to buy something to eat.
The plumber used many tools to fix our sink.
Would you like to know how to prevent getting wrinkles?
Did Tom tell you where he was going?
It has been raining heavily for three hours.
Thank you for everything.
Are you going on foot or by bus?
I did smoke when I was young.
We'll come by tonight.
He introduced me to her at the party.
Tom lives in a very big mansion.
That doesn't matter.
Come here at exactly six o'clock.
"You remember what happened that last time, don't you?"
I think you should get more rest.
There was no reason to panic.
I thought you knew that.
It suddenly started raining.
Let's find out why.
Children generally have a higher body temperature than adults.
Where did you meet my father?
Let's try to find some shade.
I asked Tom to open the window.
You're the only one who knows how to do this.
We know what you want.
I think that Tom will be happy with the results.
I don't want to seem insensitive.
Write that down.
I would never have guessed that.
I bought them for you.
"Tom never admits that he's wrong, because he thinks that's a sign of weakness."
You're diplomatic.
They left nothing for me.
She ordered a cup of tea.
I don't think that it's Tom.
I don't think that anybody noticed what I was doing.
It just scares me.
Do you like my motorcycle?
I have to go home early today.
I want to be able to speak French.
I'll risk that.
Why haven't you asked for my help?
Which one is better?
It's one of the basic human instincts.
Why do we have to go anywhere?
I think that Tom will win the race.
Tom is interested in horses.
You're qualified.
I'm going to go talk to Tom.
I guess this wasn't easy for you.
"We have your size, but not in that color."
Tom isn't watching.
I'm not looking for a relationship.
I hate sand.
I'm the strongest.
Tom is going to agree.
I didn't know what I should say to Tom.
I'm sorry I couldn't do that.
What time is the concert?
You've won.
Tom borrowed three books from Mary.
He hesitated for a while.
I'm sure Tom was here yesterday.
I've been living in Boston for almost three years.
I feel lost without you.
You need to listen to Tom.
Are you relaxed?
Tom almost got caught.
I've been waiting for Tom since 2:30.
Brush your hair.
What is the longest river in the world?
Things have been pretty rough lately for Tom.
"I'm going to sleep, because I'm getting tired."
Tom buttoned his shirt.
Tom never got his money back.
I'll try to never be late again.
Sorry for your loss.
Tom will be thirteen next month.
What can you tell me about this?
We didn't have enough time.
Tom is going to wait.
I always think about that.
Tom was incredibly lucky.
Where did Tom get this tennis racket?
She doesn't want me to speak about this issue.
It's not unusual for Tom to be late.
I missed the train by two minutes.
Isn't that true?
We don't need this at all.
I know you've got more important things to do.
Tom dimmed the lights.
I wonder why I have to do that.
Let's go sledding.
She made a quick adjustment to her new job.
You should've apologized to Tom for calling him names.
He left his hometown on a cold morning.
Tom said that he wanted to be alone and then he went upstairs to his bedroom.
Tom started singing along.
Tom and I want you to come with us.
Tom knew he had no choice.
Tom's dog bit my leg.
It looks like rain.
How do you know how heavy it is?
We didn't choose Tom.
I don't want to turn on the news.
I don't have as much patience as you do.
I don't think there is any way I can help.
I really don't think that you'd understand.
How are you going to prove that?
What happened was my fault.
Put it back where it was.
Do it somewhere else.
I've finished reading that book.
I like Tom a lot.
Tom taught Mary how to write songs.
Tom didn't recognize anyone in the photo.
Those women are strong.
Tom is old enough to make his own decisions.
"I want beef, too."
Speak clearly.
I never thought it would happen to me.
Tom says he hopes to change that soon.
She has no enemies.
Tom only drinks decaffeinated coffee.
It seems we have quite a few problems.
Tom said he wasn't going anywhere today.
It was a hard exam.
We don't even know where we are.
Tom is an experienced sailor.
I should've told you the truth.
I'm used to waiting.
I have a student visa.
Is anybody I know going to be there?
You shouldn't lend Tom any money.
Can you give that chair to her?
You swore that you loved me.
I still have your key.
Cover your eyes.
We're aware of the problem.
Are you sure this is a coincidence?
Tom and Mary seem to love each other.
I begged her not to go there.
Tom has always been a health nut.
Will you buy it?
Tom hasn't found a good job yet.
This happened before.
Don't believe the media.
May I suggest another hotel?
None of these T-shirts are mine.
Why does it matter?
Tom taught me some French.
The doctor took my pulse.
It is not going to rain this evening.
Can I borrow this?
Have a safe flight.
"It's not that I don't want to go, it's just that it's not a good time for me."
Let me know if you need my help.
Do you want to be famous?
I thought they were unemployed.
He helped me to get over the difficulties.
I agree with everything you said.
Time is of the essence.
Who wants apple pie?
Gold is far heavier than water.
You don't need me.
I handed the mike to Tom.
We won't know whether we can do it or not unless we try.
Tom is a little nuts.
Tom said that Mary was sick.
Tom and I are leaving.
You should see a doctor.
I'd do anything for you.
I told Tom not to scream.
You could die.
Tom washes his face every morning before breakfast.
Didn't you know that Tom was Canadian?
Stay with Tom.
We thought you could do that.
Aren't you afraid of anything?
What're you doing here?
We just wanted you to know.
Tom doesn't know much about his neighbors.
This is also important.
Go see for yourself.
He drove in a nail with his hammer.
"Tom is telling the truth, isn't he?"
Their swords clashed.
Tell me what I should've done.
You didn't understand me.
Look at the setting sun.
I didn't go into details.
She spent most of her life taking care of poor people.
Tom thinks he can win.
My doctor told me to give up smoking.
You probably already know about our company.
Tom's hands were cold.
I know Tom is innocent.
Tom said he's skeptical.
What can I do to help you?
Is Tom a hero or traitor?
I want to know why you aren't ready.
Do you know anything about Tom?
I don't really have a boyfriend.
He often travels to foreign countries.
I don't need to go anywhere today.
I wish I had a better memory.
Do you have bread for lunch?
Tom hired himself an assistant.
Tom's wife is pregnant with their second child.
Nobody's sitting here.
That doesn't solve the problem.
Tom asked me for my opinion.
I've already been there.
He's been looking for the missing cat all day.
I don't want to spend my whole life here.
No one owes me anything.
Someone asked me to give this to you.
Are you willing to help me clean the garage?

I know you're lying.
I have a lot of work to do.
Please put your thumbprint here.
I would appreciate it if you could agree to my plan.
The kitchen is clean.

I wasn't the one driving the car.
And what exactly were you doing?

Tom has something to tell you.
Don't make me say it.
She put the book in the bag.
I don't think Tom is lonely.
I'm not yet a millionaire.
Tom loved to sing.
This is for you.
Don't tell me if you don't want to.
How do you know which one is yours?
Tom said he didn't want me to tell Mary what had happened.
"Tell it to him, not me!"
She's a good kisser.
Isn't that your dictionary?
Tom gave Mary a driving lesson.

Do you have a fever?
I know that we can do that if we try.

Tom told everyone about what had happened.
Are you telling me you don't know where Tom lives?
There is no use in asking him for assistance.
We've got no plans to do that.
Where did you go today?
I need this more than you.
I misspelled the word.
Correcting is sometimes harder than writing.
Why is Tom upset?
I've just been to the bank.
We have been friends.
I am taking a couple of days off.
I know almost nothing about you.
I have to obey his orders.
I didn't know Tom spoke French so fluently.

That would be funny.

It's an ambitious project.
Tom worried about Mary.
Everyone is upset.
Tom cooked me dinner.
What I want to know is why.
I don't know whose bicycle this is.

Why don't I do that?
Come on over here.
You can go home.
Tom speaks French better than you do.

He has a small advantage.
Let Tom rest.
Tom will do the same.
They were found dead.
Guess who else moved to Boston.
You don't have to worry. I'll do it myself.
Tom can't catch a break.
We'll never know.
Tom instantly recognized Mary.
Is that for sale?
Do you think Tom is in Boston?

Do you mind their coming too?
Who else do you plan to invite?
We're not going to sell it.
I know that something horrible will happen.

I went to the movies with my brother.
Tom is going to eat with us.

Do you want to talk now?
It was all just a big misunderstanding.

You know Tom was right.
I don't understand why I needed to do that.
"You're divorced, aren't you?"
Why didn't I die?
"Fill it up, please."
I'm not doing anything right now.
Tom showed Mary the letter that he got from John.
I can never tell when you're kidding.

You're so talented.
He seems to have left the country.
"I'm very busy now, so I can't do that."
I wish I'd listened to you.
What's Tom done?
I like blue.
I urge everyone to do the same.
I agreed to buy it.
The shop on the corner sells fruit at a very good price.
"On weekends, I take my dogs out for a long walk in the park."

It's about to rain.
Tom expects Mary back by 2:30.
He was picked up by a passing ship.
You should calm down.
Tom often sings with his friends.
I didn't know that Tom needed to do that.
She spends a lot of money when she goes abroad.
The situation is serious.
Here's a list of things I want you to do for me.

We must remain here.
Tom and John are normal teenage boys.
I need proof.
Is there anything else you would like to eat?
I'd better go look for Tom.
That song's bound to be a hit.
Tom knew why Mary didn't like him.
The train was almost empty.
Just give it a little time.
They want us to do it.
That's just an excuse.
I know when your birthday is.
I didn't know you were drunk.
Tell her you like her. Don't be afraid. She won't bite you.
Would all the mothers please wait here?
Please don't hurry.
What's your cat's name?
Try to be home before dark.
I don't want to know where you were.
Now my daughter is afraid of me.
Tom told me this was just temporary.
Did you manage to get something to eat?
I kept silent.
Tom never said he wanted to go with us.
You can easily get there by bus.
Tom asked me to talk to Mary.
Stop borrowing my clothes without my permission.
He will wait.
I was a science teacher.
What're you saying?
Tom can play the piano.
Tom was running around the streets drunk and naked.
He doesn't know anything about Germany.
You'll never stop me.
This sparrow's wings are broken.
Who gave you this?
Let's learn French.
I changed the arrangement of the furniture in my room.
Tom was alone on an empty beach.
It'll be cold this evening.
I'm first.
You're a soldier now.
"Speak to me, Tom."
I have it.
What do you think of his suggestion?
I still want to speak French.
Someone came.
I've upset you.
I think that Tom may be right this time.
What were you doing when I called you yesterday?
Both Tom and Mary are dying.
The fire started in the bathhouse.
What was it that Tom bought yesterday?
Take a bus.
Did you see it?
It isn't snowing.
I didn't know you had allergies.
I couldn't bear to lose you again.
Fire is dangerous.
She advised him to go to the police station.
I am so exhausted!
He's shorter than his father.
Did you feel that?
Have a good time on your date.
I paid about 50 dollars.
Could you explain it more simply?
Tom and I looked at each other.
Do you think you're modest?
I don't really get the point.
Listen to yourself.
It could've been much worse.
We're going to miss you a lot.
We all love Australia.
"If I were you, I'd start immediately."
Did you drop it?
Tom's wicked.
I'm sure that you'll be satisfied.
We missed you.
Whose is all this money?
We do what we want.
We need to finish this.
I think I'll stay in Boston for another week.
This song reminds me of someone I used to know.
She participated in the beauty contest.
There are too many of us to fit into one taxi.
Did Caesar have a dog?
He didn't help his father.
When did you finish it?
Tom isn't Mary's friend.
You're not yourself.
How can we thank you?
Somebody wanted to scare you.
Keep on trying.
Do you still think you'll be able to do that?
I'm not worried about money.
Tom is the one who broke the window yesterday.
Tell me how Tom and Mary met.
Find out how Tom plans to spend his weekend.
We've done it many times before.
Tom bent down and touched his toes.
Tom has never worked a day in his life.
I've had my ups and downs.
I want to go to Australia someday.
I was in a hurry.
You're too slow.
"We want to have fun, too."
"If Tom goes, I will, too."
"You blew it, Tom."
I lay in bed thinking about everything that had happened that day.
My birthday falls on a Sunday this year.
This book was printed in England.
Why is Tom so unlucky?
He was looking for this very thing.
Tom doesn't want to be touched by anyone.
We have bananas.
Tom taught himself how to ski.
Can I stay a little longer?
Where did you buy this ball?
Tom put on his tie.
You shouldn't impose your opinion on others.
I love both of you.
"You are a schoolteacher, aren't you?"
You two may leave.
Don't miss your chance to do that.
I can't find it.
He abandoned his family and went to live in Tahiti.
"She always looked happy, but never was."
I spent a year in Boston.
"Tom is quite cynical, isn't he?"
Tom is definitely up to something.
I'm wet.
I don't know whether you are telling the truth or not.
I slept on the bus.
It's the voice of an old woman.
You were late this morning.
This scandal will likely ruin your chances of being elected.
You were with me on that night.
Do you think Tom is insane?
I'll call you back in an hour.
I haven't seen Tom in weeks.
Many international conferences have been held in Geneva.
There's something I want to check.
There's a garden behind our house.
Nobody smiled.
I didn't know you were going to come.
I thought you were different.
Tom doesn't agree.
I framed Tom.
I resemble my mother.
His words touched her heart.
Tom asked Mary if she knew how to play that song on the flute.
Don't expect anyone to help you.
I have nothing to do.
I've got nothing against you.
I wanted to go.
Tom often goes there.
Is it true that Tom committed suicide?
Tom and I weren't laughing.
That's exactly what I mean.
I'd like to go to Australia.
We'll try to make a good impression.
I wanted to say I was sorry.
I thought that you might need it.
Tom told Mary that he wouldn't do it.
That man is on trial for the murder of a little girl.
I've agreed to teach Tom French.
I'm sure Tom will like it.
Tom went to visit his sister in Boston.
He is crazy.
She asked him out on a date.
Tom wants our report before lunch.
I hate it when my clothes smell of cigarette smoke.
I sometimes do that in the morning.
A stranger approached him.
Tom is here to help.
Are you questioning my loyalty?
Tom hasn't talked to Mary about that yet.
I think you owe me some money.
It might rain tomorrow.
Didn't your parents teach you manners?
We're celebrating Tom's birthday.
He has few friends.
Making money is his religion.
Stay with Tom.
What did the boy say?
You're going to regret this.
Tom was just doing his duty.
Tom had a little accident.
I can see the ocean from here.
"I'm coming home, Tom."
We hope to reach the summit before it gets dark.
Tom says that he'll be at the meeting tomorrow.
Tom closed his eyes and took a deep breath.
I share a room with Tom.
Tom was waiting for Mary.
I can't follow Tom's logic.
Brazil is a huge country.
Does anyone have a map?
How many of your students are here?
Didn't you know that Tom was going to Australia with Mary?
We're going to the theater.
Could I borrow your phone?
It used to be better.
They captured Rome in June of 1944.
I don't think we can trust Tom.
I don't always approve of his methods.
Tom is now married.
Finding Tom won't be difficult.
You'll be alone.
Tom sold the necklace to Mary for a very low price.
This is my fiancé.
Three people were arrested.
"Come with me, Tom."
Tom is engaged to Mary.
You must know that I snore.
I don't want to watch TV.
Do you know what this is about?
I didn't mean to wake you up.
"Do you mind if I use your phone? ""No, please go ahead."""
Why can't I go with you?
I've never been so proud of Tom.
I spoke to my parents.
Have you ever been drunk?
I haven't finished all my homework yet.
I consider it my duty.
Where's Tom's assistant?
Is it near here?
Where's your significant other?
I'm only going to tell you this once.
You should be more careful the next time.
Is Tom good?
"Yesterday, I ran into my teacher at the amusement park."
Tom is at home now.
Give me three hours.
"Tomorrow, I'm going to study at the library."
Tom never finishes anything.
Tom thought this was funny.
Tom has nothing to hide.
Tom is three years older than his wife.
The ladies' room is on the third floor.
I'm thinking of going to Australia to visit Tom.
She accused me of telling a lie.
I'm older than you think.
I don't know how long it takes to get to Boston from here.
He has enough willpower.
Do you know how to whistle?
Both Tom and I speak French.
Didn't Tom want to talk to us?
This pillow is very uncomfortable.
"Mary is cute, but she's not very smart."
The police want to question you.
We will contact you as soon as we know.
I think the same way as you do.
Do you really think that Tom had nothing to do with what happened?
I'm a teacher.
I was deeply affected by his speech.
You didn't even tell me that Tom had died.
Tom is suffering from a nervous disorder.
I left home at seven.
Tom doesn't come here anymore.
I don't think I'll go to Tom's party.
I had no idea you didn't know how to speak French.
Hurry up or you'll be late.
I tried to help you.
I guess Tom changed his mind.
Both Tom and I are blind.
Why did you get so angry?
What is the truth?
Tom asked his father to help him make a snowman.
My decision is final.
Tom turned on the lamp.
I didn't want to mislead anyone.
Aren't you two dating each other?
Three people were rescued.
The skyscraper is in the center of the city.
We're all worn out.
"Take it easy, Tom."
I want a knife.
Mary told Tom that she was moving to Boston.
Tom said he'd found something.
They'll be afraid.
Tom hasn't been executed yet.
I need you to help me with this.
What do you want to listen to?
All you ever think about is work.
No one could believe it.
Tom mowed the lawn.
I forgot to tell Tom I wouldn't be there.
We've all done things we're ashamed of.
Turn to channel 1.
Tom has been avoiding Mary.
I hope we can avoid these mistakes in the future.
I have breakfast at seven every morning.
Tom isn't afraid of anything.
I looked at the sky.
Do you want to see something?
You got here too early.
Whatever can go wrong will go wrong.
I was just nervous.
We'll leave as soon as it quits raining.
Tom asked me if I could give him a job.
I saw you at the flower shop.
Tom knows he shouldn't have said that.
Give me the backpack.
Tom knows how to speak to children.
The officer inspired his men to be brave.
I check my mailbox almost every day.
You'd better shut up.
I don't dance.
I wasn't surprised when Tom told me about what had happened.
I'm afraid we can't stay here.
Why do people do such stupid things?
Let me guess.
This movie isn't interesting.
Don't worry. I'll be careful.
We'll leave tomorrow morning.
What happened to Tom this morning?
I knew Tom would be shocked.
I'll do what you ask.
I think we have a problem here.
It was quite funny.
We'll be there by 2:30.
Guess what I've got for you.
When did you come in?
Tom is fashionable.
Did you have a good time?
Somebody has been following me.
I won't miss you.
Your hair is beautiful.
Tom walks his dog every morning.
The tetanus shot hurt more than the dog bite.
I'm tired of waiting for things to happen.
Take three steps and jump.
Can you recommend anything?
I saw Tom's face.
Let's talk about your childhood.
Are you still afraid of the dark?
I am a very good chess player.
You're one of us now.
Do you think Tom is hungry?
Did Tom tell you to say that?
Will you be there?
I fed the leftovers to my dog.
Tom asked me where I lived.
This isn't news to anyone.
We have complete confidence in Tom.
I'm beginning to think there's nothing we can do to help Tom.
I want you to wait here.
Tell me more about yourselves.
Tom is on the official list.
I don't think we should stay here.
We've been close friends for many years.
Are you eating right?
I know what you need.
How many of the words on this list do you not know?
"It's very cold today, isn't it?"
Are you and Tom friends?
My father left me a large fortune.
We just want to play chess.
I can start anytime.
I want you to teach Tom how to drive.
You can use the dictionary.
Where is the bus?
You work too hard these days. Aren't you tired?
"In situations like these, a gun might come in handy."
I'm thinking about going back into teaching.
We had a rough time.
It's a difficult matter.
How is your sister?
Tom can handle French quite well.
That can be arranged.
That's a book.
Haven't I told you this before?
Tom took off his glasses and rubbed his forehead.
I'm hungry. How about you?
Let's never sing that song again.
Tom said he wanted to win.
I wanted to ask Tom how long he had lived in India.
Don't ask me how it works.
Tom has various bank accounts.
"She is not my sister, she's my wife."
I knew I should've gone with you.
This will never change.
We came to apologize.
I'll tell him that.
Let's meet the day after tomorrow.
Tom said that he felt tired.
Stop beating around the bush.
I bet Tom won't come.
Why aren't you answering?
When did you start dating?
My house burned down.
What's the file extension?
That would be wonderful.
I don't like him coming to my house so often.
Tell Tom I'm sick.
You can't help Tom tomorrow because you have to work all day.
I was unconscious.
Tom is about the same age as I am.
I think Tom will be furious.
She said something to him.
Tom put his new sneakers in his bag.
Is roast chicken on the menu tonight?
Tom vanished into the darkness.
What language are they speaking?
I don't care if Tom comes or not.
I think he ate about 10 oysters.
You have what they want.
I am thinking of going to the mountains.
She bought her son a camera.
There were no more apples in the box.
He's never been in love before.
I hope I get a watch for my birthday.
Do you have French newspapers?
Have something to drink.
Tom put me up for a night.
I had hardly started to work when it began to rain.
You should begin right away.
I'd never thought about that.
It was a forced smile.
I saw Tom kiss you.
Did Tom seem busy?
"You're one of them, aren't you?"
Don't tell me what to eat.
Tom will be glad to see you.
How is Tom doing now?
How has the Internet changed your job?
I'd advise you to mind your own business.
I want to hear it from Tom.
I know you'll do what needs to be done.
What makes you think that I don't want to go?
You've gotten fat.
I don't particularly like her.
Tom's father's name is John.
I'll do that tomorrow for sure.
Please give me a spool of white thread.
I'd like to see the principal.
We ordered some new books from abroad.
Do something else.
What have they done today?
Tom found his glasses and put them on.
I'm related to Tom.
All of us are Canadians.
I'll agree to your terms.
I know that Tom is fat.
You can't live on that island.
I'd like to find out how this got broken.
The bomb missed its target.
We've been asked to not do this anymore.
Is that a dog?
What's the matter?
His story is true.
The cat likes to sleep beside me.
It's too fast.
There is a library in every city in America.
I didn't know that I'd hurt anyone.
I can dress myself.
They are taking a walk.
You'd better go get dressed.
I think Tom will tell you the truth.
The sink is full of dirty dishes.
"I'm sorry, I don't think I'll be able to."
You're the person I've been looking for.
I'm glad you made it home safely.
It's not too late to call Tom now.
The doctor thinks Tom's problem is psychological.
I want you to tell me what to do.
It's possible that Tom isn't telling the truth.
We used to visit each other on the weekend.
We've had rain for almost a week.
Tom fooled us all.
"Tom is afraid, I think."
We're going to crash.
Have a look at that picture.
Is that allowed?
Tom punched Mary in the stomach.
Why are you sweating?
Have you found what you were looking for?
She can't do that.
Let me speak.
Mary is an ambitious girl.
You'll have to leave.
I thought Tom could speak French.
Tom doesn't want to live with me.
Tom is too young to get a driver's license.
I might be back before you leave.
"Shortly after the accident, the police came."
Tom doesn't agree with you.
Where did Tom get this tennis racket?
I feel better today than yesterday.
I'll allow this.
Don't try to do that.
Tom finished the job in three hours.
We now know that isn't true.
Tom made Mary a birthday cake.
Capri is one the most beautiful islands of Italy.
My phone's ringing.
Tom found the person he was looking for.
How's the weather in Boston?
I want to go to Tokyo.
Mary is really great. She cooked a wonderful meal for me and even washed the dishes herself.
Tom doesn't know me at all.
That's the house they were living in.
You are now on the way to recovery.
I wish Tom had come with me.
No one disagreed.
I'm prettier than Mary.
Tom stayed in Boston a few days.
Do you know what love is?
I know that you can't play the guitar.
I'll see what else needs to be done.
I don't know why I hesitated.
Stock prices dropped.
Tom was sitting near the window.
I did the best I could do.
I don't quite understand what you want to say.
Do you know how to use this?
I haven't washed my hair.
I don't know why he said that to me.
I thought that Tom was your friend.
Don't rush things.
I speak French more often than I speak English.
He was absent from school yesterday because he was sick.
Stop grumbling.
Tom thinks that I did that on purpose.
We're trying to find someone who can speak French.
I'd like nothing better.
I'm in a jam.
I stayed home all day long instead of going to the movies.
She cooked the dinner herself.
Guess what I want to do now.
My favorite subject is math.
Tom is a dwarf.
I'm not supposed to be here.
I thought that you were right.
I haven't been back there since.
You're cute when you're angry.
Let's not start that again.
"This is my sister, Mary."
How can we join the team?
How does that actually work?
Don't you believe it?
There are some things you've got to understand.
Where did you buy those gloves?
I don't have a beard.
I can't believe that you're really in love with me.
Tom shouldn't have left.
Do what I tell you.
I make it a point to shine my shoes before I go to bed.
He was absent from school.
We were just about to enter the room.
I don't disagree with Tom.
We need to decide today.
I don't go out much anymore.
I bought that last year.
Tom has done well.
Don't you ever knock before you enter a room?
Is Tom under arrest?
Keep the keys.
Why were you in Boston?
I'm not lying to you.
We went out for some fresh air.
Tom married Mary after her husband died.
It is impossible for him to give up smoking.
I told Tom you used to live in Boston.
Have you ever seen Tom dance?
I'll be in my car.
I can go.
I'm sure it was an accident.
Have you ever eaten whale meat?
Mary is in love with the boy with blond hair.
Tom needs to be stopped.
Don't be so selfish.
He told me that he had no time to read books.
Quiet down.
Where did Tom learn to speak French so well?
Tom told me to wait.
That was a very good speech.
"Listen, I've got to run."
Tom said he was looking for someone who speaks French.
I've never given a speech before.
Tom wanted to talk with you.
No one expected Tom to win.
Why didn't you leave me a note?
I must help her at any cost.
She has no sense of duty.
The puppy looked at her with very sad eyes.
We've kept it a secret from Tom.
Tom bought some land near Boston.
I didn't argue.
Tom came home earlier than usual today.
The front door was open.
Don't run. Walk slowly.
I don't have the slightest idea what to do.
Tom certainly tries hard.
I do not agree with you at all.
He doesn't know how to write a letter in English.
Read the article again.
You're just jealous.
Put it in the freezer.
Tom hasn't even started.
I think we'd better stay inside.
That will buy us time.
Tom had no idea who Mary was.
Don't you have classes today?
Please ask someone else.
I can't imagine what you're going through.
I played outside with everybody because weather was good today.
Tom's eyes widened in surprise.
"My TV broke, so I had to take it to get it repaired."
I'll take the more expensive ones.
Tom has found a new girlfriend.
Tom knows where I hide my key.
I wouldn't have trusted Tom either.
Let me make you some coffee.
Tom has to go to a hospital.
I'm the last one who saw Tom.
Mom is preparing a meal in the kitchen.
I didn't know Tom was crying.
He has good reason to get very angry.
Tom started the engine.
I said I'm tired of it.
You look a little pale.
You're comparing apples and oranges.
Tom has written a novel.
Won't Tom be busy tomorrow?
Why do you want to work here?
We need a little more.
Please fasten your seat belt during takeoff and landing.
Nobody came to help me.
Do you think I'm handsome?
You're asking the wrong guy.
I know exactly when that happened.
You can't go back there.
Get away!
He had to share a bedroom with his brother.
Her skirt is yellow with polka dots.
Did you win?
When did you learn to drive?
I want to know when you're going to start.
I came here to tell you what I found out.
I hate my brother.
I know Tom is a brave man.
She's drop-dead gorgeous.
Tom has a lot of plans.
"Hey, I want to talk to you."
What were you talking to Tom about?
We woke up after midnight.
The police are looking for Tom.
Group the words according to meaning.
I didn't panic.
Tom drove off into the night.
Do you ever laugh?
I'm your teacher.
I don't remember what Tom did.
That's happened to me plenty of times.
Even the fastest horse only has four legs.
We can do that right now.
I know what Tom is doing.
I want a friend.
Tom told me he didn't have much time.
The boat was clean.
Don't come complaining to me when it bites you.
I have a simple plan for getting Tom to agree.
"You don't remember, do you?"
Tom went to Boston. The rest of the family went to Chicago.
I know you miss them.
"You were a coach, weren't you?"
"He is in love with her, but he tries to conceal his feelings."
His opinion is quite different from ours.
I was going to ask you the same thing.
Your hands are cold.
Could you reduce the price a little?
I wish I could do something.
Do you really think that Tom likes Mary?
"He eats, breathes and sleeps computers."
I wouldn't do that.
I'm really unlucky.
I told you not to go by yourself.
Keep listening.
Didn't you know this was going to happen?
I knew Tom was expecting us.
Will you dance with me?
They're out of town.
Tom ran out of the room.
"Which one did Tom give you? ""That one."""
It's all over now.
You can go home.
We're in need of some food.
Tom told me he was very sorry.
Tom is just like a baby.
Tom does like you.
It is very kind of you to show me the way.
We have nothing.
She is a local government officer.
What time did you get up yesterday?
I didn't do what they told me to do.
I hope we have enough time.
It would be better if you stayed with Tom.
"As soon as I got home, I went to bed."
I'm never late.
You're unfair.
Tom and I were just talking about you.
"Tom wants to go, but he can't."
I carpool with Tom.
Tom was about thirty at that time.
I don't want to hear your excuses.
We've seen nothing.
You can stay as long as you like.
Tom can't remember where he hid the documents.
Where's the nearest store?
"You think I work for Tom, but I don't."
I owe Tom a debt of gratitude.
Tom cried softly.
What do you want to eat?
We weren't scared.
I'm efficient.
I'm always right.
Are you going with Tom?
Please shut the door behind you.
They were always making jokes.
I don't like that guy.
Tom's hobby is collecting old coins.
I don't hang out with Tom.
What does Tom eat for breakfast?
Life is never easy.
"You're not going dressed like that, are you?"
Tom didn't want to be a designer.
I need to see you soon.
Have you got a match?
Tom lives with his family.
Is there anyone there?
Don't talk to Tom that way.
I don't need your help.
Tom refused at first.
"Tom is at home today, isn't he?"
It's a trap.
Do you think we can do that?
Welcome to my life.
I knew Tom wouldn't be late.
Did you hear about what happened last night?
They blocked his proposal.
I never really liked you.
I've heard that Tom's plans have changed.
My husband is always reading in bed.
There were penguin footprints in the sand.
You didn't even tell me Tom had died.
Don't listen to Tom. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
Let's look in the garage.
None of the money is mine.
I didn't know this was your seat.
Tom has been working here since October 20th.
Let's not forget about what Tom did.
Tom showed me his room.
Just follow your heart.
This problem is much bigger than we thought.
Pardon me for interrupting you.
Would you mind if I smoke?
I don't think that anyone saw us do that.
That is my dog.
Tom will be able to do that on his own.
"Are you going to tell Tom, or should I?"
I don't need to be here.
Do you like working here?
I wonder where Tom could've gone.
May I suggest another strategy?
I thought Tom was here with you.
It's not Tom I'm worried about.
Tom didn't get home till midnight.
I hardly ever watched TV.
Tom says he's rich.
He is good at imitating her Irish accent.
Stop yelling.
I've got no choice.
My name was on the list.
You've misunderstood me.
Were you looking at her legs?
He is proficient in Farsi.
He tore out of the house.
I still respect you.
Tom isn't the champion.
I want to buy a gift for you.
We need your support.
She seems to have left for Tokyo yesterday.
I'd like to sing with you sometime.
We had a heavy rain last night.
Won't you have some coffee?
I thought that it was weird.
I have a feeling that something important is going to happen.
Tom is sitting over there.
No one ever saw such a thing.
You should read this.
You'll be staying with Tom and me.
What languages are spoken in America?
Tom used to work at the post office.
I doubt that Tom knows Mary's phone number.
Tom got hit by a truck.
"Tom is leaving at 2:30, isn't he?"
Everything's great.
That seems understandable.
Put two blankets on the bed.
I want to know why.
They're very successful.
She has just finished washing dishes.
What else did you cook?
Tom helped Mary get up.
Where were you the night that Tom was murdered?
Tom is the only man I've ever really loved.
I wasn't going to mention it.
I should've studied more.
I worked all this week.
Tom and Mary go to church together.
Please back me up!
"I'm really busy, Tom."
My computer broke yesterday.
Are you afraid of death?
Do you know that dog's name?
Tom has been working overtime.
Tom was found dead.
Could you please tell me again what school you graduated from?
Stop apologizing.
We talked about that.
Tom borrowed an umbrella from Mary.
That'd be impossible.
Tom is a rabbi.
Can you do this?
I just want to make sure that you're prepared for this.
I'm serious this time.
"Run, or else you'll be late."
I'm ready to leave.
"If John phones me, please tell him I'll be back by seven o'clock."
Tom said that he doesn't regret his decision.
"My name's Tom, too."
What Tom said was the truth.
The New York Stock Exchange closed for ten days.
Tom lives in the house he was born in.
He's still alive.
Tom asked Mary to call him later.
Do you know who has the key?
We should've anticipated this.
How long would it take you to do that?
She loves him.
Please come to Boston.
I'll manage it.
I don't remember how I did this.
Could you tell me what's going on here?
Why don't you just go home?
I was half right.
I imagine that Tom will eventually convince Mary to let him buy a new motorcycle.
I know that you weren't the one who did that.
You must've lost them.
Tom put honey in his tea.
Many people love horses.
I don't really care what you think.
Tom's best friend is from Boston.
Tom went to sleep.
I want to dye my hair red.
Tom paid a $300 fine.
How often do you have your piano lessons?
This place hasn't changed much.
Are you in a hurry?
Tom is a lovable guy.
I know some of Tom's friends.
I've completely forgotten his name.
Can I kiss you?
I know how to whistle.
Smoke appeared.
It'll take longer to tell you how to do it than to just go ahead and do it myself.
My boss was very strict.
I didn't want to come here.
How long have Tom and Mary known each other?
Tom was on the volleyball team.
Why did you go there without me?
Tom said hello to everyone in the room.
"However, I could be mistaken."
Tom said you were different.
This grocery store only sells organic food.
Tom is now paralyzed.
Could you open the window?
I collect antiques.
Tom and Mary are on the porch.
Did I ever tell you about Tom?
Tom likes to attract attention.
This can't go on.
Smoking is a disgusting habit.
Tom and I can't speak French.
Don't believe Tom.
They can't afford it.
They released all the prisoners.
"Of all the things Tom did last weekend, he says that windsurfing was the most fun."
Tom burned his clothes.
Tom is rumored to be dating Mary.
Tom didn't seem to like that.
I'm looking for work.
Tom was on his phone.
Who picked you for this mission?
Tom can't believe Mary.
Do you mean you don't know what happened?
Tom shouldn't have skipped classes.
Please come if you can.
I brought you this.
"As far as I know, he is a person who keeps his promises."
We're not going with you.
His mother sighed with relief.
I don't think that we should wait.
How was the flight?
What choice do I have?
He is old enough to tell good from evil.
We've never done this before.
Tom couldn't unlock the door because he had the wrong key.
I'm not sure I'd be much help.
Shots were heard in the distance.
"Eventually, Tom will tell me everything."
Tom looked after our dog while we were away.
What gave me away?
I must do that myself.
Tom teaches history.
Be ready to laugh at yourself.
I need to do that every day.
"You think I did that, don't you?"
We have to take precautions.
Should I wait for Tom here?
One of my suitcases is missing.
Her son was killed in a traffic accident.
"In older people, wounds take a long time to heal."
Do I have to go there right away?
You need to do that by yourselves.
We're looking for a friend of ours.
Tom's house has a tiny kitchen.
That's not a very funny story.
Tom didn't believe a word of what Mary said.
What's the big deal? People do this all the time.
Did you see anybody else?
Tom likes to listen to Mary sing.
"You think I did that, don't you?"
He left home for Spain.
Let's not get emotional.
She had an early breakfast.
You remind me of my son.
This sentence contains several mistakes.
Tom wondered how many times Mary was going to run around the track.
Tell them we're working on it.
He doesn't look happy to see me.
I like to listen to the radio.
What's cloud computing?
Did you know that would happen?
He killed that man.
I won't follow you.
That suit has an expensive look.
That's why I'm telling you not to go alone.
Tom isn't the only one who was punished.
I couldn't wake you up.
You never remember my name.
You're over-analyzing.
I wanted to do it.
We must decide.
I didn't want anything.
I've done what you've asked.
At the moment they think that the accident is due to his carelessness.
Tom handed Mary some money.
He's at her side.
Tom must be on cloud nine.
Tom pretended to be Mary's friend.
Tom was Mary's only friend when she was in kindergarten.
Does Tom know that you love him?
Tom was the only man there.
There is no hurry.
Tom can't afford it.
I'm surprised they let Tom in here.
Speak into the microphone.
Tom still lives with his parents.
I didn't wait for Tom.
I'm dying to eat something.
I don't know anything about horses.
Can you tell me where you are?
There's something in the box.
Let's go straight to the beach.
I thought you said the police would never find us here.
I need to know more about you.
I think highly of him.
I think that you're right.
I was born in 1982.
Tell Tom I don't want to talk to him.
Do you think Tom will find us?
Tom probably isn't in Australia now.
I'm eighteen.
He went back to get his hat.
Why did you need a knife?
"Tom, I'm here."
You cannot lose.
Tom is allowed to do that.
You are the very man I want to see.
Is Tom already in Boston?
That's enough for today. I'm tired.
What's for dessert?
Go and buy some bread.
Were you looking for me?
Tom can't use it.
We know who we're looking for.
He speaks English with a German accent.
I'm going to see a horror film.
Do you think it's a sign?
Was that Tom you were talking to?
Tom ran a hundred meters in twelve seconds.
We have to do that again.
They made a strange discovery.
I don't want to live anymore.
I awoke to find a bird in my room.
Do I look fat in this dress?
I'll wait another five minutes.
Tom didn't give us any details.
Tom asked Mary to wait for him here.
The opera starts at seven.
He loves rituals.
You've been convicted.
I wish I had seen her.
Tom took a taxi to the hospital.
Take my picture.
I want to do this for Tom.
Don't you have something to do?
The weather is beautiful.
I live here with my dog.
I didn't stop.
My sister showers every morning.
Can you stay?
Something's obviously wrong.
I polished my shoes.
Tom says he saw Mary.
How did this happen to me?
We are almost there.
He likes anything sweet.
Tom couldn't speak to Mary.
Tom always speaks French to me.
I can't believe you fell for it.
There are many tall buildings downtown.
What a rude comment!
We'll bring Tom.
Iran plans to launch a monkey into space.
Something is wrong here.
I'll take this coat.
Is this a gift for me?
I'm catching the 11:00 train.
Eight divided by two is four.
I thought you'd be late.
I've thought a lot about it.
No one knows that I like you.
Everyone knows what's going on.
Forget about that.
I didn't know Tom was still in prison.
Tom grew back his mustache.
Tom has never taught French.
Tom isn't as old as me.
She saved a hundred dollars.
We've got no choice.
Tom sings beautifully.
Don't be a coward.
How many cans of beer have you drunk?
We should save some cake for Tom.
Tom is never going to find out about this.
Advertisements urge us to buy luxuries.
Are you interested in that girl?
That's not very difficult.
This isn't sugar.
I knew you couldn't do it.
I give Tom money every week.
Why is she here?
"If you don't know what it means, look it up in the dictionary."
You're asking me questions you already know the answers to.
Your days are numbered.
"Suddenly, the door closed with a loud noise."
There's no need to worry.
I have a lot of dreams.
He was surprised by the sudden appearance of his friend.
Tom is in trouble. Can you help him?
Tom doesn't seem to be unhappy.
How do you know what I heard?
I told Tom that you'd want to know.
I think it'll take more than a year to finish building our house.
What's your favorite drink?
They went their separate ways.
Tom loved you very much.
This screwdriver is too small to be any use.
I'm used to the pain now.
Are you sure we've never met before?
Tom's cat was carried away by a tornado.
"Finally, I have my own car."
Ask her what she bought.
I must brush up my English.
Life is like a game of chess.
Tom opened the freezer and got out the ice cream.
We're not going to let Tom win.
I think that it's time for me to return to Australia.
I think Tom has finally fallen asleep.
I know that you believe me.
We can rest.
Do any of your friends smoke?
Why did you lie?
This is your house.
I forbid you to talk to Tom.
I am sure that he is an honest man.
I know that Tom can't win.
I'll help you find it.
I don't need a haircut.
Here's a big map of Germany.
You're going to regret this.
I was worried.
Where did you get that shirt?
Tom has refused to go.
Will you be at Tom and Mary's wedding?
Tom is a rather smart child.
"Tom couldn't speak any French, so we spoke in English."
I want you to come home.
How much is a meter of this red silk?
Tom is either at home or at work.
Divide this line into twenty equal parts.
Tom is a very nice boy.
Tom was in my room.
Tom isn't going to let Mary die.
We still haven't found Tom.
What would happen if I pushed this button?
That doesn't scare me one bit.
I don't think they did this.
How much do you expect to get out of Tom?
Your behavior was inexcusable.
We've seen this before.
Are you mad at Tom?
How many dogs do you have?
I said I was sorry.
That door won't open.
I'm the one who has to go to Australia.
Does Tom ever smile?
I think we've already wasted too much time.
I forbid you to go there.
They'll take care of you.
He had a good time in the restaurant.
"Don't be afraid, I'm here."
You're the owner.
Let's just have a look first.
We hope you don't do that.
I want Tom to cook me something to eat.
Tom shouldn't say that to Mary.
Tom and Mary have two cats.
They didn't see it.
Tom said Mary told him that.
Six comes before seven.
I don't think Tom will stay very long.
Why is my bag empty?
Was that Tom who was playing the organ at church last Sunday?
We don't yet know what we're up against.
Tom looks like a million bucks.
Tom is a family friend.
I'll work alone.
Could you give me an example?
I can solve this problem.
I wish I hadn't gone there by myself.
"The more, the merrier."
I knew you'd find me.
Tom has never used a slide rule.
I know that you don't live here anymore.
Tom took out his camera.
Where's Tom moving to?
Send me a postcard.
He drew two squares on the blackboard.
It isn't rocket science.
Do you need my help?
The flowers cheered her up.
There is some milk in the fridge.
I guess it's pretty cool.
Are you sure we have enough water?
Do you want something to read?
Let go of my hand.
"In winter, the roads are covered with ice."
Would anyone else like to say anything?
What would you like to be called?
Tom has never been kissed by Mary.
Don't forget to send that letter.
Tom said he knew what Mary was planning to do.
We were both hungry.
I thought you said Tom wasn't a member of our club.
I am playing volleyball now.
I can't express how sorry I am.
He has lost interest in politics.
Tom jumped off the bridge.
I know Tom was the last one to do that.
Tom bent over to tie his shoe.
This pigeon flew from San Francisco to New York.
"In Christianity, Jesus is believed to be the son of God."
You weren't supposed to see that.
Tom said he has nothing to hide.
I just can't believe Tom is gone.
I don't want you to go.
I don't know anything about marketing.
He drove slowly up the hill.
I know Tom is fine.
Tom hasn't finished his homework yet.
What were you doing yesterday?
Tom isn't thin.
Listen closely.
"Tom promised me he'd come, but he didn't."
I'm twice your age.
Tom looked relaxed and rested.
I want you to study French.
We can't forget that.
Who do you think told Tom?
Could I have some water?
A guard is outside.
Tom notices everything.
I'm not in love with anyone.
"If you give me Tom's phone number, I'll call him."
I'd be really grateful.
I know there was a big church there.
My father left me some property.
I'm thinking of buying a house on Park Street.
How wonderful!
I don't like your tone.
I hate hypocrites.
Give me a minute to freshen up.
Don't stay in the sun too long.
I knew you weren't to be trusted.
We knew all about it.
The last few days have been very hot.
I don't think Tom and Mary have much in common.
The room is covered with dust.
I don't like this idea at all.
We see them on occasion.
Aren't you going to apologize to Tom?
I cut classes again today.
I thought you'd be busy.
This plant grew little by little.
Tom promised he'd quit smoking.
My mom had to lend me her keys.
I'm sure that won't happen.
Tom is always online.
We danced all night long.
The girls went shopping.
We're grateful for your support.
Why are you in your pajamas?
I can't go with you because I'm very busy.
Cover your mouth.
It nearly cost me my life.
I've got nothing to say right now.
I have some bad news for you.
Tom found out the truth from Mary.
This is what I've been looking for.
They're talking with each other.
Don't you want me to go with you?
Are you saying that you killed Tom?
I thought Tom would plant the tulips near the oak tree.
Did you think I would leave you here?
Tom had a quick breakfast.
I hate it.
Tom went west.
"Hey, listen to me."
Can you really tell the future?
Tom and his family came to the train station to see us off.
You're a cruel man.
Tom was very old and ill.
I'm envious of you because you have a good boss.
Tom has been stealing food from us.
You should take advantage of this opportunity.
Don't you like Boston?
Go and talk to Tom.
How many pencils do you have?
Let's take the bus.
I suppose you'll be studying all day tomorrow.
"Tom thinks I'm going to drink this, but I'm not."
We can't waste even a minute.
Is he sleeping?
We must call the police.
I dreamed I was in Boston again.
Tom often wears black.
The boy had the dish empty in a moment.
I'll watch Tom.
You underestimate Tom.
Songs and poems were written about him.
I kept digging.
You may go home.
Don't look at me.
Does it hurt here?
This is my best shirt.
Tom tried doing that.
The box was so heavy I could not move it.
Tom filled the pot with water.
You said that you wanted to hear the truth.
Who's in charge?
I have to go to Boston.
You'll be thirty years old next year.
It made my mother cry.
I'll call you as soon as I know.
Tom always exaggerates.
"So, what exactly is your point?"
I wish Tom were here right now instead of me.
Tom took everything.
I was on patrol.
Why did you say yes?
Be tolerant.
I want to know who gave that to you.
This is my phone.
"Now, don't be late."
Tom is an ambulance driver.
Does Tom already have a job?
"When Tom looked down at the apple he was eating, he realized that he had eaten half a worm."
I saw the car explode.
Tom told me you'd died.
I was concerned.
I'm a good student.
Are you still home?
"May I have a pillow and a blanket, please?"
I know you'll have a lot of fun.
"We're all healthy, and we're really happy."
Tom has a superiority complex.
I want some ice cream.
I was too ambitious.
Would you like me to tell the truth?
I thought that you said it was yours.
I can't help you because I am busy.
Is that your own idea?
Tom shouted to Mary.
Tom glared at Mary.
Somehow I doubt it.
Trains are running on schedule.
You need a new one.
Does your dog bite?
Swear you won't do that again.
I'm tired of watching TV. Let's do something else.
I want to go.
Tom said he wouldn't be here tomorrow.
I didn't ask Tom for help.
"At dinner time, don't speak with your mouth full."
I didn't know that Tom had done that.
We were sailing.
Thanks for the feedback.
Tom didn't seem jealous.
I wish I could figure out how to finish this project without asking for help.
I wonder why tennis is played in mini-skirts.
Can we go to Boston?
Didn't you know that Tom had a house on Park Street?
I've already told everybody I'm moving to Boston.
I think I've lost my ticket.
How much food is left?
I don't usually lock my car.
A hexagon has six sides.
That's the way Tom is. You can't do anything about it.
I know Tom is nearby.
Everyone knows everyone else.
I'm glad it worked out that way.
I didn't touch your guitar.
Can't you leave me alone?
I wanted to have a word with you about what happened.
I bought her some drinks.
How tall are you?
Tom is easy to get along with.
That is out of the question.
It's the same here.
That's exactly what he said.
I advise you to wait.
I managed to get to the station on time.
Tom sleeps in the nude.
It was a real pleasure to work with Tom.
Tom didn't mind doing the dishes.
She began to sing.
How much did your helicopter cost?
He looked very tired.
I think I have the best job in the world.
The ATM is out of order.
I confessed to both crimes.
I didn't know that before.
Tom is the one who broke the vase.
He didn't acknowledge defeat.
Do you know what the time is?
I wasn't talking about anyone in particular.
Tom said he didn't have anything to write with.
You're bothering me.
I have a slight cold.
I was in Boston all weekend.
I've had a very long day.
I owe what I am to my father.
Tom got on his bicycle and rode away.
Do you want to be an astronaut?
Water was coming out of the damaged pipe.
He often writes letters to his parents.
I'm doing exactly what you told me to do.
Tom can give you an answer tomorrow.
"Tom started as a janitor, but he's now the president of the company."
What a cute little girl!
"If you don't know what the word means, look it up in the dictionary."
I prefer spring to autumn.
I think you should talk to someone.
He tries hard.
I didn't notice Tom had gone.
I don't like my neighbors.
I need you to go to the supermarket and buy some milk.
I don't think that Tom is going to be here all day.
Tom loved Australia.
The first person we saw was Tom.
I don't want to do it again.
Tom and Mary went to the zoo together.
I've decided.
How boring!
I wonder how long this will last.
Tom knows exactly what he wants.
Tom told me you're going to help him.
Don't you want to win?
I'm not going to go with you.
I knew you were lying.
Tom won't be able to solve his problems alone.
Tom and Mary are inseparable.
We wouldn't risk it.
"Judging from his expression, he's in a bad mood."
I anticipated trouble.
I hope Tom has a good time.
This food does not agree with me.
Nobody wants that bicycle.
Tom refuses to admit he made a mistake.
Tom should apologize to you.
It's not just a minor problem.
I know that Tom is sick.
You remind me of your brother.
Why don't you update your website?
They gave you another chance.
Don't tell Tom the answer.
I have to go to the dentist after school.
Tom really loved Mary.
Which one's the new one?
You've got a busy day tomorrow.
Tom came back three days later.
Tom always worries about everything.
What time did that happen?
Tom wanted to learn to play golf.
We have no other options.
I love the way you hold me.
Tom tells us jokes.
Have you ever gotten angry with Tom?
There were various objects in the room.
Tom doesn't have to go to school.
How will you escape?
Tom's mom raised him by herself.
No one gave up hope.
Have you signed the contract already?
She speaks good English.
I shouldn't have asked Tom that question.
Why do you think I'm upset?
Tom didn't even have a dog.
Tom swallowed his pride.
The baby cannot walk yet.
He is afraid of his father.
I don't have time to answer any questions.
I wanted to dance.
I used to collect stamps.
I need to get them back.
It's time for you to go to bed.
He acted as my guide.
Won't you have some more coffee?
Doesn't it bother you?
Tom bought a new set of headphones.
I used to think it wasn't a problem.
I was in Boston last weekend.
Hand it to me.
"You aren't going to call my parents, are you?"
He got involved in shady business affairs.
Do you think Tom saw Mary kissing John?
I've had a good day so far.
Do you want to pay now or later?
I didn't like Tom's cooking.
Tom wants to protect Mary.
He often quotes from Shakespeare.
What can't you do?
Tom must leave early.
Tom couldn't do that any longer.
What are you looking at?
I was in the shower.
Please remind me to do that.
I saw Tom get on the train.
I'm going to play tennis with Tom tomorrow.
Did Tom show an interest?
I was cleaning.
Tom told me he was pleased.
We're at war.
There is little water left in the glass.
Tom acknowledged that what he'd said earlier was not true.
I stepped aside for her to pass by.
I spent three hundred dollars on books.
She implied that she would like to come with us.
I'm good friends with Tom.
"That might happen to you, too."
I know the man sitting over there.
Tom didn't attend the ceremony.
You're almost as old as I am.
Tom was such a happy person.
I don't go there anymore.
I'm really rich.
No one can figure it out.
I'll call you back at about 2:30.
I found the book boring.
Have you tried taking a sleeping pill?
He will play soccer tomorrow.
Tom asked Mary about her grandmother.
Somehow you must find a way to finish this work in one month.
I can't believe this is all happening.
I knew Tom would stop Mary.
It doesn't matter whether you win or not.
It was awesome.
I told Tom I didn't care about his problems.
Is that why you came here?
He is absent from school.
He had a wonderful memory.
I got your letter.
He's standing on his head.
I knew Tom was in Australia.
She gave me some practical advice.
I thought that I told you not to come.
You can choose any color.
She has a pretty doll.
I couldn't find my keys.
Don't worry. I have insurance.
Why are you so happy today?
The years pass by quickly.
Just let me finish.
I frequently correspond with her.
Tom says he comes here every year.
Do you believe that?
Didn't you know that Tom was dating Mary?
I think everybody knew that.
I don't think that Tom can help us today.
We should hire Tom a lawyer.
Please write with a pencil.
I want you to go to Boston.
I like neither of the pictures.
I don't think I need anybody's permission to do that.
I'm sure Tom won't forgive Mary.
You've never told me about that.
I don't think you need to be at tomorrow's meeting.
Tell me a little about yourself.
Tom is playing tennis now.
I don't mind a bit.
I can't control myself.
I still dream about Tom.
Who's in first place?
I met a friend.
That's all Tom has to say.
You're a really bad listener.
Tom didn't want anything bad to happen.
Tom was Mary's best friend in high school.
I hung out with Tom yesterday.
Learning French is difficult.
The table fits here perfectly.
Tom no longer lives with me.
They must die.
Where have you been all this time?
The train was very crowded so I had to stand all the way to Ueno.
Can you explain why you don't like Tom?
He ignores my problems.
I spoke to my uncle on the telephone.
Everything that lives will die sometime.
Tom arrived.
I really missed you when you were in France.
I need hand lotion.
I suspect Tom and Mary aren't in Boston now.
It's official.
"Well, you've convinced me."
Do you trust me or not?
They couldn't stop smiling.
You're all doomed.
He's taking a nap.
"Now that you've decided to quit your job, you look happy."
You're a fraud.
You should be a writer.
I'm a little sick.
It's time to get ready for bed.
Would you please mail this letter by airmail?
Pemberton rejected the demand.
I felt the same way.
I don't remember what I have to do.
I don't remember asking you for your advice.
Where's the post office?
Let's talk about your trip to Boston.
You will need a bodyguard.
What have you done to my computer?
I brought you a sandwich.
I tried to do that.
Did you know that Tom knew Mary?
Tom isn't scared of spiders.
I can't imagine why.
Please wait in the hall.
She asked me if I knew Tom's address.
I didn't want to interfere.
I have a white cat.
"Do you need to go to Boston, too?"
That's a horrible idea.
Please say hello to your family.
Don't be so selfish.
How long are you planning on being in Boston?
I had a bad headache. That's why I went to bed early.
It's empty.
I said no.
She stared at me.
He is well acquainted with the history of England.
I would rather not go there alone.
I appeared on television once.
Your name was number three on the list.
I don't think I need to go.
I used to not eat meat.
I found my shoes.
"In the movies, ghosts can walk through walls."
Will we ever see you again?
The cat is sleeping.
When will Tom do that?
Both Tom and Mary blushed.
Tom won't even talk to me now.
Tom didn't take many pictures.
English law prohibits children under 16 from buying cigarettes.
Tom and Mary can both drive.
Tom showed Mary his garden.
I know Tom helped you.
It looks like Tom is fine.
Are these your skis?
What is the scale of this map?
Try to catch me.
I know you'll be happy here.
I want to know who used to live here.
These trousers need pressing.
The kitten is taking a nap.
I saw a dog.
Nobody likes to be kept waiting.
Tom asked me to do it.
Tom didn't call me back.
I gave a speech in French.
Put your glasses on.
Tom said that he understood French.
We should get going.
Tom needed to buy a new belt.
I ought to have anticipated this.
I regret having done such a thing.
It's about 300 miles to Boston from here.
I think Tom and Mary are still married.
Do you remember saying that?
Seven is believed to be a lucky number.
I don't care what it cost. I still want it.
I would do anything to get a job.
I need a rest.
Tom announced that Mary was missing.
Let's try to sleep.
"Tom, please hand me the hammer."
I heard you guys whispering.
Tell me what'll happen.
Tell me their names.
Do you think this is stupid?
"Shut up, he whispered."
"When you finish reading this letter, burn it."
I'm not a lazy person.
When does your summer vacation start?
Let's find out why.
I still sometimes do that.
Do you want to tell Tom?
I knew we were going to win.
Nobody's suggesting you do that.
It seems those two are made for each other.
I've washed the car.
I've been following you.
Let's bury the hatchet.
That's so incredible.
I'll tell you about it.
I can't afford it.
We had no secrets.
Have you seen any English travelers here?
How many people know you're alive?
"If you see or hear anything, let me know."
My grandfather was a farmer.
Is this new model available on the market?
Tom didn't suspect a thing.
Hold on. I'll check.
My mother made me a white dress.
I've almost finished.
Don't feed the pigeons.
How are you?
I hope you'll be happy forever.
I'll take the more expensive one.
Tom shut the drawer.
I'm trying to figure out something.
I don't think that Tom did his homework by himself.
Do you want me to be happy?
Tom isn't afraid of us.
Tom thinks Mary despises him.
Thanks to all of you.
I'm thinking of buying a new car.
Tom fell.
I know something horrible will happen.
You came at just the right time.
Now let's begin the game.
They don't understand English at all.
I'll spend the night here.
We're doing that together.
Tom's house is for sale.
Tom did that anyway.
I knew it could happen.
Were you expecting something different to happen?
I'm nearsighted.
I thought we had more time.
I'll be late today.
Tom won't come to today's meeting.
They were very busy.
I apologized to Tom for doing that.
You have to tell me the truth.
Tom wants to take a picture of it.
I haven't been here before.
They were stuck in the elevator for four hours.
The whole experiment was recorded on film.
I'm not the only one who knows your secret.
He has no chance of recovering.
There is a lot of furniture in his room.
Everybody is waiting for you.
Could the situation worsen?
Don't make the same mistakes that I did.
May I ask Tom a few questions?
Tom threw a stick for his dog.
Do that before it gets dark.
He stooped to put on his shoes.
I haven't even looked at that yet.
Tom doesn't have a driver's license.
I look forward to it.
Tom told Mary John could do that.
I know it's hard to talk about it.
I was hoping Tom wouldn't ask me to do that.
Tom pulled out his knife and peeled the apple.
I used the wrong word.
Don't talk to me about work.
Why are you helping me?
What should I do with this?
I'm going to be late.
He was excluded from the team.
I bought everything you asked for.
Tom saved your life.
Something's not right here.
I can't sit around waiting any longer.
Tom said Boston is a nice place to visit.
Tell me why Tom isn't here.
You never gave up.
Why am I so alone?
Tom told Mary he wasn't interested in helping her do anything.
Tom told me to stay here until he got back.
We enjoy watching TV.
We pitched the tent next to the river.
No one knows what to say.
Tom knows Mary won't win.
Why doesn't Tom call me anymore?
What does that refer to?
Read it again.
Tom is really hard to get along with.
I'm already over thirty.
I know when something's bothering you.
How does it feel being married to such a beautiful woman?
I used to play tennis.
Paint the fence.
I was conscripted into the army.
I don't think Tom knows why Mary was crying.
Tom couldn't remember where he'd parked his car.
Did you hear about the big earthquake in Japan?
I thought I was invincible.
We just want to help you.
All of us stood up.
He was 19 at the time.
I don't know where they hid the key.
Why were so many people here yesterday?
I've paid the bill.
I knew I'd forgotten to do something.
I feel like eating popcorn.
I'd like to have some time alone with Tom.
Tom wants to visit you.
Tom is waiting for somebody.
I hope that all your dreams come true.
Do you like your brother?
Tom is a grumpy old man.
My favorite color is orange.
Please take care of yourself.
I'll take this one.
Stay at home.
I had no difficulty in finding his house.
I'll be ready in three minutes.
I knew it wasn't you.
I thought that I was doing the right thing.
I am 4 years younger than him.
I wish that I hadn't done that.
I'll be free.
Mail this letter.
I'll check it.
I don't think anything's going to change.
I just got an idea.
I'd like you to help me do this.
Have you found out anything?
Will I ever see you again?
I'm not that hungry.
He's very shy. He says he wants to see you.
Tom didn't let me talk.
Do you know my father?
This tastes bad.
Tom is a good friend of mine.
"If I knew his address, I would get in touch with him right away."
I'm expecting Tom to win.
Her lack of money kept her from going with me.
Tom braided Mary's hair.
You're the only one who can solve this problem.
Tom is cleaning the living room.
The seats are all sold out.
"Well, it turns out you were right about Tom."
Tom wasn't crazy.
I'm glad that you came.
He has more books than I do.
I saw Tom kissing Mary.
There's narrow road to the village.
"Tom died, but Mary didn't."
What do you intend to do with that?
Tom began to speak.
"No matter what you say, I won't do that."
I don't think that Tom wants to see Mary.
Is she a taxi driver?
You can't imagine how hungry I was.
My umbrella broke.
The men all wore hats.
I said leave Tom alone.
Nature endowed her with wit and beauty.
Tom almost never calls Mary.
Tom was in Boston with me.
Does that mean you'll stay?
She promised not to tell anyone.
Do you have a coin?
Tom will forgive Mary.
I slammed the door shut.
Tom has a toothache.
I wasn't expecting you until 2:30.
Where are the photos?
"Tom is a student, not a teacher."
He touched her on the shoulder.
You could've stayed in Boston.
They don't have jobs.
Tom is no killer.
Tom died almost instantly.
Where can I buy a program?
He gave me a watch.
I don't know if it's true.
Would you prefer to do nothing?
"Yeah, that's what I said."
Tom assured me that it won't happen.
I have a very pretty girlfriend.
What are you doing in my room?
I told Tom not to believe Mary.
Tell Tom everything.
We've corrected the situation.
I'm still waiting for an answer.
I think that's a bad suggestion.
Stop wasting my time.
Tom didn't even bother leaving a note.
"If he knew her phone number, he could call her."
I'll leave Tom alone.
Tom knows something that we don't know.
The volcano has become active again.
Nothing interests me anymore.
I've got to find it.
We must find Tom.
What else could Tom do?
I sleep with two quilts in the winter.
How did you know that that was going to happen?
Everyone is afraid of Tom.
Can I go home?
I heard you just got married.
Tom has got to be at least thirty years old.
Nobody had ever asked Tom that question before.
Tom doesn't have anyone to discuss his problems with.
I asked Tom why he never studied French.
I will look after your cat while you are away.
She helped the old man cross the road.
I'll check again.
The river rose above the level of the dam.
I can't believe we did that.
I commend Tom for his bravery.
How old were you when you started studying French?
Don't worry about it.
Tom is my only true friend.
They are well off.
I'm looking for my cat.
He likes this book.
I don't feel comfortable here.
You won't regret it.
I can not bear this noise any more.
I'm sure you'll make the right choice.
I lucked out.
Do you have friends in Boston?
Is that all you're going to tell me?
I want to go to bed early.
Tom is an out-and-out liar.
Tom took off his wedding ring and threw it into the pond.
I'm sure it won't be easy to do that.
All were present.
What's the difference between this one and that one?
The only true language in the world is a kiss.
Tom said that Mary is mad.
"All of a sudden, it began raining."
I like a lot of things.
You should've called the cops.
Tom didn't tell me why.
I know Tom was offended.
Enter the information into the computer.
"To tell the truth, she is my cousin."
It was a fast delivery.
Tom claims he never said that.
I look forward to it.
Tom hasn't been here since last October.
"I think Tom can speak French. However, I could be wrong."
Take me to them.
I'll have to go there tomorrow.
I didn't tell Tom who my father was.
When did you buy this bicycle?
What would you like for breakfast?
I would like to visit South Korea.
I need to know how to do this.
I can't talk now.
I hardly believed it myself.
What happened to the money?
Tom told her.
I couldn't tell whether Tom was asleep or not.
Tom put the book back on the shelf where it belonged.
Are you going to kiss me?
Did they say how?
It's a good start.
I'd like you to join us.
There were only three survivors.
Didn't you know Tom didn't need to do that?
I can't do that either.
I don't know what I'll do next week.
I knew you'd come back to me.
I'll never lie to Tom.
We can't fail again.
Men should work.
How much fruit do you eat every day?
Tom may go with you if he wants.
Tom couldn't wait to see Mary.
They refused to let us go.
The colony declared independence and became a republic.
Let's hold hands.
It rained hard yesterday.
Tom and I went fishing.
Hurry up and finish your breakfast.
I know you better than your wife does.
Help me move this desk.
We don't have any more water.
Tom gestured for Mary to enter.
"I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you."
I am not interested in politics at all.
I'm the only one who has done that.
He adhered to the original plan.
My daughter is going to buy new furniture.
I'm the only one who understands.
Are you going to tell me your name?
You have three cats.
Have you told anyone else about this?
They want more money.
There is no money in my bag.
I'm adopted.
Don't be afraid to be yourself.
"Hey, wait for me."
That's a big loss.
There's a phone in the kitchen.
I have a jealous husband.
You can't leave me here.
There are many bad people in the world.
I'd rather help someone else.
That's Mary's husband.
Tom and Mary aren't happy.
The match ended in a draw.
Is this lake deep?
Tom was taken to the hospital in an ambulance.
There's a farm close by.
Is this the right way to the station?
Everybody speaks well of her.
Tom isn't the only boy in the room.
Just trust me.
I've already forgotten his name.
She despised him.
We're both going to be there.
"Who else, other than you, knows about Tom's past?"
I'm old enough to vote.
Tom introduced himself as Mary's ex-husband.
The tea we had there was excellent.
What did he want to know about me?
I think Tom likes me.
I've decided to try doing that by myself.
Do you know the people who live here?
She saw him break the window.
I wish Tom would come to Boston.
I need help.
I went there yesterday.
Your question is hard for me to answer.
I've never heard Tom speaking French before.
Where did you go skiing?
He showed off his new car.
I can't believe I'm actually doing this.
Why don't we talk over coffee?
Tom has a Canadian girlfriend.
Is the park open today?
How many windows are there in your bedroom?
I know that neighborhood.
Did I forget to mention that?
This is a very rare specimen.
Did Tom actually eat a frog?
Tom suggested we come back tomorrow.
You promised you wouldn't tell.
How many times do I have to say that I'm not married?
How did you do that so quickly?
Maybe he will be a good teacher.
Perhaps we overlooked something.
We were sailing.
"In that regard, I agree with you."
Why do I have to fight?
It's my biggest problem.
Tom caught a snowflake on his tongue.
I should've never trusted Tom.
I prefer apples to oranges.
Tom was shot through the heart with an arrow from a crossbow.
I haven't been looking for a job.
I've always wanted to learn to cook like you.
Tom couldn't finish his dinner.
I'm going to take a nap.
Tom's thrilled.
I know who your father is.
Tom bought Mary something to eat.
Don't move unless I tell you.
Tom said you'd come.
I think it's dangerous to swim in this river.
We got on the bus there.
Tom says he has to speak French.
I often do that in the afternoon.
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
This is our main goal.
Copy this program on your computer.
Tom pestered us with questions.
I didn't know you were hungry.
Wait a few more days.
"He wrote a sentence on the paper, but I didn't understand the sentence."
When are you coming back home?
A rainbow is a natural phenomenon.
Tom probably won't even go.
You look Japanese.
Do you know who it was?
I have a friend who works at that store.
Tell me where it is.
How did you know I was here?
The dog attacked the little boy.
I don't think that I could live without you.
What did Tom want to buy?
The police suspect Tom is a serial killer.
Tom stood between Mary and John.
He pretended not to know me.
I must hurry to catch the train.
You're optimistic.
I know Tom is about to cry.
I've had a headache for three days and I can't get rid of it.
You did what you had to.
Could you take a photo of me?
So what are your plans?
I'm happy to hear you're doing well.
Today is my parents' wedding anniversary.
I won't ask you to do that.
Somebody's taken Tom's place.
Tom forgot his sweater.
We got lost in the forest.
Why are you standing?
Did you cook this yourself?
We have a 20% share of the market.
It's an ambush!
I'll do anything you say.
Do you know all these people?
You must stay with me.
I'm related to you.
He wants to save the planet.
How exciting!
This road leads to the river.
Who do you know there?
Tom is terribly disappointed.
I'm running for city council.
I prefer going out to staying at home.
He handed over all his property to his son.
I must ask you about Tom.
Tom heard his parents arguing.
Tom said he'd like to talk to you.
What do you think of my theory?
I bought a ticket to Boston.
It hurt me deeply.
She passed away yesterday afternoon.
He's tall and handsome.
Luck turned in my favor.
I've always wanted to kiss you.
You look like you're tense.
Who used to live here?
Tom wants us to go with him.
Why aren't you wearing a hat?
Can you start today?
Where did Tom get this stuff?
Make a decision.
Let me help you.
They don't want us to know.
Tom was nowhere to be found.
I knew Tom was different.
That hotel has a homey atmosphere.
I thought you left with Tom.
How do we change this?
I don't think Tom knows when Mary got back from Boston.
Will you explain it in plain English?
Tom is three months older than me.
It was cheaper than I thought it would be.
There are three windows in my room.
Please be very careful.
Tom had a knife in his hands.
Washing clothes is my work.
Luck is against me.
Don't take off your shoes.
My father has bought a new car.
Tom is going to work today.
Don't be fooled again.
What's wrong with my hair?
Not all animals are scared of fire.
Who notified you?
"After work, I go right home."
This meant Florida had to count the votes again.
He neglected his duties.
You touched my heart.
That never worked.
Tom had a rough day.
It's really very simple.
Tom is never going to catch me.
Tom is a fat man.
I've never been to a funeral.
Aren't you happy with your new sports car?
I thought Tom would be hungry.
Tom forgot who said it.
Tom often asks for my advice.
I don't think I offended anybody.
I don't know what to do next.
Safety is always our concern.
He must find work.
He came in spite of bad weather.
I was in such a hurry that I forgot to lock the door.
The men are eating lunch.
They don't need a reason.
I don't want Tom to move to Australia.
Tom knew that Mary was afraid.
I don't trust beautiful women.
She sang better than him.
The door is open now.
I could hear Tom and Mary laughing.
I never asked Tom to wait.
Sit down on that chair and try to calm yourself.
It's been raining again.
Can I have some hot chocolate?
I thought you'd seen this movie.
I'm unlucky.
Tom is learning how to drive a car.
Why didn't you help me escape?
Your shoes are dirty.
I was worried.
Tom told me you work for Mary.
"Let me come, too."
"The floor is slippery, so be careful."
I don't think that Tom did it.
They probably saw our ship come into port.
What exactly does Tom need to do?
Maybe Tom asked Mary to lie.
I fell asleep in class yesterday.
Do you think this is funny?
Are you sincere?
Are you still upset about what happened?
It's not here.
Do you want me to open the windows?
Get out of our house.
Tom told the authorities that he saw Mary being abducted by aliens.
I wasn't hurt in the accident.
How much did you pay the electrician?
Is that another joke?
We only kissed once.
I know that voice.
Do you agree with me?
Who'll help you?
"If you hadn't done it, someone else would have."
Tom didn't want to go into the cave.
I owe Tom money.
Did you make any mistakes?
Wow! That looks delicious.
What's going to happen?
Do you see the puppy?
Do you have a pet?
We went shopping for clothes.
He can't buy himself a car.
Why did you help Tom escape?
I'm real proud of Tom.
Is it Christmas again already?
Tom wants to know if you're planning to come to his party.
That's exactly what I told Tom.
He bought an English book at a bookstore.
She married him for his money.
The dish smells good.
You know too much.
I probably won't be forgiven.
Tom has a muscular body.
We're just children.
What I don't understand is why.
Tom likes snow.
Tom ran.
You look just like Tom looked thirty years ago.
Can you read French?
I often run into her at the supermarket.
"Tom, I want you to listen to this."
Why did you keep that a secret?
The decision was still in the air.
We're not leaving you here.
Please call me later.
He jumped across the puddle.
I'll keep that if you don't mind.
I have a sweet tooth.
Do you want to drink some water?
Her aim in life is to become a movie star.
Tom and I haven't seen each other since we were in kindergarten.
We have a farm.
The girls had a catfight.
That sounds like a bad idea.
Tom wasn't a soldier.
Neither Tom nor Mary is here.
Here's the list Tom gave me.
I don't like fried food.
Go be with Tom.
Publish or perish.
He's two years older than I am.
She was wounded by a shot in the leg.
I brought you your medicine.
I won't be a minute.
When are you going to do that?
Tom picked flowers for Mary.
He has nothing to do with it.
Tom thought that Mary was John's sister.
Do you believe in astrology?
Did we have any English homework due tomorrow?
I was eating dinner then.
I just want to get back to work.
Tom said more than he had intended.
What did you and Tom do?
I need to talk to Tom about something.
I know you can't play the guitar.
Was it a robbery?
We can hear you.
Tom expected Mary to help him.
You're lucky that my dog didn't bite you.
The door handle is broken.
That wine is good.
"You haven't told anybody, have you?"
She was the first one to notice him.
Tom and I made a pact.
Tom has more books than Mary does.
Tom is in the room.
That's all Tom needed.
You never pay attention to me.
Would you mind closing the window?
Tom can keep a secret.
I've been told to help you.
Do you eat octopus?
He can play baseball.
I've been waiting for this.
I have once been to Europe.
Which one is more expensive?
Please fax me the application form.
Tom is very cunning.
I think that everybody knows.
I'll miss you so much.
Have you read all these books?
I wonder what Tom is going to do with his old motorcycle.
I already told my friends that I was going.
Is Tom going to win?
Tom is timid.
I felt tired last night.
Tom didn't want to apologize to me.
"Though they're twins, they don't have many interests in common."
I don't want to know why you don't like me.
We're going to see if we can do that.
What do you want from life?
Tom had no more water.
Tom hates hot weather.
I didn't know Tom would be afraid.
"Unfortunately, I missed all the fun."
That's life.
Be careful not to burn yourself.
Is there any place around here that rents bicycles?
What'll you be doing over the weekend?
I think you'll want this.
"What makes you happy, Tom?"
I don't know where this belongs.
What do we have?
I don't have time to be bothered by such small things.
Tom heard voices outside.
I saw the way you were looking at Tom.
Are you working on something new?
I want you to trust me.
Tom is better at doing that than me.
I already know what I wanted to know.
There goes our bus.
Tom wants to ask us a few questions.
I don't think you have to do that by yourself.
Are you interested in the job?
Do you want to see a picture of Tom?
I'm not ready to be a mother.
I think I'm a good singer.
I'm ugly.
You need to be patient.
Tom found a snake in his tent.
No one has ever complained about that.
Don't eat too much cake.
I told Tom I got fired.
Can you come to Boston?
I've decided that I'll never try doing that again.
I know what you know.
This soup needs a bit more salt.
I have problems with my short-term memory.
Tom kept his suspicions to himself.
Tom was nervous before the race.
I have caught a cold.
Tom claimed he was innocent.
Do you know how to play the banjo?
We couldn't understand her logic.
We've got to find somewhere to hide.
I wish that I hadn't married you.
Next year will be tough.
"Well, let's get going!"
Where should I put the tray?
I don't think Tom likes to do that.
Let us know if you can make it.
He began singing.
I don't want to speak to anybody else.
You don't get enough exercise.
Her oldest son is not married.
Tom usually has lunch at noon.
Tom doesn't like my family.
He is still alive.
I hope Tom didn't get jealous.
We won't be doing that.
Tell me how I can help.
I am out of work.
He showed me around.
Tom could be involved.
Did you know his name?
I can't do it right now.
Can you zip up my dress?
Let's not talk about that now.
His teeth were white.
Mary forgot her purse in her car.
Tom wants to see me.
Tell me it's not true.
You're fair.
The Rhine flows between France and Germany.
"Here, try it on."
Did I pronounce your name correctly?
What shall I do next?
You're kidding!
Be nicer to your sister.
Is Tom interested?
Why don't you ask Tom yourself?
I think this is fair.
The leaves have all fallen.
I'll find a way.
Tom will never believe that I did it on purpose.
Laughter is good for your health.
Tom looks happier than usual.
That's exactly what I want to know.
I saw the children walk across the street.
These cars are big.
Tom said he'll wait.
You haven't touched your food.
Tom didn't give me time to think.
I will go there by plane.
I don't think Tom will be cold.
What do you want?
I don't understand you.
Have you come to save me?
I thought I was making some progress.
Tom wasn't the one who convinced Mary to do that.
Someone attacked Tom.
You could help me.
I like you better.
I know you're conservative.
It's snowing again.
I'm sorry I can't be of more help.
I'm not old enough to join the army.
The book was published in 1689.
You're back again.
Tom didn't tell me everything.
We're not going to eat anything.
I can solve this problem.
Where is the store?
I'll wait for you in Boston.
It took a long time for me to do that.
Pretend you didn't see me.
Tom died last winter.
"Have a good weekend, everyone."
Tom says he can't trust anybody.
I'm allergic to fish.
We stole it.
Would you trust them?
I used to live near a park.
It's very complicated.
Tom liked you.
Tom and Mary celebrated their success.
Tom has been in Boston for three days.
The last bus had already gone when I got to the bus stop.
Tom decided not to attend the meeting.
Tom said that he's never eaten sushi.
I would act differently in your place.
It's almost dawn and nothing's happened yet.
I'd prefer not to sing today.
I need this.
Tom refuses to retire in spite of his age.
Tom said that he doesn't like this color.
I came here when I was four.
I think Boston is worth visiting.
Why didn't you tell me that?
Tom wants to be near you.
I'm in the middle of something.
Tom might talk to Mary.
Tom did his job.
Don't hide your face.
Tom drove like mad.
Thermometers often go below zero.
These are yours.
I watched a movie in French with English subtitles.
What're your plans?
She was ready to give him back all his money.
Those two don't get along.
I changed my clothes.
"Dogs have masters, cats have servants."
Where were you the night that Tom was murdered?
Why don't you go play outside?
Tom wants to talk to me.
I was half right.
Tom didn't need to wait in line.
Tom hopes Mary won't win.
Tom won't be allowed to leave.
Does it rain a lot in Boston?
I looked for Tom.
It's cold now in Boston.
Tom is never going to see you again.
Tom told Mary that he wasn't hungry.
I'd like to have a word with you.
Women seem to go for Tom.
I paid.
I'll leave early.
Tell me why you don't want to do that.
Did you push the button?
I'm not the least bit interested in finding out who my birth parents are.
